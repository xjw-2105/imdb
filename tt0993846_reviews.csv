notoriousCASK,"Oct 24, 2018",9/10,"It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made."
karolin-99263,"Dec 29, 2020",10/10,"The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story. Martin Scorsese never fails to impress. One of the only example where the movie is better than the book. The movie never gets boring, I could watch this anytime."
abdulazizalsaad-73053,"Apr 12, 2021",10/10,"Di caprio was robbed in the oscars whether you like it or not, the only reason why people give this movie a low rating is because of the over nudity, and it's the same reason why leo didn't get the oscar in my opinion, which is what I don't understand!!!, it's an r rated movie, so obviously there will be nudity, it's not a kid's movie!!!! , it's easily leo's best performance and scorcese's second best movie after goodfellas."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Nov 29, 2023",10/10,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.Martin Scorsese isn't just a film maker, he's a genius, he's The Master of film, and this is another of his jewels. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my all time favourites.The remarkable story of Jordan Belfort, is love to know how much of this is actually true. There are multiple shocking scenes, my jaw dropped multiple times, one thing is clear, money talks.It's shocking, but it's also hilarious, there are so many funny moments, that scene with the dog at the end of the bed, too funny.Production values are off the charts, this film truly looks tremendous, it feels as though no one frame is wasted, no opportunity is missed to show off the wealth, the orgy of sex, drugs and money.Another stellar performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, he is outstanding as Belfort, one of his very best, not only does he look the part, but he exudes the character's greed's and desires.Robbie and Hill are first rate. It gets an extra point for featuring Joanna Lumley, albeit in a small role.A fascinating story.10/10."
kosmasp,"Jun 18, 2014",9/10,"There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it, don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving ""carefully"", that has to be seen to be believed ..."
bob the moo,"Jan 17, 2014",N/A,"This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it."
diegocoda,"Sep 22, 2021",10/10,"The movie is just the best, the acting is great and even I say that it was Oscar-worthy and the plot is simply one of the best ones; the message that it brings to you that money brings power and it is not always for the best because in this movie we see the downfall of a man that will learn that actually in life the money can be a drug and will simply make you cause damage to yourself."
evanston_dad,"Jan 9, 2014",5/10,"Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess, stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene, for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C"
alexscott-35299,"Nov 15, 2021",10/10,"This movie is absolutely amazing and it deserved way more Oscar wins. Leonardo DiCaprio is unbelievable and this movie is his best performance and he isn't the only one putting in an amazing performance, this film is littered with them, Jonah Hill is amazing, Margot Robbie is so good to say this was her first major role. I love the story that this movie is telling and the direction on how they tell it is amazing aswell. This is easily one of the best movies of all time and it will go down in history as one of Leo's best ever movies. I love it so much!"
Serge_Zehnder,"Dec 17, 2013",N/A,"Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole."
ClaytonDavis,"Dec 17, 2013",9/10,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?"
Al_The_Strange,"Dec 29, 2013",9/10,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"

TheConnoisseurReviews,"Dec 25, 2013",9/10,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however,  there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations.The cast brings their ""A"" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film really showcases his diverse range.Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs. The cast is fantastic and DiCaprio gives his best and most fun filled performance to date. I really enjoyed this movie and think it's the funniest movie of the year 4.5/5"
mr_iceman,"Jan 27, 2014",6/10,"Let me start of with the basics, prior to watching this movie I heard the city of Dubai censored this movie down by ~40mins by cutting out rude scenes involving sex, nudity and so forth. At first I was rather flabbergasted at this opinion, however when I saw this movie last night, I realized they had every right to do so. Most of the scenes dragged on way beyond it's point where it started venturing near a soft porn clip.The movie will be much more enjoyable had it been a 2hr running time with 85% of the useless sexual references removed. If I wanted to see something as full-frontal I would have watched Eyes Wide Shut.To me it seemed the jump from the garage operated boiler-room to the full-blown office was slightly over expedited. We never got to see Jordan's ""lows"".Leo does a fabulous job with his performance however as the title suggests, I think the movie had better potential in many different ways.Final thought? If you're a Leo die-hard fan, watch it, otherwise be prepared for a soft-porno of drugs and sex."
tomsview,"Jun 14, 2014",9/10,"An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 10, 2014",7/10,"Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a regular guy from Long Island working at the ground level in a Wall Street firm where Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) is the star broker. On the first day of him becoming a licensed stockbroker, the market crashes in Black Monday. His firm goes bankrupt and he's thrown into the streets. With the support of his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti), he ends up working in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks. He starts his own firm gathering a group of questionable salesman like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He quickly rises gaining the attention of FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). It is a drug-filled, stripper-strutting, midget-throwing wild-partying office. Jordan has an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) and eventually even marrying her. However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing. Leo gives a full-out performance."
cricketbat,"Dec 28, 2021",4/10,"One of the many reasons The Wolf of Wall Street didn't sit right with me is that I couldn't tell what it was trying to say. It seemed to glorify what Jordan Belfort and his cohorts did instead of condemning it. And at some points, the movie that was trying to tell us about deplorable debauchery became deplorable debauchery itself. It's an interesting story featuring good acting, but overall it's just kind of disgusting."
andrewcappelletti,"Nov 30, 2013",N/A,"The last few Scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. I had begun to think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening, and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completely blown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed, I cringed, I related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment. A good book, a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get Scorsese a best director Oscar, and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!"
gavin6942,"Feb 3, 2014",8/10,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...)Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing."
mayel714,"Dec 30, 2013",10/10,"By far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director! The whole supporting cast is excellent as well. This movie will not disappoint it was much better than I expected and the duration of the movie is not felt at all. It definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production. Scorsese put this movie together brilliantly! You are on your toes and engaged throughout from beginning to end. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best! He will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an Oscar Winning Performance. I read about Jordan Belfort and it appears that Scorsese and DiCaprio made this movie as accurate as possible which I really appreciate. I commend Scorsese and DiCaprio for keeping this epic picture as authentic as possible. After all this is Hollywood."
ericjams,"Dec 25, 2013",6/10,"When the final cut spun in some back room, I wonder what Scorsese thought he had here, a comedy, a thriller, a drama. This movie has a little bit of everything, but the sum of its parts adds up to very little. Very little that we as movie goers have not already seen 100 times before and nothing that I necessarily needed to sit through 168 minutes to see again.The lack of a conscience, the drive to make money at all costs, these are things we all already associate with Wall Street. So when Leo takes his messed up principles and quickly turns his smooth talking ways into millions of dollars, the audience says to itself, OK, now what? How will the story turn dark, how will the greed and booze catch up to these guys, because it always does, right.Wrong. The plot here floats at the surface to allow the merry pranksters of Leo and Jonah Hill to basically do whatever it is they want throughout the entire movie. The parties and intoxication are normally something I love, its fun to watch people party and do drugs (at least for me). Here, the excess becomes tiresome, and that would be fine, if the film was intended to show the perils of excess. But that's not the intent, the negative effects of the drugs is touched upon, and as the plot slowly veers toward the end for our wild wall street bunch, the drugs naturally move the plot deeper down the rabbit hole, but its too much after awhile and thus the film becomes a caricature of itself. A comedic display of excess that the viewer may enjoy like an exaggerated drawing, but not something that has any staying power.Scorsese may have realized this, so the plot meanders through FBI investigations, ship wrecks off the coast of Italy and Swiss Bank fraud. Its the classic example of throwing too much at the window and hoping something sticks. I found the plot to be unnecessarily bloated, I found the story to be largely superficial, and I found the actual direction to not be nearly as good as Scorsese's past films.Leo and Jonah are fantastic, some of the bit actors are good, but there is no real story here. It's just a party with consequences that do not seem to bother the characters and therefore, never really create any tension in the narrative. Its an enjoyable film at best, a plodding, repetitive, shell of a movie at worst. You be the judge."
Theo Robertson,"Jan 21, 2014",8/10,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal ""In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic formTo be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ?This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director."
secondtake,"Jan 16, 2014",7/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)First of all—yes, this is a zany, hepped up ride, and it's intense and tiring and impressive. ButAs crazy as the hedonism here is, this is a notably straightforward telling of the tale of a stockbroker's rise and fall. And as energized as it is, it's also monotonous. You can't quite say it's boring—or maybe you can, because after the fifth or fifteenth party overflowing with drugs and prostitutes you go from numb to restless —but it occurs to you later: the story is thin, as a narrative structure.Too bad. This could have been edited to a 90 minute movie—it's TWICE that as it stands—and it would have had even more velocity and energy. And maybe a few details would be left out, but you know what? They wouldn't matter! In fact, all that matters is the single large arc as Belfort builds a stock trading company out of nothing—out of a garage, literally—and then sees the FBI roll in toward the end.Don't get me wrong—Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing, covering the whole terrain from drugged out of his mind to inspirational speaker, from down in the dumps to innocently hopeful. He's so ""on"" in every scene it's a marvel. And around him are some equally strong players, such as Jonah Hill as his second in command. The women have less to do (more on that in a sec) but the woman playing Belfort's wife, Margot Robbie, gives the character more depth than you might expect, and with a great New Yorker working class accent.Scorsese directs this as he always directs—with absolute force. He doesn't know the word subtle, which is fine (which is great overall—we have other, subtle directors). Whether you look at ""Shutter Island"" or ""Hugo"" or this movie (all recent examples), you see someone who is worth following closely. He's one of the great directors we have. If all of these movies have flaws, they have so many other things going for them you end up impressed, and maybe even moved.But moved—emotionally moved—is not the result of this film. You can say that was on purpose (people have). Fine. But that means the bacchanalia is what it is. You watch and watch. And it's such a man's world—and I mean men with their testosterone unchecked, supplemented, worshipped—that women are almost totally there as toys and companions. For sex and for sex. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, if you're a woman or not, or if you have politics on this one way or the other. It remains clear that we see nothing from their point of view, and we are made to accept (as a viewer in a chair) this unevenness. It's actually sickening, if you give it the time of day. And if you really study it, you see that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is yet another film that trumpets a male over female system as good, or as inevitable.Maybe it is! (I'm not defending sexism here, hold on.) But maybe you need the testosterone to be as greedy, cruel, mindless, and driven as all the men in this movie are (including the FBI guy in his ""dignified"" way). Maybe this is another way to condemn the mosh pit of Wall Street completely. Maybe there's another way to run an economy, to have corporations make things in a competitive world.Probably not, but you do strain a bit to give the movie some rationale. The real content here is more gut level—intensity and insanity. It's amazing. But it is what it is, too, an expert docudrama with surprisingly few surprises."
Michael_Elliott,"Jan 14, 2014",N/A,"The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)**** (out of 4)Two word review: A Masterpice.Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah, it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes, there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry, I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people, their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film, sell him something. Well, DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography, the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages."
zetes,"Dec 31, 2013",8/10,"Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious."
mattschauer28,"Feb 15, 2021",10/10,"I don't review moves often, but this movie is so good in so many ways. The performance from Leo is a once in a life time one, and he should of won the Oscar but you can't change the past. However, with the mix of crime, drama and comedy, this is probably my favorite movie ever. With the edition of Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie's strong supporting performances this movie is a definite must watch."
lee_eisenberg,"Dec 29, 2013",10/10,"Martin Scorsese must be a director who can't make a bad movie. Most of his movies have focused on streetwise lowlifes, and so now he looks at a different kind of lowlife: the Wall Street kind. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Having come of age in the '80s, Belfort was convinced that there was nothing wrong with greed, and so he stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort as an amoral slimeball leading a hedonistic, frat boy lifestyle: drugs, booze, hookers, the whole shebang. And yet the whole thing is very funny.There have been complaints that the movie glorifies greed and egotism by portraying the characters having a lot of fun. I'd say that the movie is showing how they don't have a care in the world. They make millions and spend it on their own decadence.No, it's not Martin Scorsese's best movie, but you're sure to have a lot of fun watching it (understanding of course that the characters are NOT good people). I recommend it."
travola-35109,"Mar 12, 2023",10/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a masterpiece of excess, corporate greed, theft, drug use, and everything in between. Every time I watch this film I appreciate it more and it's become one of my favorite films. It's an underrated comedy with amazing performances. Jonah Hill is incredible and really became Danny and was so funny with no just his dialogue but his mannerisms. To me this is one of Leo's best performances and this is a film he should have won an Oscar for. The drug fueled phone call and drive Home Screen alone should have brought him the prize. The physical comedy Leo gives us in that scene is a shinning light in his career and shows how great he is at playing the Villain who has insane charisma. All of these people are horrible and they deserved to be in prison for much longer because they just stole from everyone and ruined peoples lives for their own gain and essentially got a slap on the wrist for it. That's why a lot of people hate the film because todays world is full of criticism of these major issues but no action. It's easier to complain and try and get rid of a piece of media made for entertainment than actually down together to make change.It's fun film about awful people with career performances from some of the best actors of this era of Hollywood."
siderite,"Feb 3, 2014",7/10,"It is difficult to watch a movie that you absolutely know how it will end. Scorsese is known for casting Leo diCaprio as the young energetic underdog that gets the world, only to lose it wholesale. The other movies of this sort, though, were interesting because they featured the criminal underworld or some other bizarre and exotic environment. The Wolf..., in comparison, is a movie about spammers and thieves that get drunk and high all the time in order to keep up with their own fantasies about their lives. Really, you could make it about Romanian hackers and it would have been a much better and fun film, with the same general ideas.Even worse for this three hour movie, Matthew McConaughey appears in a tiny role at the start of the film and explains it all: you don't want to make money for the client, you want to keep him betting on stocks, getting fabulously rich - on paper, while you get hard cash from commissions. The basic trade that we are supposed to empathize with is phone spamming and conning greedy and uninformed clients.The money that gets generated for the stock traders ""more than we knew what to do with"" doesn't go into ""diversification"", doesn't go into growing the people that until then were hungry bastards looking to pay their mortgage, it isn't invested into anything. It just goes on expensive cars, yachts, prostitutes, drugs and trophy wives. And while I admit many people would sell their soul to get to the point where they can do that, the outcome of such a behavior is obviously not good if that is all you do.And I am not being moralizing here. Hell, screw the bitches and snort the dope, but do something with yourself, plan for when the money will not be so good, make sure you will never get screwed over by technicalities, government agents, false friends or accidents. Instead the characters in the film act like there is no tomorrow. Literally they behave like the end of the world is around the corner. For three hours. It quickly gets old.There is some value in the ending, when DiCaprio's character is terrified he is going to get to jail, only to discover than when you have money, it isn't that bad at all, but other than that I just wanted to see the film end. There is no cat and mouse game with the FBI, nothing comes as a surprise, it just goes on and on with how wonderful it is to have enough money to spend it stupidly when you earn it by praying on people even more stupid than yourself.Bottom line: while DiCaprio makes a good role - after all, he is a damn good actor - the film itself is only mildly entertaining. Considering it is based on an autobiographical book, you might forgive the film for being too real and too boring, but there is still the matter of why someone would choose to make a movie on such a material. I watched the film with two other people and they were both awed by the opulence depicted in the film and the comparison of their own lives to that of the protagonists. I guess there is that; learn that if you are ingenious enough, hungry enough, you can make yourself have all the money in the world. Perhaps Scorsese wanted this, or perhaps he missed the point with me, because all I felt when the film was over is that I am happy with my life and I am glad the movie finally ended.It is interesting to read about Jordan Belfort, that's a real person. Also, his story is told in another movie from 2000, called Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Might be worth a look."
thinker1691,"Mar 29, 2014",9/10,"The greatness of a memorable film emerges from an exceptional Director like Martin Scorsese. This film entitled "" The Wolf of Wall Street "" was written by Jordon Belfort who's malicious deceptive practices eventually earn him a stint in Federal Prison. Taken from the excessive exploits of Jordon Belfort himself, it tells the story of a unemployed Wall Street executive who was abruptly lay-ed off but despite his fall, landed on his feet. Despite falling, he arose quickly to create a new financial institution which not only netted him millions, but created a whole new way to acquire further riches. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, an enterprising salesman with a golden gift of gab. Inspired by Matthew McConaughey and his own convincing talent, Belfort take a converted Garage, added an exceptional sales crew, transform them into a sea of voracious financial sharks like Rob Reiner. Belfort then creates a lucrative financial institution which nets them untold millions. Achieving his ultimate success, he continues onward and upwards attracting the attention of Wall Street itself and of course agent Patrick Denham of The F.B.I. In addition, Belfort also seeks out and weds the love of his life Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) who brings romantic security and domestic headaches as well.The movie is fast paced, money, drug and sex oriented along with the life style of the rich and famous. DiCaprio is in his element in this movie as are the talented actors of Scorseses' cast, who showcase what can happen when unbridled greed meets unrestricted wealth. This film will rank as a Classic in time and will become a milestone for Scorsese and Decaprio. Recommended, but with definite warning to one and all. ****"
rohit-k,"Jan 2, 2014",7/10,"I have two main points to say, first being Mr.DiCaprio has delivered a cracker of a performance. Second being Mr.Scorsese has made a farce out of movie which could have been something else.I once heard a joke that if there was a movie made on Mr.DiCaprio in which the actor playing him had actually won an Oscar for the performance it would be damn hilarious as Mr.DiCaprio can never earn one himself. This joke i think struck Mr.DiCaprio rather hard, as you can see the desperation in his performance in this movie. Of course he has delivered many a memorable performances in ""Inception"", ""The Beach"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". This movie is different, it is different for him very much as never has he been so bang on in creating a riotous comic scene with the true conviction of a actor. Some scenes in this movie have been written for Mr.DiCaprio and he fits into the shoes like a veteran with such ease that it amazes you.Mr.Hill complements him very well as the awkward homo erotic klutz who is a steadfast friend. The pleasant surprise was Mr. Kyle Chandler with a determined and charismatic role. Mr.McConaughey in a brief but important role was a added asset to the cast. Miss Margot Robbie was ever so gorgeous as all the leading ladies in Mr.Scorsese movies are.Mr.Scorsese has been strong in weaving tales which grip you like a ""f**king"" iron vice, he hasn't faltered in this one too. Who am i to be even be able to review the great Mr.Scorsese but all i can say is ""tut tut"", as this movie could have been made into classic but it seems to have been settled down for a entertaining farce of urban gimmicks like drugs, stupid men who swear a lot and lot of ""A"" rated scenes.Kudos to Mr.Terence Winter for writing a entertaining script with such plot points which you can expect before hand yet can't help but admire. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is crisp yet rich.Nevertheless some scenes hit you like a concrete wall and you cannot help but cringe at the crudity of life as it is shoved onto your face."
MrsHenry,"Mar 1, 2015",1/10,"This is a terrible film: simply 3 hours of shouting. It's repetitive; lacking in narrative or plot; no drama; no character development; no wit; no light and shade; no insights - in short nothing at all to recommend it. It's true that DiCaprio gives a good performance, but the totality of the film is so bad it's not worth watching just to see him. The great puzzle is how director Martin Scorsese with his track record could come up with this rubbish? The fact that it gets good reviews just confirms to me that people get dazzled by star names and directors, and lose their sense of judgement. I can't see any other explanation for an 8.2 IMDb rating."
bobbobwhite,"Dec 26, 2013",N/A,"Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort's firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era's greed-is-good WS slicksters.But, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort's oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.It was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era."
erickluca,"Aug 20, 2021",9/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street is an incredible movie, the character is very characteristic, but the movie has several pornographic scenes, making it impossible to watch with family."
dipeshjangir,"Apr 3, 2017",10/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives."

mwatt89,"Jan 20, 2014",8/10,"I have been using IMDb for years & have never posted a review but after seeing TWoWS I felt I needed to finally enter the domain of amateur critics.I've always been a fan of Scorsese's since I was young, some of most memorable cinematic moments come from his earlier works but for me, when he teams with Di Caprio, it's a match made in the highest reaches of movie-making heaven. 'The Departed' is undoubtedly one of the best crime thriller's to ever hit theater's with outstanding performances from multiple cast members but 'The Aviator' was the role that took Di Caprio to that next level, Scorsese provided him the stage to perform and carry the movie to what I feel will go down as one of the greatest artistic portrayals on film.Everyone did not share my love for 'Aviator' but it looks to be a different story altogether with TWoWS with the film already receiving fantastic reviews and praise despite the controversy about the extraordinary excess portrayed. For those who haven't seen it and are sitting on the fence due to the criticism remember one thing, this is a Scorsese movie and you are almost always certain to be a part of a truly visceral experience, Scorsese is used to pushing the boundaries of what is usually acceptable to a mainstream audience and this is no different.At 3 hours the film never feels overdrawn, the characters are fantastically written (which is attributed to Terrance Winter's screenplay) and some truly memorable performances (Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughy are both excellent) but it is Leonardo Di Caprio's execution of one of the most sincere slime balls ever portrayed on film that you MUST watch this film for.The best achievement I attribute to it is that without him, for this movie to be ANY BIT as good as it has turned out, you would only be looking at a very select few actors in the business.Will he finally get an Oscar? That remains to be seen.."
david-meldrum,"Jun 4, 2022",7/10,"An accusation that can be convincingly levelled at Scorsese, especially in his weaker moments, is that he wants to have his cake and eat it. Is he celebrating, lampooning, or critiquing alpha masculinity... or is he doing some combination of all three? In the later part of his career this film is the prime example of that - I'm never quite sure where he lands, and I don't think he truly is either. There's some brilliant performances; and one scene between Margot Robbie and DiCaprio towards the end is genuinely upsetting. But the relentless, frenetic pace of much of the previous three hours does seem to dwarf that; not to mention what comes after it. Three hours of that pace of editing and that volume of sound is just too much; and there seems to be a bit too much comedic enjoyment gained from morally reprehensible behaviour to convince the film is sufficiently nuanced. Not to say there isn't plenty to admire and enjoy - but by Scorsese's standards this leaves the wrong kind of taste in the mouth."

Some are saying ""this is Marty at his best."" God help us to envision there might be 2 or more levels of ""worse."" Ramping up every aspect visually - more vulgarity, more graphic mindless sex, more uncontrolled random depravity without a sense of conscience - sorry, it doesnt add up to ""more is better."" Its like watching a group of ""adults"" who were locked in a cage at age three for 20 years with no healthy socialization, who were then suddenly released upon society. It merely leads to relentless doses of repulsive excess that leaves you more than exhausted long before its concluding scenes.Really, if you want to be drained of the last drips of hope for your kids, grand kids, and every future generation beyond, embrace the Belfart express. He's everything wrong with society wrapped messily in one package. Still no doubt the book deals, speaking engagements, etc, have rolled in since his prison released, because we love rewarding our depraved.Congrats, Marty, it wasnt an easy task, but you've managed to take top honors for the most insipid film, devoid of substance, ever viewed by this reviewer. No amount of a visually enchanting Margot Robbie was ever going to save this one. Now excuse me while I try to discover a way to flush it entirely from memory."
msfindlay,"Dec 25, 2013",N/A,"I found this movie to be tedious, boring and not all that well made. This nearly 3 hour movie should be CUT to about two hours. Things drag on without much of a conclusion. The characters are poorly cast (what does Jonah Hill bring to his role?) with no chemistry or spark to justify their success or motivation.Even the sex scenes and frequent nudity got boring {I can't believe I even said that!). The drug orgies are way too frequent and way too long.Leonardo is a good actor, but not a very compelling character here. He's not that believable as a salesman or druggy. Martin needs to hire an editor who has the courage to CUT, CUT, CUT and tell a story succinctly as possible. Overall, not a very satisfying movie to enjoy on Christmas day."
robertreviewsfilms,"Aug 26, 2021",8/10,Had to re-watch this. Wild and explicit scenes but overall a well made film.
sohansurag,"Apr 19, 2014",9/10,"Ever had the urge to drive fast after watching a Fast & Furious movie? If you are on the page as me, then beware, The Wolf of Wall Street might make you wanna jump start a career in investment. It is exactly what the protagonist Jordan Belfort motivated his accomplices to do in it. There is always something that you could (not proudly) relate to in a Scorsese movie and in The Wolf of Wall Street its about money and who wouldn't love to relate to it.The Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise of Jordan Belfort, a man with high ambitions and even higher exuberance, how he conquers the stock market, goes over the top and more. This could be considered a rags to riches story and the narrative takes a turn after the second act when the riches phase goes a notch above and becomes greed, power and eventually an inevitable descent. When you are this far down the rabbit hole there ain't no coming back to the surface, unscathed at least. A movie with excessive nudity, sleaze and drug use, The Wolf of Wall Street is exactly how its meant to be and Martin Scorsese has done a job which takes its justified crown at the box office and most likely even at the Oscars. One of the strong points of the movie is humor and Wolf of Wall Street packs it in tons. This is by far Scorsese's funniest movie till date that I developed a cramp in my stomach laughing so much.The Wolf of Wall Street is about 3 hours long and not once did I feel an impatient bladder, I was rooted to the seat eager to know where Jordan was going with it. Agreed Jordan Belfort is not guy you'd want your kids looking up to and his ways are never strictly speaking legal. But despite that you want this guy to emerge at the top for his ambitions, this character is as fun as it can get and who brought life to Jordan? Leonardo Di Caprio of course! This is maybe his 6th collab with Martin Scorsese and you have to owe it to them, they do make a dynamic duo. Leonardo despite his charismatic and magnetic performance in his recent movies never landed him an Academy Award but who cares? He has proved that he is one of the greatest actors of our times who literally steals every scene he's in. For once I wanted to step back from the cosmetic layer of Jordan's pompous life and have a different angle at his ways. But Leonardo Di Caprio's performance was just so captivating and he just didn't give me a chance, there was no stepping back when you have delved this much into being entertained.A stellar supporting cast promises that the screen is always filled with intriguing characters. Jonah Hill especially is a force to reckon with as Jordan's most trusted Donnie. This guy has become the go to guy for brilliant supporting roles and is getting increasingly entertaining, starring in almost all of the Academy Award nominated movies. This is indeed a boy's club where there's little importance for feminine characters and I felt the their roles in the movie were objectified. Of course it'd be Pan Am's Margot Robbie's nude scenes that'd be the talk of the day after watching this movie and it is indeed hard to take your eyes off her but you have to admit it takes a splendid performance to be noticed when you've got a star studded male cast to compete with. Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal equally deserves a thumbs up for their short but memorable roles.Its impossible to deduce how Martin Scorsese had done it. The man's edging over his 70s and has crafted a movie so modern, so energetic and with so much passion that even a younger director would be challenged to top it. I really don't care how he is being criticised for his apparent sleazy glorification of the stockbrokers or for the 506 F-bombs thats been dropped in the whole movie. He just delivered another masterpiece, an edge of the seat dramedy that is on par with most of the his as well as others' best movies ever. I enjoyed every frame of it and was left wanting more. Relentlessly funny, loud & ceaselessly crazy, The Wolf of Wall Street in undeniably one of the best movies of 2013 and is by far the best time I had at the movies in recent times."
tomgillespie2002,"Jan 19, 2014",8/10,"Boasting the fifth collaboration between lauded director Martin Scorsese and can-do-no-wrong A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street signals the moment the two finally took the step over the brink. Their previous films together - Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) - were all solid, if hardly groundbreaking works. With The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese seems to have let go of his reservations and embraced the daring, X- rated innovations of his 70's and early 80's work, and DiCaprio deserves to look smug after giving his finest performance to date. From the opening shot of DiCaprio snorting cocaine from between a prostitute's open legs, this is 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.Shortly after being taught the ways of excess and cocaine by his Wall Street boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), young stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) finds himself out of work following Black Monday. When he takes a boiler room job at a stockbroker's dealing in penny stocks, he learns that commission for these stocks are 50%. Soon enough he is making money hand over fist, setting up his own company, Stratton Oakmont, along with his dentally-challenged follower Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He recruits some of Donnie's marijuana-dealing friends and teaches them a script designed to sell, but ultimately the operation is a pump and dump scam. He is labelled The Wolf of Wall Street in a negative magazine article, yet this propels him to cult fame, and soon has flocks of eager young Gordon Gekko's begging for a piece of the pie.At one minute shy of 3 hours, the film could certainly do with a trim. Yet Scorsese and DiCaprio's obvious fascination with this anti-hero means that we are treated to experiencing every juvenile and ridiculous second of Belfort's rise to Wall Street superstardom. We get flights with on-board orgies and drug taking, Jonah Hill masturbating in the middle of a crowded party at the sight of Belfort's future wife Naomi (the stunning Margot Robbie), dwarf-tossing, and Belfort taking helicopter lessons whilst drugged off his face. This is certainly dangerous territory - the film could easily slip into a celebration of frat-house antics, which is kind of does, but Scorsese keep the insanity levels at such a height that it's hard not to just laugh and shake your head.A lot of it is down to the performances of DiCaprio and Hill, the latter of whom is proving to be a damn fine actor beneath that Jew-fro and obnoxious mannerisms. The film's highlight focuses on a botched scheme to smuggle $2 million dollars via Brad (Jon Bernthal) to reptilian French banker Jean (Jean Dujardin). Having learned that FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) has his phones tapped, Belfort must get home to warn Donnie to get off the phone. The only problem is, they've taken a large quantity of Qualuudes. Thinking that years of indulgence have caused a tolerance to build up, the expired best before date have simply lead to a delayed reaction. Belfort suffers from what he describes as 'the cerebral palsy stage', flailing around on the floor without control of his limbs or his speech. His long journey home is the most laugh-out- loud example of drug-fuelled ineptitude since the ether scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998).Of course, the film's morals are questionable, and Scorsese has suffered the same narrow-minded criticism he did from his 'glamorisation' of the mob in Goodfellas (1990). Yet I like to think that Scorsese trusts and respects his audience enough to allow them to think for themselves, to get a laugh from the on-screen antics whilst understanding that this is not the behaviour of a sane or ethical individual. Refreshingly, the movie stays away from any moral preaching or underlying messages, and simply tells a story because it's entertaining. Although it doesn't quite justify it's 3 hour running time, this is the most fun I've had watching a comedy for a long time, and proves that there's plenty of life in Scorsese yet.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
rlamybarlow,"Dec 30, 2013",8/10,"Rated R Post... within the first 5 minutes, Leonardo Dicaprio snorts cocaine off a hooker's ass. The rest of the movie is just as excessive. A spectacular orgy of excess: cocaine, Quaalude, materialism and full frontal female nudity. Check your morals and you might have a good time. But DEFINITELY NOT for everyone.Scorcese directs in his usual High NRG style (like ""After Hours"" and ""The Color of Money"", the camera never stops moving.) DiCarpio goes all out with this character, making him human, though not heroic at all. These are awful people doing awful things, and the film might revel too much in that, without showing the consequences of it.A definite GUY film, probably could complement with Pacino and DiPalma's ""Scarface""."
crimsontide12367,"May 20, 2014",10/10,"Why Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win the Oscar for best actor, I will never understand. Matthew McConaughey must have put on an absolutely indescribable performance in Dallas Buyers Club. I have yet to see Dallas Buyers Club, so I can't say Matthew didn't deserve it.The Wolf of Wall Street is insane though! It is a very well directed movie by my favorite director of all time, Martin Scorsese. This movie shows what it was like as a stockbroker in a very unique way as a comedy. However, if it wasn't a comedy, it would be a very boring movie. Well done by the writers.This is definitely my favorite movie of all time now. Even at 3 hours long, I wish the movie continued. I would recommend seeing it, but children should NOT see this movie."
dggeorges_2000,"Jan 7, 2024",6/10,"This was a well-crafted film, but the numerous raunchy scenes ruined it for me. I normally like Scorcese films, so I gave this one a watch.The most annoying thing about this movie was the gratuitous nudity and sex. Completely unnecessary. Yes, I get it that these scenes are supposed to give us a more realistic glimpse into the excesses of the main character's hedonistic lifestyle, but it was just too much.The other annoying thing was the narration. Just not needed.Pros: Amazing direction Acting was over the top, but still goodCons: 3 hours of tedious voice overs Numerous unnecessary raunchy scenes, bordering on soft-core porn."

Leon-55,"Feb 15, 2014",1/10,"This movie is so offensive, so filled with endless drug and sex fueled debauchery, so full of rot, squalor, and porn that I am almost loath to even spend time writing about it. There is virtually no conversation – simply hundreds of expletives that are connected with inconsequential words in a doomed attempt to fake dialog. And drugs-porn.Most of the shallow characters portrayed, show such a gargantuan lack of class that it leaves you breathless. A moneyed common lot that act on virtually every debased animalistic urge that their festered brains can come up with. And everybody is screaming at some point or another – one of noisiest (non-disaster) movies I have ever been tortured with. And drugs- porn. (Drugs are even snorted out of a woman's assh*le. So classy ) After this, what can possibly be the next level Mr Scorsese? Scenes of child rape? I really expected a bit more class from you. But hey, we are all in it for the money hey? It is our right. And it is your right to shove this rubbish down the audience's throat.As true as the sun rises in the morning, this excruciatingly-three-hour-long-stretch of bawdy, very noisy and lewd porn-vomit, can never be called art."

rddj05,"May 28, 2014",9/10,"Wolf of Wall St. is a fascinating film by a master filmmaker, bringing 40 years of skill to the table; from casting, to shot selection, to how he pulls you into that world. And a guy who just plain having fun. The 3-hour film, traces the rise and fall of Wall St con man Jordan Belfort. A tightly constructed film, I wasn't bored for a minute.There were some people who kicked up a fuss about the film and its glorification of these slimy characters, their materialistic lifestyle, and their treatment of women as nothing but sex objects. Some have said that the film glorifies that lifestyle, but to me, Winter (screenwriter) and Scorcese went out of their way to show the reality of it. The film focuses on how animalistic and primal people can become when greed takes them over. The obsession with money and power becomes a pathology. This, of course, is what many Wall St people will loathe about the film.As for accuracy, I'm sure Jordan Belfort (who the film is based on and worked as a consultant on the film), embellished a few things, but according to one of the FBI agents who worked on the case, many of the more outrageous aspects depicted in the book and film were accurate.The sad part is that even though there will will many Wall St workers and finance people who will watch the film and think, ""That's a bunch of crap. They're painting with a broad brush. It's not fair,"" there will be far too many young (and not-so-young) Wall St up-and-comers who will ignore the whole last hour of Wolf of Wall St., and simply look at the first 2 hours as an inspirational tale of the American dream."
mahad-livid-se,"Dec 18, 2014",8/10,"This movie was interesting,educational and at the same time very very funny. Great performance by Leo as expected!! In my opinion this movie was one of Leo less better movies especially when you consider titles such as Blood diamond, Inception, Catch me if you can and last but not least Titanic. Which was a great movie.One of the things that stood out to me the most in this movie was how Leo' character went from a humble, down to earth and loving individual. To a corrupt, self loathing criminal. It really shocked me what money can do to people and how much you can downgrade the people around you.All and all great movie! 8/10."
Pratyush003,"Sep 15, 2023",10/10,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013) is nothing short of a modern cinematic masterpiece, deserving every bit of a perfect 10/10 stars. This film is a relentless, audacious, and electrifying rollercoaster ride that leaves an indelible mark on the world of cinema.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a tour de force performance as Jordan Belfort, the charismatic yet morally bankrupt stockbroker whose rise and fall is the core of this exhilarating narrative. DiCaprio's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing; he immerses himself fully in the character, capturing every facet of Belfort's complex personality. His magnetic presence alone makes this film worth watching.The supporting cast is equally exceptional. Jonah Hill shines as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's unhinged partner in crime, providing a perfect counterbalance to DiCaprio's character. The chemistry between these two actors is palpable, and their on-screen interactions are electrifying. Margot Robbie is a revelation as Naomi Lapaglia, Belfort's seductive and fiery wife, bringing depth and complexity to her character.Scorsese's direction is nothing short of brilliant. He fearlessly dives into the dark and morally bankrupt world of Wall Street excess, portraying it with unflinching honesty and a wicked sense of humor. The film's pacing is relentless, and Scorsese's use of music, especially the iconic ""Gimme Shelter"" sequence, is a testament to his mastery of the craft.Terence Winter's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending humor, drama, and social commentary. The dialogue crackles with wit and satire, and it keeps the audience engaged throughout the film's epic three-hour runtime.Visually, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning, capturing the opulence and decadence of Belfort's world with breathtaking precision. The film's use of practical effects and seamless editing further enhances its visual appeal.What truly sets this film apart is its unapologetic exploration of greed, corruption, and excess. Scorsese holds a mirror to society's obsession with wealth and power, and he does so with razor-sharp wit and intelligence. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a scathing critique of the American Dream gone awry, and it doesn't pull any punches.In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic tour de force that deserves every accolade it has received. It's a wild, exhilarating, and thought-provoking journey that showcases the best of filmmaking talent. With DiCaprio's unforgettable performance, Scorsese's masterful direction, and a screenplay that crackles with brilliance, this film stands as a testament to the power of cinema. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and watch this modern classic. It's a 10/10 star triumph that will leave you both exhilarated and contemplative."
haydenluz,"Jul 7, 2020",10/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street was directed & produced by my favorite director in Martin Scorsese, who's directed popular titles like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, Shutter Island, and my god, the man did it again! By taking authentic source material, while slightly deviating it from the truth, he created this MASTERPIECE, inspired by Jordan Belfort's real story, and his autobiographies.Terrance Winter & Martin Scorsese did a PHENOMENAL job telling this story. The narrative has so many memorable scenes, amd tremendous layers, that holds so much rewatch value! After watching countless videos on the true story, and what the real Jordan Belfort (who was also on set for the production) thought; all of these seemed to be fantasy's, were almost all true, and immaculately presented! According to Belfort, Scorsese & Winter's dumbed things down! Not only was this the best paced out, three hour film I've seen, but probably one of the greatest films I've seen, in general - I was so intrigued from minute one, all the way to minute one-hundred-eighty!The screenplay by Winter's was super creative & and so much fun! He added so many great layers to each character, giving them their own distinct personalities. The script was so vulgar, yet very witty, while still being ridiculously funny.Even though Martin Scorsese & Terrace Winter's flipped some of the names, and some being made up completely, due to secrecy reasons, this A-list cast had such inspiring charisma, and displayed all the real actions, tremendously! I have seen A LOT of films, and more than a few Dicaprio films, but this was hands down the best acting I've seen across a cast, but giving tremendous credit to Leonardo DiCaprio, who got snubbed for an Academy Award for his performance! His anti-hero swagger, with such an engrossing personality, brought an abundance of charm, wit, and tons of comedy to this film. His love life was also nailed to a T! Margot Robbie's character development in the third act compliments the tone it was going for. The way Scorsese displays their relationship was pretty accurate, almost all the way down the line. Dan Porush, named Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill, is Jordan's second in command. Jonah Hill put on a FANTASTIC performance; definitely my favorite performance of his. I also thought Jonah Hill was snubbed for an Academy Award. Jonah Hill embodied Dan Porush to a T, down to his wife, his ambitions attitude, and everything else around it. As far as the strattonites go, in Henry Zebrowski, Kenneth Choi, Brian Sacca, Jon Bernthal & P.J Byne, they had the most chaotic roles out of everyone, on the side of Leo. Every character knew their role, and played it to perfection. I loved Rob Reiner in this film, even though he wasn't that important. His crazy dad attitude was displayed clear as crystal, and was an overall great addition! Matthew McConaughey had another small, but important role in Jordan Belfort's character development. After doing further research, McConaughey had a lot more of an impact than his screen time allowed. One of my favorite additions to this film, was Bo Dietl, playing Belfort's PI. Bo Dietl was the actual PI of the real Jordan Belfort. His character was just another small, but necessary addition, with such an effortless performance, due to Dietl playing himself.The editing by probably one of the most credible editors in the game, in Thelma Shoonmaker, who edited all of Scorsese's films, had a tough task at hand. This film was 3 hours long, so I can only imagine how many deleted scenes there were, and what the run-time would've actually been, without so many cuts, and mashes. Shoonmaker did make some scenes a little obvious that they were two scenes mashed together, or shot at different times, but it's hard to fault someone with that much on their plate, with that much of a hefty resumé.Overall, this is in my top five FAVORITE films of all time, and I HIGHLY recommend this film. Another film you MUST see before you die."
rajatdhameja,"May 29, 2014",9/10,"Leonardo DiCaprio is such a Brilliant actor. Everyone in this movie performed nothing short of excellence. Martin Scorsese has done wonderful work in this movie as in all his others, in bringing out the best in all characters. I have watched several movies that have won accolades for various performances. At the very least,The Wold of Wall Street is as remarkable as other great works. I watched the movie on blue-ray but wish the experience in the the theater would have taken the experience to a new level. Prior to watching the movie, I watched the trailer and read about the plot which provide a glimpse only. Watching this movie has been gripping, enthralling, captivating and a good learning experience."
hkauteur,"Jan 26, 2014",7/10,"Martin Scorsese's latest is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker and founder of Stratton Oakmont, a company which engaged in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street during the nineties.First off, the performances are top-notch. Leonardo DiCaprio has managed to find new depths by playing a character that is even debatably worse than the racist plantation owner in Django Unchained. DiCaprio has done more than enough to win his Oscar, and winning for The Wolf of Wall Street is as good any of his other roles. My favorite DiCaprio performance is still Howard Hughes in The Aviator. Though my vote goes to McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club this year. Speaking of which, McConaughey has a great cameo as Jordan's mentor, who gives Belfort the inspirational push. However, Jonah Hill is the standout as Belfort's psychotic sidekick Donnie Azoff, delivering an even more impressive performance than in Moneyball.At a 3-hour running time, the film is too long and it easily could have been shorter with less party scenes and throwing midgets into giant dartboards at the office. As a rise-and-fall story, it has too much 'rise' and not enough 'fall'. I wanted the story to move on and inform us about the financial damage this all caused and all the lives it hurt in the process, but Scorsese does not seem interested in the forensics. Overall there are some very good party set pieces and funny scenes, but after a while, I was just numb.The story is essentially told from the villain's point of view. Extending this idea to the classic children's storybook The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, which is told from the Big Bad Wolf's perspective. The Wolf retells the Three Little Pigs story and asks the reader to consider his side of the story. The Wolf was simply trying to bake a cake for his grandmother's birthday while nursing a bad cold, and things got out of hand. Therein lies my criticism: there is nothing redeemable from the Jordan Belfort character in The Wolf of Wall Street. Or at the very least, the filmmakers do not seem interested in showing anything beyond the surface.The breaking-the-4th-wall story device of having the villain narrate his story to the audience is raunchy and creative, but Scorsese totally forgets that it is supposed to be ironical. The premise of the black comedy is that we're supposed to laugh at how vile and putrid these people are. But by the nth orgy scene, the characters are matted into two dimensions and we never get beneath the surface. The morality play tips over to the other side and it mistakenly justifies itself. Just because this a tale about self-indulgent shallow people doesn't mean we have to tell their story in a self-indulgent shallow fashion.The bad taste left in my mouth at the end is not the film's self-indulgence, but out of worry that The Wolf of Wall Street is so unclear about its cautionary message, that there are certain viewers that will admire this lifestyle and become inspired to become a stock broker. For the rest of that find the Belfort character repugnant will feel empty wondering what justified the three-hour running time.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
juulgroenen,"Nov 12, 2021",10/10,"This movie has everything a guy likes. I watched it over 10 times I guess. Enjoy the acting, from both Leo and Jonah. It's a shame they didn't receive an Oscar. And yes I watched Dallas Buyers Club too, but this is too good."
CanSteve3,"Jan 12, 2014",7/10,"It's comforting to imagine that everything Martin Scorsese touches turns to gold, but it's not true. The same rules of thoroughness that apply to every other filmmaker also apply to Scorsese. If he rushes through a compressed editing schedule to meet an Oscar-friendly release date – as he did on The Wolf of Wall Street – his work suffers. Scorsese's latest clocks in at 180 minutes, not because its characters or narrative demand that kind of exhaustive treatment, but because Scorsese didn't have time to find a more focused, impactful shape for the film. Exploring the personal and professional corruption of notorious stockbroker Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street has several memorable sequences, but it plays like a clumsy, repetitive work-in-progress.Praise has already been heaped upon Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill for their charismatic performances, but it's important to note that this is wacky comic acting more concerned with eliciting shock and amusement than any deeper human truth. This miscalculation of emphasis also infects the storytelling in a more general sense. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter focus nearly all of their attention on the excesses – sex, drugs, greed – that drive these characters, rarely placing them in a context that might reveal complicating texture or shading. It's perfectly logical to portray these characters as one-note imbeciles with an absence of inner life, but this also makes for stifling, unsatisfying drama.The Wolf of Wall Street never finds its bearings, but it becomes more tolerable in its second half when Belfort finally encounters some resistance (in the form of FBI agent Patrick Denham, played by Kyle Chandler) and sees his warped life of excess start to unravel. But even then, the film is dragged down by its reliance on Belfort's moronic perspective – the film is derived from his self-mythologizing memoir – which gives an Animal House frivolity to his constant misbehaviour, a smokescreen that distracts from the devastation of his professional crimes.Simply recycling sensibilities from Goodfellas and The Departed may seem like a logical strategy, but there's a crucial difference this time around. Whereas gangsters generally do harm to other gangsters, Belfort's victims are relatively innocent, draining this film's lawlessness of charm and fascination. Scorsese's ability to find humanity in reprehensible characters has always been one of his greatest strengths, but he doesn't even attempt to humanize the characters in The Wolf of Wall Street. This wilful oversight results in one of the director's most disposable, nihilistic films, a half-hearted effort that abandons the complexities of his own world view in favour of Belfort's clueless primitivism. This might have made for a uniquely compelling Todd Phillips (The Hangover) movie, but in the hands of Scorsese, this mildly entertaining diversion feels hopelessly erratic and insubstantial."
littlane,"Jan 11, 2021",1/10,"I never understood why it's highly rated in comparison to other films that are much more interesting. I was super excited to watch Wolf of Wall Street so you can imagine the disappointment when I watched the film and dialogue that was becoming even slightly interesting, was overrun with vulgarity.

foehrenbach,"Nov 11, 2021",10/10,"I saw nearly all of the top ranking movies on IMDB and I love a lot of them, but this one is my favorite. Although this is a drama and not a comedy this is the funniest movie that I have ever seen. The lines and how they are beeing portrayed just makes you smile for the whole movie. The acting and the wiriting are brilliant and although it is pretty long the pacing is never too fast or slow. Even after watching it five times it still just gets better every single time.By the way Leo was great but Jonah Hill gets underappreciated."

chiragrathod09,"Jul 19, 2024",8/10,"Martin Scorsese's *The Wolf of Wall Street* is an audacious exploration of ambition, decadence, and the morally bankrupt world of finance. Released in 2013, this cinematic rollercoaster invites viewers into the high-stakes life of Jordan Belfort, portrayed exuberantly by Leonardo DiCaprio, whose rise and fall mirror the excesses of a bygone era where greed was not just good, but glorified.From the very first scene, where Belfort introduces us to his whirlwind lifestyle, Scorsese deftly immerses us in a world of outrageous opulence and reckless abandon. This film is not merely about the financial markets; it's a vibrant tapestry woven with themes of ambition, desire, and the consequences of unchecked hedonism. The frenetic energy of the film, accentuated by its rapid-fire editing and dynamic cinematography, thrusts viewers into the frenetic pulse of Wall Street, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye.DiCaprio's performance is nothing short of iconic, melding charm and cunning to create a character who captivates and repulses in equal measure. Belfort's magnetic personality is enhanced by a fantastic supporting cast, including Jonah Hill as the outrageous Donnie Azoff, who perfectly embodies the absurdity of their lavish lifestyle. Their escapades, from drug-fueled parties to lavish yacht escapades, are portrayed in a way that is both humorous and horrifying, forcing the audience to confront the stark reality behind the glitz.What stands out in *The Wolf of Wall Street* is its unapologetic approach to storytelling. Scorsese does not shy away from the darker aspects of Belfort's life; rather, he embraces them with a tongue-in-cheek bravado. The result is a film that oscillates between riotous comedy and a sobering reflection on moral decay. Despite the chaos and laugh-out-loud moments, there lies an underlying critique of capitalism that resonates in today's society. Scorsese expertly crafts a narrative that leaves viewers questioning the true cost of success and the emptiness that often accompanies it.Visually stunning and audibly exhilarating, the film is punctuated by a soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the era's hedonism, with classic tracks underscoring the characters' relentless pursuit of pleasure. The vibrant cinematography captures the lavish settings-a grandiose office, extravagant parties, and opulent homes-painting a picture of a world where the excess is both intoxicating and toxic.*The Wolf of Wall Street* transcends the traditional biopic, offering a frenetic portrayal of a man who embodies the spirit of excess in contemporary society. It is a story of illusion and reality, ambition and consequence, wrapped in a package of humor and extravagance. As the credits roll, viewers are left with an unsettling reflection on the seductive nature of wealth and the inevitable pitfalls that await those who chase it without regard for morality. Scorsese reminds us that while the wolf may howl at the moon, the sobering consequences of its predatory nature remain ever-present, casting a long shadow over the allure of excess."
Bored_Dragon,"May 30, 2022",7/10,"Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is based on the autobiography of Jordan Belfort, who, using loopholes in the law, created a multimillion-dollar brokerage empire out of nothing, lived the 'American dream' and ended up in prison.""My name is Jordan Belfort. I'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens. The year I turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, I made $49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.""The film was flawlessly shot (nominations for best film and directing) and, although it lasts for three hours, it is not boring for a moment, and for the most part it is even very entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio excelled in the lead role, but, as usual, remained only on the Oscar nomination. He is supported by Jonah Hill (also an Oscar nominee), Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, and many other not-so-famous, but no less good actors.If you are looking for a dramatic but humorous portrayal of life on a high but shaky leg, a newly rich man who lives fast in crazy sex, drugs, and more drugs manner, you are in the right place. To gain some idea of the explicitness and decadence in the film, it is interesting to note that DiCaprio once cited the Tinto Brass' ""Caligula"" (1979) as an inspiration and role model for making this movie.""Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man. And I choose rich every time. Because, at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of the limo, wearing a $2000 suit and a $40,000 gold watch.""But, although this story has some indication of social criticism and the potential for a deeper and more serious film, it still remains in the domain of a typical American blockbuster, without much substance and point.7,5/10."
kymokeefe,"Sep 6, 2020",10/10,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. The acting is phenomenal; Leonardo DiCaprio is without a doubt the best actor of our timeShocking, funny - I've never been more entertained watching a film in my life."
mchl88,"Jan 21, 2024",6/10,"I was really interested to see Wolf of Wall Street, not just because its Scorsese and it's gotten so many nominations but also I cant remember a movie that my friends on Facebook have given such differing reviews to. I've read everything from Wow great movie! To What a waste of time. And I have to say, after seeing it yesterday, I come down pretty squarely in the middle. It was good. It was funny (in parts) It was drawn out (in parts). It was entertaining. But I don't think it's anywhere near the best movie of the year in fact I can think of a few movies that weren't even nominated (42 for example) that I thought were better overall movies.I kept feeling like I was watching Goodfellas but with Wall Street Greed as the driving force instead of Mafia Greed. Scorsese isn't the first film maker or writer to do this. You have a successful template of a story, you change some of the mitigating factors and voila! You have a new movie. Michael Crichton did the same thing with Jurassic Park. Go back and watch Westworld and it's pretty much the same movie (adult theme park where the attractions get out of control) with robots exchanged for genetically recreated dinosaurs. So I'm not knocking Scorsese but I will say this, Wolf is no Goodfellas. None of these characters rang as true to me as Henry Hill or Tommy and Jimmy.And that's the challenge with a movie like this. We have to like the villains. We have to pull for Tony Soprano or Henry Hill or Jordan Belfort because at the end of the day MOST people abhor that type of behavior so how you can you watch a movie like this and not want the protagonist to go down in flames? Answer: if somehow, against all logic and odds, we've fallen in love with them. And I don't think Scorsese did enough to make me love (or even like) Belfort and Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and the rest.That's what the comedic scenes are for in these movies. When Joe Pesci does his classic, ""I'm funny? I'm here to amuse you?"" rant we want to be at that table. We want to be in that group because they are funny and cool and squeezing every last moment of joy from life. And that's what moments like the midget tossing are supposed to do for us in Wolf and like I said, I laughed at some of these (yes I laughed at the midget tossing, sorry) but overall, my mind never left the fact that
these guys were getting rich by taking innocent, hard working people's money and putting them into worthless investments. And when I say ""taking"" I get the fact that they were ""selling"" and not stealing and I think some people who love this movie see it as that: a triumph of master selling, another ""Boiler Room"" or ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" where the silver tongued ultimate salesmen proves he's superman and can do anything, but quite frankly if you lie and deceive to sell, I don't consider that selling. I consider it lying and deceiving. And I'd just as soon have you throw a brick threw my window or torch my store 'cause then at least I know who you are. So in the end, I never did fall in love with Belfort and his quaaludes and hookers enough to not want him to get busted (like I do when the helicopters are chasing Henry Hill)Scale of 1-10 I'd give Wolf a 6. Entertaining movie with funny moments. Coulda been a half hour shorter. And no way, IMO is it Best Movie of the year."
SteveMierzejewski,"Jan 11, 2014",3/10,"If you don't like what you see within the first 15 minutes of this film, turn it off or leave the theater, because that's what you will see repeated over and over again for the next three hours. Okay, I get it. There are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. This is Hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by one-click-accessible porn. I'm not a puritan. This is just an objective fact. We live in the Age of Pornography. I, therefore, don't understand why Scorsese thinks this is the 'shocking' lens he should use to educate us on the evils of Wall Street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. In the end, I felt that it was Scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. I think it is time for him to reassess his career. No great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. Great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. This does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. The knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. But there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. Even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat.Now, what about the acting? There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor. However, I haven't been impressed by many of his recent efforts (i.e. Gatsby). In this film his character is one dimensional from beginning to end. There is no character development and no real opportunities for him to show his acting range. The same can be said for all the other actors, but given such an insipid script, what can you expect? After a couple of hours of watching Scorsese trying to educate us on the evils of wealth, I just wanted the film to end. He seemed to have an ax to grind in the tradition of other ax-grinders like Michael Moore and Oliver Stone. The last hour was simply an ordeal. Scenes seemed randomly cut and pasted together. Although I can't say there were not some interesting scenes within the film, they only served as sad reminders of Scorsese's wasted talent.It makes no sense at all to me why this film is rated so highly. Maybe there are a number of people who were surprised to learn that excessive wealth can lead to bad behavior. All I learned is to be careful of giving too much credence to the ratings of any Scorsese film."

The constant depravity, the use of drug scenes where those taken would have killed a real person and boring meaningless sex scenes. I guess someone forgot the word Edit. Di caprio made himself a star idiot. I cared nothing about the characters my first requirement for any drama. no matter what. Using the f-bomb hundreds of times was disgusting and no substitute for good writing. The only reason I went was the Directors career of great movies and this one was so bad it almost destroyed his reputation or at least damaged it seriously. He should be ashamed of himself got putting out his vile disgusting film. Total garbage!!"
kevin_robbins,"Oct 3, 2023",10/10,"I recently watched The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) on Prime. The storyline follows a young man in New York who excels at day trading and quickly rises through the ranks to amass great wealth, eventually starting his own company. As he becomes more affluent and successful, he draws the government's attention for his activities. Can he elude the long arm of the law, or will they bring about his downfall?Directed by the iconic Martin Scorsese (Casino) and featuring stellar performances from a talented cast including Leonardo DiCaprio (Django), Jonah Hill (Superbad), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Matthew McConaughey (Killer Joe), Shea Whigham (Splinter), Kyle Chandler (Super 8) and Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead).This film boasts an outstanding cast, mesmerizing performances, sharp dialogue, superb narration, and features beautiful women throughout, alongside unbelievable circumstances that capture the viewer's imagination. Every scene within the office setting is mind-blowing, making you yearn to be part of that extravagant lifestyle. While the ending may be somewhat predictable, as all good things must eventually come to an end, especially illegal ones, DiCaprio and Hill's dynamic chemistry shines through. The supporting roles played by Robbie and Chandler are executed flawlessly, and the cameo by the actual Wolf of Wall Street at the end adds an intriguing touch.In conclusion, The Wolf of Wall Street stands as another masterpiece by Scorsese and DiCaprio and is an absolute must-see. I would give this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."

excavator,"Jun 3, 2014",8/10,"I've always been a fan of Martin Scorcese's work. He's had great cooperations with Leonardo Dicaprio before, so for me, this was a must see. However, I have some mixed feelings about the result.On the upside I thought the level of acting was great. I have always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's work, and, even though I didn't feel that much sympathy for his character, he portrayed Jordan Belfort beautifully. Jonah Hill did a solid job as well, and I liked the absolutely gorgeous Margot Robbie very much (and not just because she didn't leave much to the imagination). As you can expect from Martin Scorcese, the movie is very well made, the photography was great, and the music supported the scenes very well. As far as atmosphere goes, you could really feel the madness. And last but not least, I was happy there was room for some humor.On the downside, I felt it was a very superficial portrait. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how close the storytelling of the movie is to the book, but at times the movie felt like a giant collection of moments out of Jordan Belfort's life, rather than the story of his life. Even though the movie lasts for three hours, there's little or no room for character development. The focus was also continuously on Jordan himself and his side of the story. For example the whole fraud aspect was shown as his big success. There was no room for his victims in the movie. The investigation by the FBI was also rather non existing, as is his relationship with Naomi. After he gets to know her and marries her, she almost completely disappears to the background.In conclusion, it's a good movie, with a powerful portrayal of Jordan Belfort, for which I'm still giving an 8/10. However, the story could have been told better, making it more of a story, allowing characters to develop and showing more than just one side of it."
akash_sebastian,"Jan 10, 2014",7/10,"Scorsese and DiCaprio's fifth venture together, this might be their most mainstream attempt till now. This black-hearted comedy, filled with colour, glamour, parties, money, corruption, drugs and sex, oozes of energy throughout it's three-hour long run-time. I admit it's a fun-filled ride throughout, and it never gets boring. But after a certain point, the narration, the jokes and the parties get monotonous. For such a long movie, the character-development and character-exploration is very poor, and there are so many characters and scenes which don't have any special relevance or importance in the whole story being told. I can't believe it's Terence Winter (from 'The Sopranos' and 'Boardwalk Empire') who wrote the script. The main distraction while watching a biopic like this is that the things shown on screen (fabulous office parties, amount of drugs each of the them take within a day, their ability to function properly in such high, the money lavishly spent around, and so many other things) always make you wonder how much of it is accurate and how much of it is complete exaggeration; you don't get a clear picture of the people and lifestyle of that place and era.But whatever you say, with whatever is given to him, Leonardo audaciously gets into the skin of the character and is fascinating to watch. Moira MacDonald from Seattle Times aptly says, ""DiCaprio is positively reptilian; he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. You're both horrified and enchanted by this creature - a monster in Armani"". And Jonah Hill is almost as integral to the movie as DiCaprio himself; he's hilariously terrific from beginning till end.I like that the movie doesn't shy away from being filthy. Plus Scorsese's depiction of a modern tragedy as an epic farce works to its advantage. Looks like Scorsese was in quite a fun mood or pretty high (like the movie's characters) while making this. Though it's a hysterical and thoroughly-entertaining journey, I still don't understand why Scorsese and DiCaprio jumped into making this completely exaggerated alleged life of a convicted swindler. Anyway, the feature is good not great. With a little more depth, the movie could have been timeless."
frog1385,"May 31, 2014",1/10,"What does a film have to do to get an X rating these days? Full frontal female nudity, simulated sex, every vulgar word in the book, drug addiction. If you can get by all that, you are left with a tedious tale that goes on for three hours with one excess after another. Scorsese has never been noted for restraint, but he should be ashamed of this film. The Academy should go back to five Best Picture nominations to avoid letting an abomination like this get nominated.And, finally, dropping an F-bomb has become commonplace in today's films, but this one is the undisputed world champion for total number and frequency of them."

fredberglyle,"Mar 26, 2014",8/10,"The movie breaks the record for number of f-words (506 in number). So true you can expect for a Scorsese's movie. Leonard gives the best performance in his career. Matt Mc and Dujardin are brief and are superb. Jonah Hill was very good. This 3 hour movie is filled with so much energy and comedy dialogs (of course with profanity). As other Scorsese's films, there is a whole lot of description on drugs. There were three major comedy scenes that were hilarious. Few others were forced.Pros : Strong acting, direction and screenplay. Cons : Too much xxx orgy, excessive drugs and profanity. Some bad humor.In short, the movie is recommended for fans of Scorsese. For others: don't waste your time on this!!"
ArtandJoyofMovies,"Jan 11, 2014",6/10,"A TMG rating of 6.0 is being generous with an emphasis on this movie could have, and should have, been a whole lot better. How? Listen to an editor and cut about 1.3 hours of pure crap and meaningless scenes from the film. Tossing a pile of hundred dollar bills on top of naked women is funny and outrageous once, but unless you are the guy getting to do it, it is one and done. After twenty scenes of butt, booze and debauchery on film, you pretty much start thinking of just a good beer, a brat and reading the Wall Street Journal.This film was Wall Street (1987) on Geckko steroids and quaaludes. It was less about the corruption or inner workings of Wall Street and much more just about unbridled Hedonism. It was a more The Hangover Part III (2013) outtakes meets Catch me if You Can (2002). Basically, it was a cheap film with bad writing, marginal acting with lots of cash, drugs and T & A---not meaning tax and accounting.The only real bright spot was the always fun and ingenious acting of Matthew McConaughey. His role was priceless, but all too short.This mostly misguided attempt to make an epic was as badly executed as DiCaprio and Scorsese's effort in Gangs of New York (2002)---a film that made my pet squirrel fall asleep on a pile of acorns. If you have not seen this film yet, skip it. Go home. Have a quaalude yourself. Pull out a Penthouse magazine and throw some dollar bills in the air. You will pretty much get the same experience. And if not overly obvious, don't take your kids or Mom to this one."

PippinInOz,"Feb 1, 2015",1/10,"I have just switched off The Wolf of Wall Street in.....well, shock frankly. After persevering for quite some time, because this is a film directed by Martin Scorcese for goodness sake! So felt it just had to get better any minute NOW.Unfortunately, it did not. Flabby and self indulgent. This required an excellent editor to step up and shout over the ego's: 'No really fellas......that just goes on and on and on.....keep it sharp!' Just shocked at how appalling this actually is. If this was a couple of guys just out of film school, would the critics have raved about it? Would it get nominated for Awards?More evidence of the ridiculousness of big award nights.I have read the reviews here of people who liked this film, and all respect to you. Everything is perception is it not? Where they see 'innovation' I see self indulgence and lack of editorial discipline. See what you think."
Bunuel1976,"Mar 2, 2014",N/A,"Considering its many affiliations with American HUSTLE (noted in that film's review), it is interesting to watch how in the former, the F.B.I. emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably well-meaning approach – while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success! Anyway, much has been said of this latest Martin Scorsese/Leonardo Di Caprio collaboration – especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration (with some of the admittedly over-the-top sex'n'drugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even ""Euro-Cult"" movie from the 1970s!). Still, I feel this backlash (especially for the way such serious offenses as depicted in the film are treated in blackly comic terms) was itself extreme: just note how much attention has been given to the dwarf-throwing gag (the pros and cons of such a wild scheme are amusingly delineated just like any other business-related item!) but, seeing how it occurs during the very opening scene, one would expect the viewer to have totally worked it out of his system by the time the picture's end credits start rolling! Indeed, to Scorsese's credit, if the Jordan Belfort gang's scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly – or, should I say, the rewards they reaped from it – these characters' fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular; so, in that respect, it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which, like it or not, existsand to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it!As for Di Caprio, his performance is indeed among the year's best and one of his own towering achievements – but, personally, I feel he was even better in THE AVIATOR (2004) and SHUTTER ISLAND (2010; for which he was not even Oscar-nominated!), both also for Scorsese. The film under review is up for just five Academy Awards, which rather shuts it out from winning any of the top categories – unless the AMPAS voters prefer the star to Matthew McConaughey in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (another initially reprehensible real-life character dealing in illegal substances but, in his case, for the common good rather than self-gratification), which I sincerely doubt!; incidentally, McConaughey himself turns up here early on as the anti-hero's mentor and whose ritualistic hum to get him functioning on a daily basis is even worked into a song by the actor and the film's music director Robbie Robertson (ex-member of The Band and a Scorsese regular)!Jonah Hill as the protagonist's sidekick is also shortlisted in the Supporting Actor category but, while his contribution is highly entertaining, there is little depth to the part (even less so where their other colleagues are concerned, who somehow seem stuck in the lower rungs of the firm despite its obvious flourish!). Di Caprio's role – being based on the book written by Belfort himself – is clearly much more rounded, then, especially since his intermittent narration is adamant that money and power (even more so when acquired at a young age and unlawfully) too often lead one on a self-destructive pathand the fact that he was able to rise again after 'doing time' is a testament to his talent for survival, if nothing else! To go back to its ties with American HUSTLE, the F.B.I. sequences necessarily recall those of Scorsese's earlier and superior GOODFELLAS (1990) – which suggests that its best (and funniest) moments tend to involve the after-effects of the copious intake of drugs, notably DiCaprio getting tongue-tied during a vital telephone call and his 'spastic' attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home. For the record, film director Rob Reiner appears as Di Caprio's colourful dad and Jean Dujardin is a Swiss Bank manager (to where the countless millions are literally transferred out of the federal authorities' reach). On a personal note, I should say that I was expecting to hate this going in but I have had to eat my words and admit that it was an enjoyable if (no pun intended) taxing ride...which, as soon as it was over, made me run to the medicine cabinet and pop a headache pill myself!"

jarvislakerfan,"Aug 29, 2021",10/10,"Absolutely astonishing piece of movie making, doesn't feel dragged at any point and the very essence of excess is maintained throughout the movie. At the bottom of it all, Scorsese tries to show a picture so unbelievable you can actually see it happening, and not for a moment does it feel like we've escaped the real world, just that we've pushed its boundaries of what is okay and acceptable. Various scenes that may seem pointless paint a picture of a lifestyle so hopeless we can't help but feel sad for everyone involved."
monkyman347,"Dec 6, 2013",7/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street is a loud, flashy, and unfathomably vulgar movie populated by a wide variety of repulsive and narcissistic characters. In the hands of a lesser director, it could have easily ended up being unpleasant and unwatchable. However, thanks to acclaimed director Martin Scorsese's clever satirical touch and a witty script that surprises at every turn, The Wolf of Wall Street is a wild and uninhibited thrill-ride of a movie that's hard to forget.The movie tells the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who went from struggling to pay his bills to being one of the most wealthy but immoral and corrupt stockbrokers in the country. As he leads an increasingly reckless and dishonest life, Belfort quickly transforms from a law-abiding citizen to an uncaring white-collar criminal.Leonardo DiCaprio may have finally found his Oscar-winning role playing Jordan Belfort. Although his character is far too selfish to be likable, DiCaprio's spirited performance makes Jordan endlessly fascinating in his depravity. Jonah Hill gives an equally impressive performance as Donnie, Jordan's best friend and the co-founder of his firm. Hill's loud-mouthed and often inconsiderate behavior as Donnie makes for some of the funniest scenes in the movie.Although many of the scenes are far from light-hearted, The Wolf of Wall Street is ultimately a comedy. The characters' wildly reckless and irresponsible actions provide most of the humor. One particularly funny and memorable scene involves Jordan trying in vain to reach his car and drive home while under the influence of drugs he had taken. Unable to stand up and walk to the car, Jordan is forced to slide and drag his way across the floor, all the while yelling incoherent slurred sentences.Running in at 165 minutes, The Wolf of Wall Street is not a short movie by any means. Although it's always enthralling, there are a few scenes that could have easily been cut to shorten the running time. One series of scenes that wasn't necessary involves Jordan Belfort getting into a dispute with a butler over $50,000 in cash that went missing. The scenes are entertaining enough, but they have no relevance to the story as a whole and aren't essential to the movie.The Wolf of Wall Street is not the sort of movie one would expect a 71 year-old man to direct. Director Martin Scorsese is far from an ordinary 71 year-old man though, and with The Wolf of Wall Street he has crafted his most lively, compelling, and outrageous movie in years."
foxtografo,"May 10, 2014",7/10,"I'll start saying that I liked this movie, is fun and doesn't have the typical Hollywood filters and censure, that makes it authentic and explicit (sometimes that's good, or at least fun). It reminded me a lot to ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" which I love. That said, I don't think it is the masterpiece that most of the critics are proclaiming. DiCaprios acting is undeniably good, he's being growing up as an actor for many years and he has made very clear that he can make a movie good on his own, and this is one of those cases. The support actors are good in their roles (especially the short but excellent part of McConaughey) but the irreplaceable here is Di Caprio, he steals the show. Not much more than a showcase of fun events involving a group of drug addicts enjoying excess in every way possible, and how they go to hell for what they do. From my point of view, not a great story, and it could have been shorter too... Photography wasn't anything exceptional neither. But the good writing (even if it's a bit repetitive as a consequence of being so long) made me enjoy this movie a lot.Very good acting and writing, good/average photography and story.The movie is really good fun, if you have 3 hours to spend watching it!!"
truth-teller,"Mar 2, 2014",1/10,"To say I hated this film would be an understatement. I knew little about it, other than reading a review in Empire magazine a couple of days before. Approximately one hour in, I went and retrieved the magazine to read the review again because I could see no resemblance on screen to the reviewer's glowing praise on the page.Here I must admit to being female, and also totally appalled at the misogynistic, vile portrayal of just about every woman in this film. The only one that isn't pawed over, stripped and slapped about like a piece of meat is Jordan's first wife, but she is lied to, sidelined, betrayed and dropped as though she never meant a thing. The new wife that replaces her gets a 5 minute courtship, a honeymoon period of approximately the same duration, and is then firmly placed on the humiliation conveyor belt.As for the legions of whores and other apparently inconsequential women, just about every scene is filled with their degradation. Not even key colleagues get any respect, as one scene determinedly shows the only woman at work to be named down on her knees in a glass lift with her face firmly stuck to the front of some moron's flies.Yes, I am sure that being a woman has coloured my view of how women are portrayed in this film (and yes, the Empire reviewer was a man) but I notice I am not alone in being disgusted by the over-the-top porn and sheer vileness of behaviour that is revelled in and served up for what I am assured in other reviews is 2.1/2 hours. I probably lasted just over an hour before I gave up. Gave up hoping for any kind of story, gave up hoping for different characters instead of the same character assigned to just about every actor on screen. Gave up hoping that somebody, ANYBODY of the opposite sex might actually be treated fairly, even for half a minute.Where was the story? What was this about? What was the effect on the victims that were sold useless penny stocks? No, they don't feature either as the film relentlessly focuses on the bullies and morons that relieve them of their hard-earned cash with no glimpse of the consequences. When these heroes stop their carousing it is only to have pointless gibbering conversations about nothing which just serve to delay the orgies momentarily. Nothing is said that advances the story as the only story here is sex, drugs and exploitation. It is the pornographic equivalent of an evening looking at someone's boring holiday photos.There is zero progression, zero development, and - as far as I am concerned - zero interest in actually telling a story and entertaining the audience, just a determination to portray every excess known to man for no reason or purpose. Who cares if the real Jordan did any of this? I kept waiting for Vince Vaughn to show up as it was more like one of his puerile comedies than an Oscar-nominated film.I am old enough to have worked in a corporate environment in the City of London during the 80s. Yes the place was awash with money, but every woman was not treated like an expendable whore. Shame on Scorsese and all involved. I am no shrinking violet but so much emphasis on misogynistic, negative behaviour means little or no emphasis on anything else that could have made this a worthwhile film to watch. Ultimately it has nothing to say except F U, and does nothing but relieve the public of its entrance money with little return (true to its subject matter in that respect).This morning I watched District 9 which I had recorded on a whim and also knew nothing about. A film with plenty of heart, made on a tiny fraction of the budget blown on The Wolf of Wall Street, and to much greater effect. No prizes for guessing which of these films I would recommend."
ARMiiiN7,"Sep 1, 2016",10/10,"In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of excess. This movie is perfect view of biography that show how you can success!!! I love it! I show it more and more! And i not bored! Because this movie is full of dramatics scenes, tragedy scene, hopefully scenes, successful scenes and more... Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie was perfect!!! He knows me to how can beauty life whit more money!!! Since 2013 to now! I have never seen movie that can surprise me front of TV!!! And me proud to watching it!!! However i advise you to watching this movie for 10s or 12s!!! Because you can find more dimension of it!"
brianbisleri,"Jan 8, 2022",10/10,This movie becomes more iconic when you watch it under the watchful eye of a bag. Those who dislike simply don't understand the essence of Scorsese's brilliance and the implicit nuances of this masterpiece. Belfort portrayed perfectly by a man who was robbed of an Oscar by nothing more than stale political correctness.
vishal-lalani,"Jul 25, 2014",8/10,"I had heard some negative things about the movie, but finally ended up seeing it on a flight. its a long movie but doesn't feel like one. dicaprio acts brilliantly yet again. the movie is a true story of a wall street guy, and depicts his journey to the top; its a telling commentary on human greed. the fact that it was a true story somehow made a bigger impact on me. a valuable insight i got from the movie was how most of us are suckers as far as aggressive salespeople are concerned. they can cheat us, and yet keep selling to us again and again ! such is our greed and meekness ! scorcese is great at making biopics"

KiseFX,"May 29, 2019",9/10,"The legendary director has made his most playfully rambunctious and funniest film ever. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jordan, an ambitious stockbroker who learns all too well from his coke-snorting mentor that the trick to the business is making your own money from commissions.Jordan sets off on his own hawking penny stocks, and quickly figures out that -- because the commission rate is so much higher on them. He can quickly amass a personal fortune by following storyline."
angelinacharlieangel,"Jan 19, 2022",9/10,"A bright film about the rapid success of modern man. It is very dynamic, full of cool characters who make choices over and over again that affect the course of the story. Even the use of prohibited substances is done as if under a special look at the scene and the picture. Great actors! I'm a huge fan of the main cast. DiCaprio is no comment at all, the highest level I have ever seen."
lenabean25,"Aug 27, 2023",7/10,"DiCaprio and Hill give OUTSTANDING performances. But I rate it 7/10 because the film focuses WAY too much on the drugs, sex, and repugnant behavior. In my opinion this film characterizes Jordan Belford as an anti-hero when he is simply a narcissist and a con man. In my opinion, this film glorifies all the main characters as boys-will-be-boys who party excessively when they should be portrayed as criminals who lied cheated and stole to feed their greedy compulsions. The fact that they cast the real Jordan Belfort in a cameo is a slap in the face to his victims. I wish the film had shown the devastation he caused. Also, at three hours long the film is way to long. They could have told the same story if they cut out an hour of the explicit sex and drug use. There would still be two hours of sex and drugs."

inframan,"Jun 21, 2015",1/10,"There was a real opportunity here to make a powerful statement as well as a highly entertaining film but it got completely thrown out by the director & author of the screenplay. Instead of a stinging indictment and/or satire of Americann greed & lust we get an over- the-top presentation of sex & drugs as male pre-pubescent fantasy. Everything the average 13 year-old imagines his future to be. Not surprising given that the director Martin Scorsese gives the majority of his films the same blockbuster treatment: everything short of singing & tap dancing. The only other director using a similar approach is Baz Luhrman. Interesting that Dicaprio starred in this movie & Gatsby in the same year, highly miscast in both. Casting him is understandable: he's likable & cute & popular with the mainstream movie-going public. Here he basically replicates his performance in Catch Me If You Can. I don't say he's a bad actor, just wrong for the part. Here he reminds me of Bob Hope in something like Monsieur Beaucaire: likable but clueless as to what makes the character he's playing tick. Years ago there was a TV series called Profit in which Adrian Pasdar perfectly depicted a similar character. Ah well, gotta go for the biggest-paying demographic, I guess."
jan-parsons,"Dec 27, 2013",N/A,"This movie can be summarized as follows: DiCaprio is excellent; the movie is boring at its current 3 hours and needs to be cut to half its length.There's a thin story line running in the background which lightly covers the history of Stratton Oakmont (the boiler room stock brokerage firm). I came away feeling more like I'd watched an endless loop of the movie Hangover - sex/drugs/rockandroll. Here, there's maybe one hour of stuff that's worth watching and then literally 2 hours of nothing but snorting drugs, naked boobs, more naked boobs, and then more debauchery - no, I'm serious, NOTHING BUT that. Just to get my biases straight, I have no problem with naked bodies on screen (on the contrary!). But, it truly becomes boring when they stuff that much in your face. Really, what's the point?"
raamnar,"Jul 4, 2014",9/10,The wolf is brilliant with its fangs; however it veers sometime from the main drama of Wall street; too much sex and drug abuse gives an undesirable image of Wall street; Caprio and Scorsese are brilliant; I felt the single concept of Stone's Wall street to be more riveting; the film is too long and at times repetitive;...on the whole a valuable experience of human traits. 'Money brings in all kinds of comforts as well as problems' has been brilliantly portrayed. The ensemble acting is very good. Martin known for his gangster films tackles the financial racket with equal poise and is in total control. it gives at times a little bad taste with its explicit immorality in the money market; however the human greed is well brought out.
lvillanueva-34516,"Jul 18, 2018",9/10,"Funny, charming, and smart! Of course Leonardo DiCaprio does it again. With his smart witty character, this makes a boring stock broker job sound exhilarating. Enjoyed the movie from start to finish. If you want a good comedic drama. Then this is your movie!"
benkitching13,"Jul 14, 2018",9/10,"Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is a highly accomplished biographical dark comedy that encourages the viewer to revel in and be repulsed by the provocative life of it's protagonist: stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio). The cinematography and editing is slick and fast paced and the film is at it's most intoxicatingly best when pulsing with energy; complimented by a perfect soundtrack. Similarly, DiCaprio, Robbie and Hill succeed in delivering phenomenal performances. DiCaprio's running monologue is witty and the humour occasionally hilarious. However, when the energy fades away and the film slightly loses it's established rhythm does the quality slightly decline."
emryse,"Jan 2, 2022",9/10,"The big problem a lot of people seem to have with this film is that it ""glorifies"" a life of attractive women, enough drugs to kill a horse and conning the average American people out of millions of dollars. I disagree. When you see a man crawling across the ground, partially paralyzed from over dosing on drugs as his life crumbles around him I struggle to see what is so cool about him. I see the film as more of a parody of the twenty first century, showing a mans life falling apart around him as he goes after more and more money, more than any one person really needs but still feeling it isn't enough. The cinematography is brilliant as is the direction by Scorsese, his choices of music perfectly compliment the on screen action and on a technical level I can't fault the film.I love the actors working here, just all top notch no matter the size of their part. Leonardo DiCaprio gives possibly the best performance in his career, Margot Robbie could charm the socks off of a stone wall and Jonah Hill is so supremely dislikeable that every time I see his face I want to punch him. I've read reviews saying that the film doesn't give enough information on how the scam that was being peddled worked and while I can admit that there wasn't much information given on how it worked I think it plays into the film that we are told we are too stupid to understand it, like these Wall Street people couldn't get any more pretentious. To conclude I love this film, I think it works amazingly as a movie and even better as a satire of our times. 9/10."
lorenzosfarra,"May 3, 2014",8/10,"I'm very far to be an expert, so my opinion is just the one of a ""common person"" who watches movies in the night to have fun / enjoy some time. My opinion is that the movie is very attracting, it's fast and you don't get bored. There is a good plot and when you can get lost or bored, there are some scenes that make you laugh or, anyway, catchy enough to catch again your attention. Anyway, after 2 hours, I have to say that I've started to look at the watch, because I was tired. That's it. It was absolutely enough, without removing anything special to the plot, to have a 2 hours movie. Di Caprio is absolutely great, but the other main characters are great, too. My vote would have been 9 without doubts."

kosterjason77,"Mar 26, 2014",7/10,"I'm sorry to say but for the first time, the critics were pretty spot on with this. The acting performances of both Leonardo DeCaprio and Jonah Hill were top notch and most definitely worthy of the accolades they have received, but the movie it self seemed like it was on massive quantities of drugs. It was a great story, but it was told in such a choppy manner, some of the scenes were so over the top I felt like I was watching another Tucker Maxx movie. I was really hoping for more. Great acting (Rob Reiner deserved an Oscar nomination too)...OK movie...and it was WAY too long!!! I don't know how he did it, but Scorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours. He couldn't do a 3 hour version of Goodfellas or The Departed, but managed to extend the life of this for 3 hours? Again, I was really hoping for more."
AkKrock,"Dec 23, 2018",10/10,"Biographies are booring most of the time. But this movie is different. Full action with best acting, this movie will take you places."
cguldal,"Jun 3, 2014",7/10,"This is one of those films that will make the smart consumer think about what it means to ""like"" a piece of art work (if you can call Hollywood filmmaking that). Is the film glorifying the horrible crimes that Belfort and his cronies committed, and if so, can one still judge the film and the actors based on their performance and not on the morality of its subject matter? It's difficult, and I respect both types of opinions.Just looking at the film as a fictional story (which I am sure it is, mostly, since Belfort seems to have a knack for embellishing the truth and making a seemingly uninteresting thing the most exciting thing in the world to sell it as best as he can), the plot is rather formulaic for Hollywood standards. Character development is not the main point here, as the characters are larger than life caricatures, even down to the ""boy scout"" FBI guy who has it in for the bad guy (whose motives and story are almost entirely unknown to us, since the story is narrated by Belfort). DiCaprio is in top form, but the rest of the actors and actresses take the prize in genuinely thrilling performances. The acting is probably the best aspect of the film (apart from the glimmer and shine), as every single main and supporting role is played to full potential and perfectly to fit the caricature written out for it.Perhaps the most interesting character is Belfort's number 1, Donnie. We see more character development here, where the nerdy and greedy guy rises to the top and lives a very large life. His morals seem even more lacking than Belfort's, but this is perhaps because Belfort is telling the story.The other interesting, though not novel, part of the story is the role of drugs in Wall Street. Drugs and inevitably sex. It is perhaps alarming that the markets that can ruin our lives by crashing, etc. are run by people who abuse drugs all the time. Belfort is not the one to say this first, and I am sure he won't be the last, either.All in all, the film is ""entertaining,"" if not cringe-worthy. Some moments that are absolutely hilarious in their absurdity can make you cry if you lost a lot of money in the market or lost your job in the recent economic crisis, because in reality, they are not funny. That a company can make billions within hours of a launch, well, that is just sickening no matter what your world view is, unless you are the guy who is making all the money (in which case it is kind of sickening, still, but in a different way).Moralistically, the film is like any art work that deals with humans who commit crimes. I did not find it more glorifying than mafia films where the godfather orders people's deaths ""for the family."" The truth is most humans have a moral understanding and ways to justify their actions according to some moral structure, no matter how twisted or unorthodox the rest of the people might think their structure is. Belfort justified his actions in some ways, and his actions hurt people (including his family), like any other criminal. I did not come away with a message from the film that said ""What Belfort did was awesome!"" It was certainly something more like ""Belfort was successful. His success hurt other people and helped some others. In general, he was an asshole, who did not care much about anyone, but himself and for anything, but getting rich.""The real message is: don't invest your money in the stock market unless you are filthy rich. And even then, don't invest too much of it."
Paul Day,"Jul 12, 2014",1/10,"Two and a half hours into the film and I was non the wiser on where I was being taken. Character and storyline development was sidestepped for a vulgar expression of the American psyche - overt sexuality, the glorification of the abuser with no reference at all to the abused, excess without meaning.Many seem to believe that this is the crowning achievement of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio clearly lacks the depth of character that he has shown in many of his previous movies. He seems to have taken a step backwards, yelling, screaming and over-acting at every instance. As for Scorsese, more and more over time I am missing the point of his movies. They are - dull and lack the intelligent treatment of characters that he had in his early films.There are times when you seriously question why directors going off on major tangents in their careers, and why some wonderful actors continue to follow those directors. It is certainly time for DiCaprio to get out from under the shadow of Scorsese who seems to be slowly losing the plot.I did not enjoy the film in the slightest."
RyanCShowers,"Dec 31, 2013",N/A,"When The Wolf of Wall Street first begins its nearly three hour running-time, you aren't exactly sure when the opening studio titles end and the film begins because of Scorsese's stylized letterboxing academy ratios with certain scenes, emphasizing a television type framing as opposed to the rest of the film's widescreen cinematography. The questioning doesn't stop there; after the entire year of anticipation, the story of Jordan Belfort unfolds for the first hour, I continued to wonder when the real The Wolf of Wall Street was going to start.I follow numerous accounts on Instagram, on Christmas morning I came across a screenshot someone took on their iPhone of an elderly female critic reviewing The Wolf of Wall Street. With rotten icon from Rotten Tomatoes and the preview of her review stating, ""Too much sex and drug use,"" I rolled my eyes in agreement with the Instagram account of the unfair criticism. Then I saw The Wolf of Wall Street and realized it was not just a senior citizen compliant, I think Scorsese crossed the line of fun and entered an area of repugnance.I may be the only member of my age group (18-24) who complains about the overuse of sex, greed, and drugs, call me an old man, but after a three hours enough is enough. If The Wolf of Wall Street had some sense of a moral compass that drove the narrative, I may not criticize this aspect so harshly, but neither Scorsese nor the screenplay has anything to offer the audience to latch onto in selfish, unlikable, pathetic characters.Scorsese had to tell the story of Jordan Belfort and I'm sure his life was as unruly as the film paints it to be, but he abandons any sense of class. This is not the Scorsese we all have been enamored with the past. The Wolf of Wall Street is the type of film to be enjoyed by the same audience as The Hangover, not award voting Academy members or critical film analysts. I kept having the feeling I had seen this exact same film in May with flashier costumes, called The Great Gatsby. Wolf is not that far off from it, a few steps above Gatsby in terms of quality filmmaking, but the empty feeling it gives off to the audience is no different.Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese's fifth collaboration has been brewing in the minds of everyone who enjoyed their previous films and hope that one day they can finally ""click"" the way Scorsese did with Robert DeNiro back at the apex of their careers. The best thing The Wolf of Wall Street has on its side is Leonardo DiCaprio's eminent charm; he melts his audience and hits some of the greatest highs of his acting career. Certainly deserves to be included in any of the Best Actor races this award season.The Wolf of Wall Street's problems do not stem from the technicalities of filmmaking. Though the storytelling half of Scorsese's job that could have been executed much better, at least he forms the shell of a quality movie. His films typically have a masterwork of film editing; the editing for Wolf is no exception. It is like DiCaprio is snapping his fingers the whole for the three hours. The look of the film is another strength. The juicy cinematography looks as if it was painted with the infinite money made my Jordan Belfort.Some of Scorsese's past film successes find themselves drilled into The Wolf of Wall Street. The first person point of view from Goodfellas and Casino is put to good use, it even grows in this film. DiCaprio not only narrates the majority of the film, but also pulls a Woody Allen and looks directly at the audience and speaks to us like we are having a private conversation with Jordan Belfort. His obsession with wealth and drugs damaging his life and family echoes from Raging Bull, but this works against Wolf. In Raging Bull we saw Jake LaMotta beat his wife, but we also felt his guilt. There's a scene in Act Three that feels like a direct homage to Raging Bull, but Wolf lacks the humanity of that film. Scorsese wanted to isolate us from the world in Wolf like he did in Taxi Driver, where we understood the violence Travis yearned for, but here Wolf fails to tug at the same cords with greed as Taxi Driver did with loneliness.At the end of the day does the greedfest of The Wolf of Wall Street matter? No. If it were not so hollow, it could have been a fun movie, but I didn't even buy into the ""enjoyment."" People around me were laughing at the slapstick comedy, but I did not find most of it funny, not even DiCaprio's raved physical comedy scene in the last section of the film. I shrugged my shoulders after the first thirty seconds and then the scheme continued for five more minutes. Not a bad film, a bad narrative, and a poorly communicated film. If I retitled the film, it would read: The Disappointment of Wall Street.Grade: B-Rating: 6"
vikinikk,"Sep 4, 2021",10/10,3 hours and not even 1 second of boredom. I was fully invested the whole time!
constance22,"Jan 4, 2014",8/10,"I walked out of this movie after 1 1/2 hrs. and I love Leonardo above all actors.This was such an empty movie and Leo was handsome as ever but vacant.Really Mr. Scorcese, why? And then Leo, why??????I was forewarned by many reviews but went ahead because it was Leo starring. Thank goodness there are so many excellent films of his to offset this bomb. I will watch ""The Departed"" or The Aviator tonight.I understand that this is taken from a true story about a soulless man who is now some kind of coach. But why did Scorcese and Leo make a film about such an unimportant person and even a vile person. Movie full of drugs, sex and violence and not in a good way. Compared to American Hustle it's truly a loser. I can't believe people are suggesting that Leo should get an Oscar for this garbage."
ronakkotian,"Feb 18, 2021",10/10,"The collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio is a pairing that I don't want to end. I believe The Wolf of Wall Street to be their best collaboration to date.The Wolf of Wall Street shows us the life of Jordan Belfort from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.Out of all the Scorsese films I have seen, The Wolf of Wall Street might be the most fun and entertaining. I've seen this film multiple times and I'm still not bored of it. Scorsese's direction is impeccable as always. He manages to capture the high life and excess of Wall Street brokers so perfectly without holding back on anything. The structure is very similar to Goodfellas but I didn't mind it because I felt it was an appropriate choice for this story. The editing is on point despite the 3 hour runtime. I was having so much fun with this film that I couldn't believe how quick 3 hours went by which is a testament as to how good the Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is. There is such a level of insanity and adrenaline to this story that gets me excited each time I watch it. This is most likely Scorsese's funniest film. The dialogues and dark humour are absolutely hilarious. Scorsese loves to have actors improvise scenes and it amazed how many scenes are actually improvised which goes to show the talent these actors possess.I consider Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as the sex-crazed, drug addicted Jordan Belfort to be his best. As much I loved Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, I honestly think DiCaprio deserved the Oscar for this film. The insane energy he brought to the character of Belfort is incredible. This is also Jonah Hill's best performance to date. There are quite a few moments where he completely shines. A particular scene where Hill and DiCaprio take drugs and enact the effects of it is enough to show fantastic their acting is. This is where I discovered Margot Robbie for the first time and she blew me away with her performance. She nailed the accent and surprised me by how great of an actress was. Matthew McConaughey appears for a short time but is easily one of the most memorable parts of the film. It was nice to see Rob Reiner back who is so funny here. Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal do a marvellous job as well.Some would say the film glorifies the lifestyle Jordan Belfort lived which I totally disagree. I think showing the excessive drug use and sex is important for this story so you can really get an idea as to how these people lived. There is no sugar-coating of any kind and it's important to remember the consequences of living such a life.The Wolf of Wall Street is easily one of my favourite Martin Scorsese films. The fast-paced frenetic energy of the story is so exhilaritating to watch. The performances all round are amazing and I don't think I'll ever get bored of The Wolf of Wall Street."
preppy-3,"Feb 9, 2014",9/10,Movie based on the life of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). He was a poor man who joined Wall Street in the late 1980s. He slowly built his way up to the top--making his own company and doing anything (legal or illegal) to come out on top. He also became addicted to drugs and sex and it slowly destroys him.A VERY good but not great Scorsese film. Let's get the negatives out of the way first--it's far too long at 3 hours (this could easily have lost 30 minutes); Jonah Hill is TERRIBLE and annoying in a supporting role; the constant swearing and screaming gets tiresome; there's WAY too much female nudity (while a scene with male nudity was cut down to nothing) and there's no real ending...it just sort of stops. Still I loved it a lot more than I hated it. The acting was great by everybody (save Hill). DiCaprio was brilliant in the title role. Who knew he could do comedy as well as drama? He anchors this film and he's never less than mesmerizing. As I said mostly everybody else is good but special mention must be made for Margot Robbie (as his second wife Naomi) and Joanna Lumley who is incredible as Aunt Emma. The story moves fairly quickly and there's a great use of period music. So this is excellent but not great Scorsese.

tanmoypapairoy,"Oct 24, 2016",7/10,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" paints a very decadent picture of the financial sector and its corrupted denizens, perverted by money and greed.

Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs. The cast is fantastic and DiCaprio gives his best and most fun filled performance to date."

Congratulations to Scorsese for knowing his audience. Interesting to see so many people under 18 laughing at the drug abuse. IMDb requires 10 lines of text to issue this review, but really, how long was Scorsese's outline of this movie. I doubt it was that long. Let's see, show lots of naked bodies, throw in continuous offensive language, snort all the cocaine off the naked bodies, villanize stockbrokers...yep, that is a great formula for getting high ratings and making lots of money."

TdSmth5,"Jan 22, 2014",8/10,"Jordan Belfort arrives in Wall Street and gets a job selling stocks over the phone. The environment is vulgar, brutal, ruthless. One of the senior guys takes him to lunch and gives him the lessons to survive. The main point is to put money from the customers in their pockets, not so much enrich their customers.When Black Friday hits, Belfort is out of a job, and ends up working at a company of amateurs selling penny stocks. He does so well that he ends up opening his own firm ripping people off. He hires friends and shady characters. One of them introduces him to drugs. They are so wildly successful that they pretty much don't know what to do with all their money. He becomes addicted to money, power, and all drugs he can get his hands on. His wife divorces him and he marries the gorgeous Naomi.As the feds start snooping around his business, which involves everything illegal under the sun, he decides to move his money to a Swiss bank and Naomi's English aunt helps in the process as well as various carriers who transport millions of cash by hand. Eventually, the government catches up with him as his life unravels.The Wolf of Wall Street is your typical Scorsese ""rise and fall of a bad guy"" movie. It's a bit different in so far as Belfort is nowhere near as likable as the other Scorsese main characters. Here you are not wishing for Belfort to escape and get away. You want him to face justice. And violence has been replaced with comedy. Much of this overlong movie is made up of comedy skits basically. There's DiCaprio on drugs, DiCaprio having deranged sex, there's DiCaprio fooling his wife into doing naughty things in front of a hidden camera, there's the company jerks throwing little people at a target, etc, etc. This movie could have easily been cut by at least half an hour. There's also not nearly enough drama.Most disappointing is the lack of any sort of moral message, if you will. It shouldn't have been difficult to point out the insane misantrophy of Wall Street folks. But there's only very little of that. Given that the finance world still gets away with murder, or perhaps these days even more so, it's not clear why Winter, Scorsese, the producers, anyone, was not interested in taking the opportunity to scold the finance world.Acting is OK. DiCaprio is strong except for the scenes where he's motivating his employees. There are too many scenes of those and DiCaprio doesn't convey the charisma necessary. Margot Robbie is the revelation here. I'm not crazy about the rest of the cast- Hill in particular doesn't convince.Like all stories about larger than life personalities written by themselves, much probably didn't happen as told. Nevertheless and despite the excessive lengthy, Wolf of Wall Street is entertaining yet surprisingly and unnecessarily superficial."

HabibieHakim123,"May 2, 2021",10/10,"""Scorsese at his finest spirit, yes, 3 hours biopic movie, tells a life story of Jordan Belfort, Dicaprio great perfomance makes this movie really really work well, becoming one of the most entertaining 3 hours movie i've ever watch, very well writen, great cinematography, all Scorsese stuff that i'll never get bored, The Wolf Of Wall Street is simply a long must watch movie, i highly recommended"""
mm-75687,"Feb 16, 2021",9/10,"This movie is so funny. I can't watch it enough. I don't know how true to history it is, but it is fun to watch. It is hard to imagine any financial office could be that kind of insane asylum. Great acting and a funny concept."
stevieb10019,"Dec 26, 2013",6/10,"I saw the trailers. I was all in. The movies was going to be bigger than life: ride the tail of a major swindler, see what life was like among the obscenely rich and luxurious. The film is uneven: it's bigger than life, but it's also sad and painful to watch, and it's also funny. There's lots of great scenes, but it just doesn't hang together. I was willing to bet on a winner by Scorsese. Lots of amazing performances. Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better. He's in great shape. At times, he reminded me of a young Jack Nicholson. Jonah Hill is great, and steady through out. Some wonderful small gems of parts played by Matthew McConaughey, (who doesn't seem fully recovered from the Dallas Buyers Club), Rob Reiner, Joanna Lumley and the French handsome leading man, Jean Dujardin. The film made me feel as though I'd been taken for a ride, and it's too long ride at that, at 3 hours."
kew5953,"Dec 21, 2013",N/A,"The story has been told before. The style has been used before. There is nothing new here. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is not a badly mad film, rather the movie is stale and tired 5 minutes into its 3-hour run.That Scorsese cannot find a more mature subject matter than greed, sex, and drugs is a little sad. With those themes for a plot, why not just make porn. The audience would be wider, and the profits greater.As for being a dark comedy, that might be a tough sell, give that comedy tends to be more individualized and subjective than drama. Perhaps I am just getting too old to find humor in debauchery. However, I did laugh out loud once during the park bench scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Joanna Lumley. Now *that* woman knows how to deliver a comedic line.I did not hate the movie, but I did not love it. It was okay. If you have nothing better to do on a winter's day, go see it. There are worse ways to waste your time."
leonblackwood,"May 24, 2014",8/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this epic movie which keeps you on the end of your seat from beginning to end. Although the film is about serious issues, there is some really funny scenes, especially between DiCaprio and Hill who had great chemistry. The storyline goes from one extreme to the next, which is what made it hard to believe that it was based on a true story. The amount of money that the traders go through is ridiculous and the whole care free attitude had to come to a halt at some point. At nearly 3 hours long, the director done well to keep the movie interesting and a joy to watch. I never thought that I would say this, but it is in the same class as the original Wall Street which was a tough act to follow. A Great Watch!Round-Up: DiCaprio really showed that he is a top class actor with his performance in this movie. He really needed to dig deep to make this character believable because of the amount of drugs, cash and women that him and his friends went through, under the eyes of the law. Jonah Hill was an excellent choice to play DiCaprio's partner in crime who also showed that a different side to his acting skills. Even Matthew McConaughey was brilliant, with his weird expressions and phrases which were a great way to kick off the movie. Anyway, it's very hard to find anything wrong with this film, although some of the speeches on the microphone did drag on, but that's just me being picky. Its definitely worth a watch!Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $390millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there witty dramas about the crazy world of a stock trader who works hard and definitely parties extremely hard. 8/10"
trevorj-38641,"Apr 2, 2022",9/10,"Just a great film, amazing performances by all, especially Leo, robbed of an Oscar, again doesn't get the praise it deserves, prob the subject matter."
rajshah991,"May 9, 2014",9/10,"From the scene one when the lion walks in the office bay of Stratton Oakmont you know the movie is going to be awesome, and so it is.After django Unchained, The great Gatsby the role of Jordan Belfort is as natural as it can be for Leonardo DiCaprio(a very likable scoundrel). The role of Leo was to do one thing and one thing only to keep the audience Enthralled for 3 hrs of anecdotes, Drama, Drugs, party, music, money, girls, Sex, corruption, a Lamborghini countach! is in there too.The performance of Jonah Hill was only getting ostentatious as the movie progressed from leaving his job instantaneously, the manner in which he expressed the idea of Steve Madden, the after lemmon effect!, of course its the best we have ever seen of him. and hope fully not the last. Scorsese's previous projects physiological thriller shutter island and child sci-Fi Hugo were good as a side project but to me this was the best of Martin Scorsese since the Good fellas(1990) and casino(1995).To conclude the movie has a great story, amazing lead performances and a brilliant direction. what more can anyone want."
FirstNameLastName24,"Sep 3, 2019",10/10,"This movie is really fantastic. It is absurdly funny and revels in its own excess, while never losing the dark and dramatic undertone that becomes its true purpose. It illustrates human greed, corruption, addiction and depravity while staying laugh-out-loud hilarious and nothing less than shocking due to the sheer amount of sex, drugs and swearing. This film will surely offend many who watch it, and many more will miss the point of the film, but it remains one of Scorsese's many masterpieces. Also, DiCaprio nails every minute of his performance, and Margot Robbie is nothing less than stunning."
drachenakz,"Oct 10, 2021",10/10,This movie is incredible because it is based on a true story. Whether or not the actions of Jordan Belfort were ethically correct should not detract from the veracity by which he lived his life. All the people who are damning Jordan's actions wouldn't have the balls to live a fraction of the life he lived. This movie is a story of the true American dream which is one without bounds.
Westland_,"May 27, 2022",8/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street near-perfectly satirises the absurd culture surrounding Wall Street - highlighting the sordid underbelly of America's financial centre.Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey all offer particularly stellar performances, elevating their roles.The movie does have some faults, some scenes feel unnecessary or drawn out, and the movie itself can become a bit too long for its own good - but it does not detract very much from what is an incredibly funny comedy and well-crafted satire at almost every other stage."
sanel-babic,"Jan 3, 2014",6/10,"If it was not for great story line, outstanding actors... I would call this movie a pure Porn. Distasteful. Trailer definitely did not prepare me for the nudity and amount of sex scenes onslaught. For sure not a movie you should watch with your relatives.Leo definitively did one of his greatest performances of his career. Scene after scene, pulling everything that makes a great actor; passion, emotion, and delivery. Story line is what makes this movie recommendable.Another surprise was the length of the movie, 3h+... they could have done away with 15 sex scenes, and made it a ""normal"" movie."
zkonedog,"Jan 19, 2023",4/10,"From what I understand, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is loosely based on a real-life individual. However, director Martin Scorsese delivers such an over-the-top caricature that either Jordan Belfort was truly the wildest individual to ever roam this planet or this is the most bonkers ""based on a true story"" liberty-taking of all time.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Belfort (Leonard DiCaprio), a Wall Street banker who experiences a market crash on his first day in NYC. As such, he starts his own firm--Stratton Oakmont--duping clients into buying massive amounts of penny stocks. But Belfort is an excellent con man, and soon he's challenging Wall Street institutions in terms of profit. Along the way, he lives the most profane, drug-addled, sexually promiscuous, over-the-top lifestyle one could possibly imagine. All this puts him on the radar of the FBI, of course, in particular Agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) who is out for the bust of his life.At heart, I think ""Wolf of Wall Street"" is a parody of Wall Street culture--the kind of shyster existence that generates as much depravity as it does wealth. I'm sure there are some genuine lessons to be learned from all that.The problem here is that Scorsese leans so hard into the debauchery of the whole scene that by the end I didn't find anything or anyone likable. I don't consider myself a prude by any means (especially when it comes to movies), but the amount of profanity, drug use, and sexual antics in ""Wolf"" did reach--and surpass--my limits. There is not a nuanced moment in the entire picture--everything is a slap to the face, so to speak.All of that being said, there are just enough things happening in ""Wolf"" to make it somewhat memorable: DiCaprio is on fire from beginning to end, Margot Robbie is utterly entrancing, Jonah Hill is reliable solid, and it has certainly produced some gif-able moments or speeches.But other than those aesthetic pop culture snippets, I found the whole of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to be quite a mess. Mainly for a lack of nuance in trying to convey any sort of message about Wall Street and its ilk. By the end, I felt bludgeoned to death as opposed to thoughtful or engaged."
GayFrogMaiden,"Sep 29, 2018",8/10,"The Wolf of wall street is a riveting film. It's funny, dark, and suprisingly fast paced throughout even though it's 3 hrs long. I feel the length is a bit long for the film, I felt that 5-10 mins could have been cut off the film, and it would've been better.You have great performances from Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, along side some fantastic direction from Martin Scorsese.This film really looks in to what money can do to people, how it effects people, and how greedy we can become when we earn alot of money.I like how Jordan Belfort has no remorse and doesn't care what happens, but this is also a problem, due to the character having no remorse, his character doesn't really change at all, by the end, he's still pretty much the same person as he was at the beginning, with some slight changes.It's a great film to watch with a bunch of blokes and I feel it better suits Males than Females. The Cinematography is creative and varied, with some great shots thrown in there.It's a film where characters don't really change or grow, but it does this to great effect to further show what mass amounts of money can do to people.I had a great time watching it and I would definitely recommend it if you were looking for a great time.8.5/10."
neagucatalinaflorentina,"Aug 9, 2014",10/10,"This movie was amazing! Someday, I'll watch it again! And DiCaprio is a genius actor. I just... I love him! Also, my friends have the same reactions and opinions like mine. They recommended me this movie and I will thank them forever! I mean, this movie made me laugh so hard and is a cool movie. I like everything about this movie, even the name! I love the wolves and the name is ingenious. The action is very closer of the reality and I think this is a huge advantage for this movie. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a movie that comes with a new idea and I think is very inspiring. Definitely, I gave ten stars because is a really good movie and it deserves to be watched. I will also recommend this movie to other friends, too!"
sebastiankonofal,"May 15, 2021",9/10,"Finally Leo gets an Oscar, but not just for this role, he amazes us every time we see him on the screen! But this one in particular is where I'd like to think that he just nailed the role. He knew who to be and how to live like a particular character would in this sort of scenario. But what I'm trying to say is that he he and Everton e in this film made it what it was. An outlandish concept that was executed perfectly. The story is amazing and the path that Leo takes as a character builds a stronger connection to the plot! Where this film suicided is how well and progressive the story was told, where we as viewers were able to follow it all the way. And with Leo's great acting he made it smooth to go through. THIS FIPM IS A GAME CHANGER for the filming community, why? Because it tells an original story that was written so well where towards the end we even feel sympathy for the police that's an antagonist in that move! This movie has changed how characters react with villains on every moview afyer it BECAUSE! In this film everyone is a villan, but we understand everyone's ambitions and goals to the point where we're intrigued as to how it goes.And for one more note, this movie has shown that if you take the rights spets in how reactions translate in a script to the final cut you can keep the story afloat almost comparable to the entire story of Lord of the rings where the story makes sense yet takes to places you wouldn't've guessed based on the start (At least before the interview lmao)Well written and well executed in just 3h it will feel like 45min.Why 9/10 because as you may know in film we always know that there is room for improvement no matter how good the films are, that's exactly how you know if someone is giving an honest review rather than saying ""10/10 good film. Would recommend 😀"" that's just not how we do things 😉"
jaydenmccagh,"Aug 15, 2021",10/10,Wow. This movie is incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio is incredible and I can't wait to watch more of him! He absolutely embodies the role of Jordan and I lose myself in his performance! Outstanding acting!Scorsese's directing is impeccable (like always) so there's that to enjoy.Margot Robbie was amazing as Naomi! (Nadine) She played the part perfectly. Margot will always be my favourite actress but I loved her in this!I surprisingly never found Jonah Hill annoying in this movie (I always do!) he also did a great job on the role of Donnie!I've been interested in Jordans story for years but to finally see the whole movie was incredible.Once again the acting is incredible! Such an interesting story too! Overall 9/10! Fantastic!
mattdaniel-91857,"Sep 4, 2016",10/10,"This is one of Scorsese's best films, and the best of 2013. Driven by a performance that should have won DiCaprio an Oscar, Scorsese turns another true story into a powerful movie. It is modern Goodfellas, where Jordan Belfort makes a name for himself on Wall Street just like how Henry Hill made his way up the mafia. While it is not quite as good of a movie as Goodfellas, it is unique in its excessive showing of sex and drug use.First off, this movie is freaking hilarious, and wildly entertaining. The humor is mixed in perfectly so it adds to the story. Additionally, Jonah Hill does a great job as a supporting actor. Some people Don't like this film because of how explicit and over the top it is. But it is really just an accurate portrayal of the events (as confirmed by the real Jordan Belfort) that drives the message home.Scorsese and Dicaprio condemn Belfort's style of living, and not directly. Instead, they convey their message by showing what actually happened (as well as the consequences) and are able to powerfully convey their point of view while making an entertaining and amusing film."
rtk-jagyasi,"Jan 4, 2014",6/10,"Okay. Its a Scorsese movie and I was told it is his best movie ever and Leo is definitely winning an Oscar for this. And then it turns out to be a pointless, unfunny American Pie/Project X stuff with A-level actors and a Wall Street backdrop.Some parts of the movie were brilliant. But honestly, these parts summed up to almost 30 minutes of a 3 hour long movie. I think the movie will appeal only to those who will be hearing so many curse words first time in their lives. There were many people at the cinema actually laughing at the reference of 'Moby Dick'. So, if you only want to hear some 800 curse words, with a lot of sex and drugs all at the same time without any sense, go for it. But if you are expecting some serious Scorsese kind of 3 hour drama with a nerve-wrecking climax, this movie is a big letdown."
hudini669,"Jan 9, 2014",6/10,"With all the hype surrounding 'The Wolf of Wall Street', I went to see it expecting something mind-blowing, but what I've seen was a mediocre biopic at best.It is clear that Scorsese's intention here was obviously to make the new 'Goodfellas' or even the new 'Godfather', but most of the time 'The Wolf' runs flat and fails to engage. I couldn't really tell whose fault that was, because the the pacing was pretty solid for a three hour flick and the balance between comical and serious bits was just about right, but I somehow failed to care about pretty much anything going on in the film.Everything that happens on the screen seems to just happen; there is no real plot, there is no real suspense and there is no real development of any kind. All character development happens in the first 15 minutes or so, and from that point on 'The Wolf' is just a steady flatland ride filled with gang bangs, drug abuse, cock jokes, cursing and generally bad taste, most of which serves the story itself in no way, but has somehow managed to create enough hype to be listed among 100 best films of all time here at IMDb.I can understand all the hype about Leonardo DiCaprio, because he was really good, but the sea of mediocrity surrounding him might have made him look a bit better than he actually was. What I don't understand is the general word about this film being the best Scorsese's work ever. In my opinion, this one doesn't come even close to 'The Departed', not the mention the real classics as 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' or 'The Taxi Driver'. What I especially do not understand are the stories about Matthew McConaughey deserving an Oscar for supporting role... for a mere three minute long Christopher Walken cameo impersonation?! I mean, come on, people!All in all, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is not a bad film, but it's far from good and it's far from being a classic. It has its moments, but most of the time it's far from excellence once made by Martin Scorsese. I wouldn't go that far to call it forgettable, but I have a strong feeling it won't be talked about this much in just a year or two. Time will tell.6/10"
lopezpatricia-06139,"Jun 24, 2021",1/10,To illustrate I'm no prude I confess I've prob done more drugs that the lot of em. But this film was disgusting. Doing hookers in front of everyone the absurd frat boy raucous testosterone fuelled crap. This film annoyed me from the first five mins to the bitter end. You don't need to be of a sensitive disposition for this film to offend you as it's so extreme it put my debauched life into a shadow. Ugh just ugh.
athina-anyfantaki,"Apr 22, 2014",N/A,"Okayy Leo Di Caprio was just amazing in this film!!! His performance could have absolutely won him an Oscar and it was such a shame he didn't get one. Also, I have to say it was one of Scorsese's best films as there were some unbelievable scenes!! I really liked the screenplay but I have to say that the movie was just endless!! (about 3 hours?) In the beginning I just loved it but then somewhere in the middle it started getting really tiring and at points even quite boring..there were many scenes that were a complete waste of time and a repetition of something we had already seen before..I mean seriously if it was half an hour shorter I would have rated it with a 9! Anyway, overall I think it was a great movie and despite its duration, it's totally worth watching!!"
maxkorus,"May 8, 2021",8/10,"I think this film is objectively great. Great performances, great cinematography, great directing. The relationship between Jordan and his 2nd wife reminds me a lot of the Robert De Niro/Sharon Stone relationship from Casino. It was done better in Casino in my opinion but it's done great in this film as well. Having said all that, I think this movie is slightly overrated. If I had to rank all the Scorsese films I've seen (which is about 70% of them) it would probably land around the middle. DiCaprio gives a great performance but like Scorsese, I don't think it's his best. Still a great film that I would recommend to pretty much anyone who enjoys movies, as Scorsese's 'middle of the pack' films manage to blow most other films out of the water."
paologerardo,"Aug 15, 2021",9/10,"I loved The Wolf of Wall Street! The truth is that I had a good time almost 3 hours long, with a very dynamic and entertaining pace that helps a lot so that the film does not feel heavy. The performances are excellent but the one I want to highlight is the great Leonardo DiCaprio, GOD! What a great actor. How well written the character is and the great charisma of the actor makes Jordan Belford, a pretty nice guy despite some things he does during the film. The truth is that I had a lot of fun and what better than with a very good movie!"
mushangamunkombwe,"Jul 12, 2023",10/10,"Has to be the best performance by DiCaprio that I've ever seen. He plays the character so perfectly that even I, a person who doesn't really pay much attention to how actors act, was able to notice the difference in terms of how talented he is as an actor (you get what I mean??). The plot, the humor, the performances, just everything in this movie is so brilliant it didn't even feel like a 3hour movie. There's a reason this DiCaprio guy is the source of so many memes lol. I rarely give a 10/10 review but man, I really enjoyed this movie...I wish I could watch it again for the first time lol. I'd 100% recommend you to watch."
verneylmavt,"Jul 1, 2025",9/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street drops you into what looks like another dry finance story, but right away you know you're in for something wild. Instead of a snooze-fest about numbers and graphs, Scorsese turns the whole thing into a high-energy thrill ride. You'll feel the buzz of those boiler-room trades and the rush of that first big payday, all while laughing at just how over-the-top it gets.Leo DiCaprio brings so much charm and cheek to Jordan Belfort that you almost forget you're watching a guy who's basically running a scam. And the supporting cast? They lean into the craziness like pros, making every scene feel like a fast-paced comedy sketch. Scorsese's signature cuts and split-screens keep things moving so fast you barely notice you've been sitting for three hours.What really makes this movie click is how Scorsese flips the script on the usual financial drama. You expect boardroom tension and boring number-crunching, but instead you get wild yacht parties, non-stop one-liners, and a look at the darker side of ""the good life"" without ever feeling preachy. It's like he said, ""Let's make a party movie about stock fraud,"" and then he just ran with it.By the end, you're left dazzled and slightly dizzy, marveling at how a story about penny stocks turned into one of the funniest, most outrageous films of the decade. It's a masterclass in taking boring subject matter and injecting it with so much energy and wit that you won't be able to look at Wall Street the same way again."
mattb-54569,"Jan 13, 2019",10/10,"I am sorry to all of those who are offended by this movie but, go watch something else. This is by far my absolute favorite movie of all time. It is entertaining from start to finish with an amazing cast that makes it even better. Perfectly directed! Perfectly acted! Story is perfectly told! It is just overall the perfect movie in my opinion, for I can watch this over and over and it never gets old. Thank you Scorsese you continue to show us that you are an amazing director!"
R-Clercx,"Jan 10, 2014",7/10,"Three hours is simply too much of a half good thing. Scorsese probably wanted to emanate in the montage the coke fueled consciousness of stock broker Di Caprio who can't decide if he wants to portray the main character as a parody or as a biography.How many drug and sex inspired scenes can one endure in three hours, without getting bored by the repetition? After the first amusing hour, the movie goes over the top and hysterical and one can't help to be relived of the ramblings. The Wolf of Wall Street wants to be dramatic and funny at the same time but only achieves half of both. You'll get a few laughs out of it (mostly out of embarrassment) , but if this wasn't announced as a Scorsese in big letters, one would probably not think it's a Scorsese movie in the first place.Not 'bad' by any means, but under par for Scorsese."
sarahigley19,"Feb 24, 2022",6/10,"I had heard good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. My first thought was that this movie is long. I was prepared to watch this but with a runtime of 2 hours 59 minutes you need to really grab some snacks and prepare yourself.Prior to this movie I had never seen a Martin Scorsese film, but I have read things about his movies and I would say it's right on par with his other films in regards to women. I feel like women in this movie were treated more like set decoration than real people with a purpose to moving the story forward. We get it. He's a sex addict who cheats on his wife and likes strippers. I think it was a bit overdone.With that being said, I think the acting and the screenplay were top notch. The story was well written, it was directed well, the plot was interesting, etc. It was a fun watch and I think the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill was great. I feel like it was an unconventional team up that really added something to the film. I also hated the ending, but maybe that was what they were going for. It felt very unsatisfying.Overall, I enjoyed the story and the acting. I just feel like the runtime could've been cut down if some of the sex scenes were cut out. All in all, if excessive drug use and overdone nudity don't bother you much, it's worth the watch!"
imdbfan-620950,"Jun 30, 2025",9/10,"DiCaprio's performance is sharp and captivating, perfectly matching the intensity of the story. He brings Jordan Belfort to life with both charisma and volatility, making it hard to look away. The character is written with surprising depth, showing how charm slowly gives way to moral collapse.Scorsese's direction keeps the pacing tight without losing emotional weight, and the narrative never drags. It's visually amazing, with fast editing, bold color choices, and a style that amplifies the chaos.At the same time, the film manages to be both funny and emotionally moving in just the right moments."
cjmetcalfe,"Jul 30, 2021",10/10,"Yet again Scorsese blesses our screens with another portrayal of a 'one of a kind', entertaining lifestyle. The glamorous, inhuman life of Jordan belfort was demonstrated with the purpose of idealising the motivation and ambition Belfort undergoes, inspiring the audience. Dicaprio perfectly captivates the character of Jordan, depicting his growth as a person (gaining success and power) and battling the consequences throughout the late 80s, early 90s. Scorsese includes the thought of trends throughout that time, he creates a stylish, aesthetically pleasing movie. With the addition of Margot Robbie, the film takes a raunchy turn. Hill, Dicaprio's co-star, creates an amusing, comedic side to the story of the wayward tale. Similarly to Dicaprio his character experiences a rapid rise in wealth and success, the story shows how they both deal with this sudden change in life. Scorsese portrays this experience in a colourful, luxurious and fashionable manor. This is definitely one of Scorsese's best productions, the shots have been taken with an insightful intent, producing a unique perspective, cleverly designed to showcase the extreme wealth that is amongst this film. There is not one boring moment in this movie. You will be hooked. An all round 10/10 production."
TaylorYee94,"Mar 27, 2022",8/10,"It's hard not to be entertaining with all those nudity, drugs, and profanity. Scenes including those topics were clearly uncomfortable and obscene but I tried to understand them as the way of highlighting immorality, vanity, and corruption of Belfort. Narrative style and various ways of editing make 'The Wolf of Wall Street' more interesting. Editing moves the story speedy, so the whole movie does not feel lengthened even if it lasts three hours. Entertainment value is high, but there is no message, lessons, or emotions left; or it sends out even wrong message because this film does not cast light upon victims of Stratton Oakmont swindle even for a second."
ronald_2000-983-341993,"May 26, 2014",9/10,"the wolf of wall street is what is sounds like the story of Jordan belfort who arrives to wall street and tells how he gets to the top, DiCaprio made easily the best performance in his career, Jona Hill makes this movie funnier and even better, interesting plot, fresh and memorable moments, this movie kept me 100% in it, the drug sequences make it look so awesome and to be honestly i wanna try that stuff because of this movie (jk not really)but still you have to see this movie not with your parents nor grandparents but with your wildest friends for 3 hours, grab some drinks pop-corn get comfy and enjoy the ride 9/10-dicaprio approves"
Denno1972,"Jun 1, 2022",8/10,"Martin Scorcese, is the master of taking truly awful people and making them normal. Hell, he even makes them likable. In goodfellas we watch as drug dealers and gangsters brutally beat and murder each other and we are thrilled and entertained by it.It says so much, that although the premise here is similar, the main character is harder to root for, yes it's funny, occasionally thrilling with excellent performances (this is one of Di Caprio's finest jobs amongst great performances and Jonah Hill and Robbie provide excellent support) but ultimately for me, the main character and the situation is both abhorrent to the point it dampened my enthusiasm for what is a well made film. Overall, its good, rather than great Scorcese and was worth a watch."
suddenlysteve,"Dec 19, 2013",6/10,"It's unfortunate; I came into this movie with such high expectations that was sustained through the first 30 min of the movie, crashing right after in similar fashion to the stock market crash of the early 80s.You see, it's very similar to Goodfellas in it's narrative format. That aside, the movie is loosely tied by a plot reminiscent of Casino, holding together episodes of pointless bantering and ridiculous debauchery. The debaucherous episodes are fun, but the gratuitous sex and drug scenes honestly get tiring after awhile, since it seems they ran out of any compelling plot points.I expected Jonah Hill to be a little funnier. I sighed every time Leo was about to give a speech, I could see himself trying to hearken to Gordon Gekko's style of speech yet with a veinier more expletive filled delivery. Leo gave too many speeches. He hammed it up unnecessarily. At one point he went Daniel Day Lewis level type retarded and it became very clear this was the most disappointing ""try hard"" attempt for an Oscar I had seen outside of ""I am Sam""."
Daniel_behan,"Sep 4, 2018",9/10,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Mathew McConaughey and P.J Bryne. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie DiCaprio was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as alone is iconic"
bjhendo,"Feb 12, 2014",6/10,"Scorsese has made some of the all time great American films and many are my favorite films of all time . The Wolf Of Wall Street has many similarities to his 90's masterpiece films Goodfellas & Casino with much action and fast paced storytelling. Also he has borrowed some black humor from his 80's offbeat films The King of Comedy & After Hours.It's a magnificent performance by Leonardo Di Caprio but it's his Jordan Belfort character I don't like at all. I have adored other Scorsese male leads roles such as Henry Hill (Goodfellas ) , Ace Rothstein ( Casino) , Travis Bickle ( Taxi Driver) in controversial and violent movies they all are portrayed with an element of coolness and all you also have some compassion for.Belfort is really a smart arse cocky guy you can't stand and I have trouble liking .The Wolf Of Wall Street also lacks class and at times thought I was at a friends Bucks Party getting cheap thrills. I understand the direction is deliberately over the top for this over hyped character. There will be young film goers that will see this film thinking it's the baddest film of all time. With no respect to a Maverick DirectorI could write more and more about this film but Scorsese please just one last film with De Niro and Pesci.I still like this film but way to excessive"
brucecoughran,"Jan 26, 2014",1/10,"I really can't believe anyone likes this movie. It is an over-budgeted indulgence in offensive (intentionally, I think)...what I guess you would call ""soft porn""...that seems to have no point. The filmmakers seem to show the same contempt for the audience that the ""wolf"" shows to his clients. Throw a bunch of lewd, disgusting debauchery into EVERY frame, every scene, over and over again, and they will eat it up as if there was something there. But there is nothing there. There is no real story, no real character development, no real reason to watch these immoral characters indulge themselves. I truly felt traumatized, and with no that reason I could see.Unless you love porn, and senseless violence on every level, don't go see this movie. You deserve better."

A must watch movie and I really enjoyed.

jorge-zaz1973,"May 20, 2014",8/10,"Regardless the nearly 3 hour length may holes were left on the plot. Specifically what happens with the first wife? did they have any kids? same thing, they just killed the story without showing what actually happened to fat Danny and the other cronies. Would have loved to see less tits and more action (i.e. the Wolf closing business deals). The humor is so so too, not good enough to laugh out loud but bare good enough to make the 3 hours enjoyable. I have the impression that something was left, maybe a part 2? Things rushed once the Wolf & Danny were on the yacht in their way to Switzerland and had the accident. What happened with the Wolf's mentor? Did he just disappear from his life, it would have been nice to see him being headhunted by the Wolf's firm later on the film. Definitely worth the 3 hours, good value for your buck."

tengrc1106,"Jan 19, 2014",7/10,"Didn't have the charm of a typical Scorsese Movie. Leo did great but everything he does and almost the entire move feels one-dimensional. It lacks the depth that leads to deeper thinking and reflecting, which I'm sure Mr. Scorsese would love the audience to have. People all say Jonah Hill is great, but I'm not sure he can hold up such a big supporting role against Leo, with all due respect of course. I loved his small roles across the board which were all absolutely hilarious, but in this one, again, I think his role lacks depth too. All said, Matthew Mcconaughey is absolutely brilliant in his short appearance. I'm glad he and Leo both won Golden Globe, but I'm gonna have to go with him for the Oscar even though Leo is long due for sure."

I just didn't get it.The story is vaguely interesting but it is stretched atom-thin to encompass a ridiculous 3 hours!!Caprio and Hill give great performances but have very little to work with.The structure of the film is gratingly repetitive. * There will be a conversation on a taboo subject e.g. masturbation. * Someone gets their boobs out. * Someone gets wasted on drugs. * Caprio gives a rousing speech. * Repeat... for 3 hours!!Maybe I have become jaded but I don't find an ad-libbed conversation about throwing midgets particularly funny; not for PC reasons, it is just boring.Belfort seems to be a massive arse and I am sure he sits around his villa, watching this film about himself, chuckling about all the people he abused, betrayed and cheated."
ramonola,"Aug 30, 2018",N/A,"This is not Martin Scorsese's best effort nor is it even the best Scorsese- Di Caprio collaboration but that should not deter you from giving this film a shot. Its based on a real story and the typical Martin Scorsese style is prevalent all over- from the tracking shots to voice overs. Leo is in sublime form and is ably supported by a host of performers. I felt that the film was a tad bit overlong though and suffered from pacing issues at times. Still, if you want to watch a master at work you should go see this film."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"May 8, 2021",8/10,"Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio, playing a charismatic jerk. Really glad he and Martin found each other, they bring out the best in each other) is a stockbroker, with incredibly low morals, even by those standards. He finds ways to trick people into buying what he's selling, and quickly starts to make obscene amounts of money. How long can he possibly keep that going?If Scorsese has directed a bad film, then I don't know of it. Then again, I have heard that the Irishman feels like it takes as many years to watch as they deaged the leads by. While this one does substitute violence for debauchery, it does play a lot like one of his gangster biographies. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. No reason for him to stay away from his old bag of tricks. There's a lot of narration, since there are simply too many details to ""show, don't tell"" everything. Most of it voice-over, some of it breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the camera - occasionally it will be very Deadpool, even though this beat that movie to theatres by three years. We get quirky types of people(Margot Robbie was an excellent find, and it's really no wonder that she's been in as hot a name in Hollywood as she has been since this, despite some of them not being all that well received). Depicting very carefully approached lawbreaking, where we can understand how, and why, it works.I've heard some criticise these movies, saying that they romanticise these obviously unethical behaviours. Pointing out that a lot of attention to detail is put into showing the positive experiences they have specifically because of the awful things they do. My argument against that has always been that that's only the first chunk of these pictures. They are also very careful to show the eventual downfall. Unless you walk out early, clearly the message of these is that, though you might get away with it early on, in the long term it will destroy you and the people around you. In this flick especially, the way things gradually fall apart is a sight to behold. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine. Or that amazing dominoes bit from V for Vendetta. It's hard for me to overstate just how well constructed, and how fun to watch, it is. One sequence, dealing with a car, several phones, and some unforeseen consequences, made me laugh harder than I have at comedies for several years.This features a lot of nudity, sexuality, drug use and strong language, as well as some violence. I recommend this to anyone that the excellent trailer appeals to. 8/10."
Kingslaay,"Mar 17, 2017",8/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street takes an interesting look at the life of Wall street broker Jordan Belfort and his rise and fall. The film had and used some its ingredients to make a wildly entertaining film which included exceptional acting, great plot, narration, addictive soundtrack and the rise and fall of the central character in world of Wall street and finance. These elements have been used masterfully by Scorsese in former classics.Leonardo definitely deserved an Oscar for his performance as he lives the role of a shady Wall Street broker that is corrupted over his tenure as a stockbroker. The first person narrative works brilliantly as we are told Jordan's story. The portrayal of brokers is interesting as cut throat and money grabbing who use on it on all the vices life has to offer. The film excels at showing this lifestyle in excess from hookers, heavy drinking to living in mansions and sailing on yachts. Jonah Hill and the other cast and crew also hit some home runs to make it enjoyable and humorous at times. The achilles heel when it comes to the cast is easily Margot Robbie. While some of the world seems infatuated with her, she was unimpressive and mediocre. She was very annoying and Leonardo had to carry most of their scenes. The film would have benefited from another talented heroine who brought the best out of Leo and could meet his intensity in the scenes.While this is a great film it also had a few issues that stopped it from being an absolute classic. Scorsese can be creative when he makes his films but in this one it appears his creativity got the better of him and got ahead of itself. So instead of making a carefully coherent film like he has done before it is a film that incorporates unnecessary scenes, dialogue and screen time that distracts from the story. The result is a film that is 3hrs long and scenes that add no value to the plot. Scenes could have easily been reduced in length, the gay orgy scene could have been cut as could the scene with Brad living at his mothers and the list goes on. Cutting these scenes would have made this films great plot richer and less distracting. When I started watching this film I thought this was going be the greatest film Scorsese has ever made but the additional and unneeded scenes changed that. In my humble opinion this is what makes this a great film but not an Iconic film. An entertaining film but not legendary. A strong 8/10 that should have earned a few Oscars."
coreyisalover,"Nov 2, 2024",10/10,"Acclaimed master director Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' & 'GoodFellas') teams up with with producer and frequent collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio in this tale of greed and debauchery focusing on real-life stock broker and convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort in his rise to the top of the world of seedy Wall Street investing before his fall through the excesses of drugs and sex and illegal activities.In 1987, the money hungry Belfort (DiCaprio) finds work on Wall Street as an entry-level trader at a blue chip investment bank before the catastrophic Black Monday market crash leaves him out of work. Rebounding to Long Island to sell risky and largely unregulated ""pink sheet"" shares, Belfort teams up with business partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and a few other sales people to start his own brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont selling stocks to wealthy investors whilst rampant prostitution and drug-fuelled antics play out on the trading room floor and Belfort and his associates run an illegal pump-and-dump scheme to get rich off over-inflating stock prices. In the meantime, Belfort finds a new wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) who's relationship is tested and strained with Jordan's behaviour whilst FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) puts Jordan and Stratton Oakmont under the microscope with intense scrutiny.Whilst not quite at the same level as Scorsese's masterpieces, 'Wolf' is a quintessential film of his most recent filmography and is definitely his most funniest and outrageous film, whilst also serving as a cautionary tale much like 'GoodFellas' and 'Casino' borrowing their narrative structures and use of narration but replacing the visceral violence seen in those films with plenty of scenes depicting sex and drug use, along with a record amount of swear words (569 ""F-bombs"" were dropped in the film, a record which still stands for a widespread theatrical release).DiCaprio is perhaps at his best in this film playing the sleazy and narcissistic Belfort, whilst his co-star Jonah Hill delivers plenty of laughs and maintains excellent chemistry with DiCaprio in their scenes together. Margot Robbie in her breakout role as Naomi is a standout in the film and definitely one of the best casting choices in a Scorsese film, while Matthew McConaughey in a brief 5 minutes of screen time as broker-cum-mentor Mark Hanna also delivers an excellent performance that makes you wish he was in the film longer.'Wolf' is definitely a hilarious but also horrifying depiction of a man's greed that spirals out of control and costs him everything but nothing in the end, perhaps also reflecting on the audience of Belfort's outrageous tale still wanting to be like him."

juanantoniotobar,"Mar 13, 2020",10/10,"The wolf of wall street is a movie starred by Leonardo DiCaprio. This is a famous and great movie because of all the action and situations that happen along the story. It shows how at a moment the character is in a great moment and in seconds he is passing a really hard time. All the action and scenes in the movie is amazing.The movie is about Jordan Belfort(Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who is a middle class but who wants to get glory. He starts working on a big Wall Street company but the company goes broke so he has to go to a really small stock market company. In that small company he discovers that selling really bad products and telling the people that the products are great, he will get a really big profit. That's how he begins to win a lot of money and starts his own stock market company and gets really rich. But while all this happens, he lives some situations that makes his goal and life difficult.All the action that happened in the movie show how Jordan reacted to all his situations, how he could get wild and rage, how he spent and enjoyed all the money he won and also how he was intelligent to do really big things. Also all the action made the movie interesting and made you watch all the details. All the action made me concentrate all the time in the movie, also it showed me how an eccentric and really rich man lived his life and spent his money. Also it showed me how the richs enjoyed their life in the 90s.This is one of my favorite movies because it is really interesting and it tells a really great story, also shows that you need to make the right things or you will lose everything. I recommend it because it has really good actors, action, locations and is a really good and interesting theme."
Roozbeh-Kh,"Dec 13, 2020",6/10,After watching this Martin Scorsese is over for me. This movie is just another Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas without any novelty or sense of humour. 3 hours of torture for me.
emailonlytocomment,"Mar 3, 2023",6/10,"Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, like most of the time, was exceptional. Even Jonah Hill's acting was quite good (I was surprised there, as it was the first time I had seen his performance in a film with a more serious tone).But the shots in the film were extremely vulgar and disgusting, even a film from a porn site has more elegance than some of the scenes I watched in this movie.I was looking forward to watching this film because the director is Scorsese (who's great at his work) and because of the great fame it had in its time when it came out, but I must admit that I was extremely disappointed; I know that for the plot of the films, sometimes it is necessary to put graphic scenes, but this was grotesque and neverending. I can even express my disappointment at the fact that this film is considered a masterpiece. Overall, a fairly vulgar work."
leeswerge,"Jan 9, 2014",1/10,"This was like watching a cheap soft porn flick. The drugs were glamorized as if they were harmless, like crack being smoked as if it had no more harm than a cigarette. The sex was like watching a cheap porn flick, with full frontal female nudity in several scenes and the sex scenes left little to the imagination. The only thing not shown in the sex scenes was penetration. But the sex, too, was careless sex, like whores who use condoms, unless you pay them more, which is what he claims to do and then another statements when he went nuts over a beautiful woman, that he does not care if he gets aids from her, he just wants sex with her. This movie was recklessly and carelessly done for the younger viewers."
upquist,"Dec 26, 2013",N/A,"DiCaprio has proved himself to be one of the most versatile and engaging actors performing today. This movie is no exception.However, I have to agree with many of the reviewers who've made negative comments about the length of the film. It is, quite simply, much, much too long.I find myself wondering how this could have gone unnoticed by such a competent director. I couldn't wait to get out of the theater and I would have done so without waiting for the end had I not been sitting in the middle seat of a crowded auditorium. Sitting there to the end was actually painful.Moreover, during that last hour I found the scenes to be repetitive: the cocaine-snorting, the manic behavior , the parties, the shouting - all of it tiresome, tedious and incredibly boring and dull.This movie, while it has some great acting and truly funny scenes, will test your patience. I could never bear watching it again."

""Wolf"" gave a great insight into the stocks world for those of us not a part of it. It moves you to the point of being compelled to learn the Wall St. world and becoming a force of your own within the financial stratosphere. ""Wolf"" was also inspirational in the sense of depicting how you have no excuse to not succeed or not reach the top of your dreams. Such an unfortunate ending too; you really are brought to root for the underdog. DiCaprio truly impressed me, even after all these years.

denise-hasircioglu,"Feb 3, 2014",10/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street; a three hour long masterpiece. When I started it, I didn't know how long it was. A lot of the times I thought the movie plot had reached its end and that the credits were going to roll, yet I was shocked to find I was only half way through and there was still an hour and a half to go. It just continued to get better as you watched. I was glued to the screen all the way through and was mesmerized by Leonardo Di Caprio and his deserved Oscar winning role. I applaud his talent of multi genre acting, and how he managed to fit that all in one movie. He did so well I started to believe he was actually a filthy rich stock broker. Also Margot Robbie did an astounding job as Jordan Belfort's wife Naomi. Martin Scorsese deserves another Oscar. Him and Leo make the best team in many movies. Plus one that is based on a true story (and at the same time a book) is always promising. There was no way this movie could have gone bad, every way you look at it, its got the best actors, narration, camera work, and script and screenplay. Apart from the snorting of drugs every 5 minutes (which was unnecessary) it was a compelling, captivating film I give ten out of ten!"
burger1124,"Jan 31, 2014",8/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made by director Martin Scorsese. Unfortunately, it is not one of his best. Clocking in at a whopping 180 minutes, Wolf is too much of everything: sex, drugs, profanity, laughs, dialogue, improvisation, narration.If you've been following the development and release of Scorsese's latest, chances are you know all about the four-to-five hour, NC-17- rated cut that had to be trimmed down hastily for a Christmas day release. While legendary editor and Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is certainly not lacking in imagination, she and Scorsese let scenes run on entirely too long, cutting back and forth between actors who are clearly making it all up as they go along. Most of the time, the actors appear to be having a great time with the freedom they've been given by their director. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular, gives an absolutely fearless performance, and he is clearly enjoying himself. If only the audience had such a luxury.For its first hour or so, Wolf acclimates its viewers to its brisk pacing and no-holds barred storytelling. For the next hour and a half, however, the story falls victim to a ""rinse-and repeat"" method of constantly regurgitating its themes, scenes, and dialogue, until the inevitable ending provides some relief from its relentless pace.Wolf tells the story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street con artist who dreams of being a rich broker like Henry Hill dreamed of being a gangster in Scorsese's Goodfellas (more on the similarities between these two films later). After losing a promising job in the recession of the late 1980's Jordan learns the tricks (literally) of the trade at a small operation selling penny stocks. Whereas larger, more regulated stocks yield a much smaller commission, ""penny stocks"" provide a 50% commission for their brokers, who in turn sell an inferior product to gullible investors. Jordan's bright idea is to sell these cheap stocks in huge quantities to much wealthier clients, reaping a huge take for his new front-of-a-firm, Stratton Oakmont.Needless to say, the plan works for a while, and Belfort and his partners, including Donnie Azoff (played by a joyously weird Jonah Hill) become unfathomably rich. The remainder of the film is basically a visual orgy of gratuitous (and I mean ""I-can't-believe-they-got-away- with-this) sex and drugs, set against the backdrop of an FBI investigation into Belfort's dubious business practices.Perhaps the biggest issue I had with the film is just how gratuitous the edgy material was. Let us compare to a movie like Goodfellas, for instance. That film shows multiple murders, often with characters meeting their demise by gunshots to the head. It also features copious amounts of cocaine consumption, along with about as many f-bombs as you'll ever hear. However, one could make the argument that for the sake of the story, all of these elements are necessary in their fullness. When Henry Hill dabbles in unauthorized cocaine and arms dealing, especially after his best friend gets bumped off, the stakes become raised: one has the very clear understanding that in this world, one wrong move can result in death.The Wolf of Wall Street, on the other hand, shows relatively little in the way of consequences. For all the laws broken, all the drugs and hookers used up by the male characters, the biggest threat facing the supposed protagonists is possible jail time. A film that mimics the structure and feel of Goodfellas would do well to up the ante a bit, but Wolf falls woefully short in this regard.This is not to say that there are no consequences. Belfort's unraveling is spectacular, particularly in a late scene in which he tries to leave his mansion with his young daughter in tow. But after two and a half hours of debauchery, a small portion of comeuppance seems like a lack of balance—or poetic justice. This lack of justice is exactly Scorsese's point: for the vastly wealthy, there are often no tangible or justified consequences. Scorsese does a great job of not condemning or judging his characters—he simply shows them as they are, rather objectively, and they condemn themselves with their frat-boy antics. However, the director's overlong dive into a world of excess at times seems a somewhat unhealthy fascination.The debate over The Wolf of Wall Street is currently raging online. Variety is now running two pieces debating whether the film glorifies its characters' depravity. Some say this is Wolf's genius—an ambiguous presentation of both the temptations of sin and the obvious consequences of those who give in to it. Others would argue that people are giving Scorsese too much credit for what is ultimately an uneven tale with no dramatic drive. I count myself among the latter.There's a classic sequence toward the end of Goodfellas in which Henry lives in a constant state of paranoia—first as the result of his drug use and later because he has agreed to rat out all of his friends to join the Witness Protection Program. These scenes are key for the arc of the story—both to illustrate the dangerous stakes and to drive the narrative toward its conclusion. The Wolf of Wall Street should have had such a sequence. Instead, we were given just another scene with cocaine and sex."

Excellent cast, simply no bad acting across the board, especially remarkable Leonardo DiCaprio and Matthew McConaughey performances.

Maybe someday I'll decide to update the score to full 10."
pauldbwatkins,"Jan 12, 2014",9/10,"Martin Scorsese's latest offering The Wolf of Wall Street has divided audiences into two camps: those who praise the work as a masterpiece of cinematic verve, and those who say it glorifies white-collar crime along with the film's antihero, real life penny stock criminal, Jordan Belfort. While not quite the magnum opus some call it, I think The Wolf of Wall Street is an inspired parable and cinematic opera about greed, excess, and the perversion of the American dream.Hollywood, like the stock market, is big business, netting profits in the billions every year. In many ways, Hollywood is emblematic of the American dream; certainly the cinema is a place where we exchange money to watch our dreams, fantasies, and even nightmares unfold on a big screen in a dimly lit room. Scorsese, who often challenges Hollywood sensibility, continues to be one of American cinema's great dream makers and storytellers, gifting the world films like Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), and The Departed (2006).The Wolf of Wall Street continues Scorsese's fixation with crime, identity, and machismo, as well as his Roman Catholic concerns around guilt and redemption. However, unlike Scorsese's other gangster films there is hardly any graphic violence in Wolf, although there remains, perhaps more than any of his films, his liberal usage of profanity. It could be argued, and probably should, that Belfort's obsession with controlling women's bodies, as well as his betrayal of his victim's trust, is violence. The narrative techniques and do-it-yourself rise to power in Wolf parallels Goodfellas, but instead of mob bloodshed and revenge, Scorsese focuses his lens on robber baron, capitalistic sociopath, and real life penny stock criminal/self-made multi- millionaire, Jordan Belfort.For me, the film was a little like travelling through Dante's fourth circle of Hell (greed/avarice) for three hours, although I do admit that I laughed a fair bit, which is sort of the point of the grotesque parody. The Wolf of Wall Street is an irreverent and potent satire about greed, excess, and the perversion of the American dream. The writing is spot on, Scorsese's directing is inspired, providing lots of room for his actors to improvise, and DiCaprio gives the most dynamic performance of his career. Matthew McConaughey, who also gave a great performance in last year's Dallas Buyers Club, steals a scene in the movie. Some might feel the film glorifies greed. Jordan Belfort glorifies greed. America glorifies greed. The film does not. In some disturbing ways, Belfort was simply being American. As Belfort belts out in one of his many excessive speeches in the film: ""This right here is the land of opportunity. This is America. This is my home! The show goes on!""My full review available here: http://pauldbwatkins.com/2014/01/12/the-wolf-of-wall-street/"
baddah,"May 11, 2015",6/10,"I was so excited about this movie when released, Scorsese and DiCaprio teaming up again, a story taking place in Wall Street, what else to expect. I don't know why but it took me two years to watch it. And I am kind of ""Gosh, it could have waited more"". The reason is it doesn't tell you anything from a financial standpoint. All we see is a greedy broker who suddenly makes lots of money, parties all the time, and too much sex, sex and sex. I think the name should be changed to ""Sodom and Gomorrah All Over Again"" or something like that.The story doesn't clearly tells how Jordan Belford (DiCaprio) gets rich and climbs to the highs in Wall Str. We know he and his friends sell penny stocks and lead the IPO of SM women shoes, and that's it. It is never told how the penny stock mechanism works, or what happens to the people that trust Belford, and moreover he starts being ""Robin Hood for himself and his colleagues"" but are the rich that fool, do they just give away their money? Similarly, all of a sudden we see him lose everything, FBI investigation, wiring, everything getting out of hand, no story telling whatsoever.Jonah Hill does a perfect job. DiCaprio too much, overacting again. The speeches he gives in the company, for me, are too emotional, it looks more like a cult religious ritual than an ordinary speech to employees. Maybe they are not ordinary, maybe it is that stealing other people's money needs that kind of encouragement. Lastly, I think, the name of Martin Scorsese makes us expect something great, and this movie does not fit and come anywhere close to that expectation. It seems to me that the fantasies of somebody was pictured."

I believe there is a fine line but not quite Illegal.Jordan Sells shares to people who are a lot like himself. Greedy people who always want more for they're money. But what is greed? its only when you have lost something do you realise your being greedy in the first place. A price is what the market sustains, not the cost of the asset; and is driven by demand and supply, which in turn is driven by greed.This is a perfect example of share selling. It doesn't matter what the asset actually cost. What matters is how much money you can make from it, once you have covered that cost.A 10/10 film which DiCaprio does AMAZING to show that Jordan Belforts life was not glorified and that really, he was never happy nor satisfied."

Left after an hour and a half of nothing but drugs and debauchery. Worst movie I have ever seen, period. Nothing but Garbage. Had to apologize to my whole family. I was ashamed at myself for exposing my children to this level of sex and drug use. This movie will stop me from taking my family to the movies in the future. Ciniplex should be ashamed for showing this movie during the holiday season without lots more warning of how bad it is. It will be a long time till I go to the movies again myself.

BraveNewMovieStories,"Mar 1, 2021",9/10,"It is a bit long but I'm not one to shy away from films that last longer than the average run time. I mention it first because so many people complain about its length that they don't mention what Scorsese did with that time. For me, it was very engaging. For as long as it is, it felt like it was moving very fast. For the life in my, I will never understand why Leonardo DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I wouldn't call the film a masterpiece but I would definitely encourage every movie lover to watch it."
billygoat1071,"Jan 19, 2014",10/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street tells the story of Jordan Belfort's life in stocks. It depicts a world of rich people who are daily flooded with money but do not know what else to spend on other than their excess. That is just one side of the story, but that is what the audience is wholeheartedly focused on. It's not exactly only about a man who had done wrong choices then eventually learn by his mistakes in the end. It's more of a raucous portrait about rich people being petty, having way too much fun on their lust, never realized that they actually look terrible by it until they eventually become the worst of themselves. The overall film is enormously entertaining. It may bring relentless filth on screen, but the awareness comes right when things really get out of hand.There is nothing more important in their world other than money, sex and drugs. It is ought to be satirical, but one may think that it is taken too far, only when they take the comedy too seriously. The real plot here is Belfort's actual crimes in Wall Street. The film doesn't make those acts look much of a big deal. His victims are never shown because apparently the viewers should be rooting for him. It's almost just a series of outrageous parties, and schemes that will keep their fortune and pleasures going. Despite of their behavior, we are still obligated to care about these ""good guys.""The film somewhat comes close to Martin Scorsese's other film, Goodfellas. Aside of the throughout narration, the story has some similarities: a man who love affairs with a job that betrays both of his marriage and any moral standards, however the guy lacks the sympathy which defines the character's humanity. The main character's human figure here is all the negative sides. Compare him to the other goodfella, his motivations and striving are much petty, because of course, he has it all.Martin Scorsese makes it feels like a comedy which is kind of appropriate. It's swift and energetic, which thoroughly provides endless entertainment. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply terrific, from unhinged crawling to spilling charisma, he has made Belfort an effectively awful yet magnetic cinematic character you'll encounter in recent memory. His co-star Jonah Hill shares the same feat as his twice the arrogant, profane and half-witted pair. Also notable strong performance from Rob Reiner and Kyle Chandler. And for only few scenes, Matthew McConaughey steals all the ones that he is in.Everyone might think the ending is as much as inconsequential than it suggests; the point can probably be the ugly price of the person gets in the end is within himself, a perfect life won't fix a broken man, or misusing cash and power will always cause a lot of trouble. There is many suggestions about its themes. But in the end, Jordan Belfort is just a another man in the community who is blinded by the typical extreme lust and fortune, and for sure anyone would get the same condition if they ever get to taste its pleasures. In spite of treating everything as a joke, the film suddenly becomes compelling. That's the kind of trick it has. Anything else, The Wolf of Wall Street is just insanely fun. Even for its lengthy runtime, it's able to be very enjoyable every minute of it."
in1984,"Jan 12, 2014",9/10,"9.1 of 10. It's hard to criticize a film about it's length that is great and part of its greatness is its satirizing of excess, making the length part of the story. Length, however, and a few other things that could have been cut or given more thought prevent this from being perfect. For example, McConaughey, either just before or just after his award-deserving performance in another award-deserving film, Dallas Buyers Club, is miscast. He doesn't need to be in this film and he looks like an underfed, homeless man in a suit. That said, if you can ignore his appearance and misplaced accent, he, like all the cast, does give a wonderfully amusing performance.I definitely won't complain if this gets awards.For DeCaprio, this is a wonderful complement to his role in The Great Gatsby. In fact, he fits into this character far better. It would be wrong to call it ironic, but his role here is an inversion of essentially the same character he played in Gatsby.As for capturing reality in a film based on true, possibly somewhat enhanced, story, it's nearly impossible to find flaws. Because of the lack of cutting, there is at times some sympathy developed for characters that shouldn't be getting any empathy. I would have also made some different soundtrack choices for a film set in the late 1980s/early 90s.Overall, however, it's an exotic use of time that captures aspects of lesser films this year (I'm thinking Blue Jasmine and All is Lost) all into one masterpiece so you don't have to watch them. If you haven't seen American Psycho, however, be sure to see that. That will help you enjoy the truth is bizarrely similar to fiction elements of this film."
ElMaruecan82,"Mar 19, 2016",10/10,"""Why don't you boys go down to Wall Street and find some real crooks?""This is Tuddy Cicero speaking to the FBI men while they arrest his brother Paulie near the end of ""Goodfellas"". It's very revealing when 'ordinary' gangsters believe they don't hold a candle to the Wall Street guys. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the Goldman Sachs and Madoff scandals, it's hard to prove them wrong. 23 years later, Martin Scorsese, the greatest gangster movie director, finally did justice to Cicero's words and took on the 'bigger players', through his adaptation of Jordan Belfort's autobiographical book.Jordan Belfort is a guy who, as far back as he could remember, always dreamed of making money and found an easier way than being a gangster: he became a trader. He wasn't more handsome or charismatic than Henry Hill (as portrayed in the films), he just studied and got the passport to Wall Street. He could do what Hill did in all legality proving Al Capone's quote that ""Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class"". In fact, he almost made the Goodfellas look closer to Robin Hood figures, at least, they bribed a few working-class men.""Goodfellas"" was craftsmanship compared to what these 'wolves' in Armani's clothing did: elevating theft to an industrial level, about making millions in a few hours, and money out of virtually nothing, which is the essence of finance. It reminded me of these courses in business schools teaching how to make risk-less money through arbitrage. What Belfort makes is more straightforward, he sells worthless action to blue-collar people and then, it's the traditional supply-and-demand rules, the more people buy, the more others want to buy, the value increases and when it goes high enough, you sell. What then happens to your client is besides your concerns.Call it unethical, cynical or criminal, but this is the world's holistic system. And the only talent that can make you rich quicker than talented and deserving people is being a good salesman. Because, when you have to sell ****, just sell dreams. A good trader sells securities and buys capital, he sells promising values and makes real money, and it takes some communicative skills to make that possible. And that's the key to these characters' ""likability"", by cinematic standards; they know how to communicate their appeal, that's the 'Gekko' syndrome.The screenplay, written by Terence Winter, is full of these pep-talk speeches echoing the famous ""Greed is good"" tirade and we have such motivational ones as ""there's no nobility in poverty"" (also borrowed from Oliver Stone's film). ""Wall Street"" set the tone for the financial-themed movies, and there's a reason these films fascinate us: we all love money, we all dream of being rich, if we dream of something else, it's liable to have wealth in the process. There's no potential dream that doesn't involve in a way or another, sex, money or power, these movies speak to us, in a very personal level.I often found myself thinking that an average guy must make money to have sex with a beautiful girl, and a beautiful girl can get a rich guy easier than an average one. The film made me understand why: basically, a man's main currency is the money he makes, even if you don't dream of banging hot girls, you won't earn your nagging wife's respect if your pockets are empty, and a woman's currency is her beauty, her body and her willingness to use them. Not only Margot Robbie's frontal nudity is not shocking, but it's also a necessity. When you have these guys indecently throwing lobsters, wiping their ass with paper bills or harassing flight attendants, it's just their money language, they can get away with it. Full nudity is the woman showing her best asset in that decadent world, it's a fair trade.And only Scorsese could have portrayed such loathsome and amoral characters with that flamboyant, dizzying and electrifying style. The characters are sleazy, have nicknames as pathetic as their intentions, as if behind every trader, there was a crook sleeping, but they strangely appeal to us. There Scorsese's obligatory morally corrupt protagonist rising high to fall hard, a multiple-time sinner who's given a few moments of redemption but won't go until the sun really burns his wings. Leonardo Di Caprio finally brings a performance where he can show a wide range of emotions, be charismatic and pathetic within the same five minutes and the credits also go to the gripping realism of the portrayal of cocaine, crack and Quaalude uses.No movie ever portrayed drugs and lust, and the combination of both in such a straight-forward way, and that was essential because there's got to be a catch behind such a dreamy lifestyle. This ambivalence goes further as the title was borrowed from an unflattering portrait of the young yuppie go-getter, yet it gave him the perfect publicity to build his reputation. Did things change much? After he cooperated with the FBI, he served a few years in prison and became a motivational speaker. In the film's closing scene, you can see people looking at him with respect and adoration. The joke is on us.From Leo to the surprisingly good Jonah Hill as his right-hand man Donnie Azoff, from Matthew McConaughey as his first tutor, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent or Jean Dujardin as the suave and crooked Swiss banker, the film is some actors' finest hours, and that includes Rob Reiner as Leo's father and the promising Margot Robbie. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Scorsese back to his roots and one of his best.And what a cruel injustice that Roger Ebert, Scorsese' number one fan, who loved every single film he made with Leo and adored ""Goodfellas"", didn't live up to see the culmination of the actor/director's duo and the film in the same vein of greatness than its glorious predecessor."

Littered with Stars, directed to perfection, full of humour and still somehow semi-educational on the financial aspects of the plot. Only rivaled by the big short (with Christian Bale).
The only downside of this movie is the blatant advertisement of heavy drugs. I get it that the quay loods seemed like a fun story element, but smoking crack for fun??? Well,if that doesn't bother you, enjoy this movie. It's real good :)"
westpenn49,"Apr 6, 2014",1/10,"This was about the most unredeemable movie that I can remember. The acting was over the top with only a few bit players turning in good performances Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma comes to mind. Jordan Belfort tells his tale of excess without remorse or humor. I sincerely hope that he had a few sober moments in the late 80's and early90's where he accomplished something good, he doesn't seem to remember any of it. Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past. This movie is at best an extended drug flashback, one which has nothing to say about the human condition other than that Mr. Belfort and friends were degenerate. I knew that coming in and gained mo insight other than to be skeptical if I ever meet this guy in the future.Save your money save your time even Fox News has more to offer."
mishmashmoo,"Apr 7, 2014",9/10,"The Wolf of Wall Street is exhibition of excess, greed and the perversion of the American dream, it's deeply honest and darkly humorous story of the rise and fall of the infamous Wall Street stockbroker Jordan Belfort. DiCaprio comfortably steps into the shoes of the ruthless wolf 'Jordan Belfort' he quickly transitions from a naive intern to a ruthless, amoral Wall Street tycoon. He goes for lunch with a senior stockbroker to learn that the industry is really just a zero-sum game. No one really knows which stocks are going up and down and no one wins but the broker - all that matters is whether you can sell. Jordan Belfort is the poster boy for everything Wall Street doesn't want us to know.Wall street is depicted to be a world of animalistic instincts where only the ruthless survive. The employees at Stratton Oakmont are often beating their chests like monkeys, chanting in a ritualistic manner, having sex in front of each other and pissing in the offices. The office truly is a wolf pit, where man is enslaved by his primal instincts. Testosterone is in the air, fueling aggressive confrontation and impulsive behavior; in one scene Jonah Hill's character eats another employees goldfish in front of him to assert his dominance. Belfort and his co-workers increase their wealth in equal measure to their hedonism and quest for instant gratification. Cocaine and sedatives called 'Ludes' become as commonplace as coffee, a seemingly necessary part of life as a stockbroker in the 80s. The film is laced with moral questions; even more pertinent in today's economic climate Scorsese makes us ask ourselves how much is too much?The film often feels like a series of darkly humorous anecdotes. At times it can feel like it is missing a direction or any real plot. Only in the last third of the film does a solid plot start to develop with the long awaited arrival of an antagonist. However, the plot is not what makes this film great - it's the depth of the characters, The Wolf of Wallstreet should be viewed as a character study of a man corrupted by wealth and in that respect it excels.I was expecting DiCaprio to blow me away with a performance worthy of an Oscar, but instead I found myself pleasantly surprised at the intensity of Johan Hill's performance. My previous experience of him playing a similar version of the same character led me to believe that he was a one trick pony and made me question whether he could pull off such a complex role However, Jonah proved his diversity as an actor and brought the character 'Donny' to life with a powerful performance, sparking intensely funny scenes with his natural comedic flare. He was reportedly only paid $60,000 for his supporting role, choosing to work on the film because of his respect for Scorsese. Despite being paid much less than DiCaprio, Jonah arguably gave a better performance and deserved to win an Oscar for best supporting role.9/10"
shivam-hora,"Mar 24, 2014",10/10,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. The 70 something director known for his amazing projects like good fellas , the departed and many others has directed this movie of the same pattern as of good-fellas , which is first person narrative combined with third person story telling. The film offers us a tub full of jokes and comedy scenes delivered beautifully by the whole star-cast, Leo, Jonah and Patrick Denham.The movie has even made an amazing selection of special appearances like Matthew and Jean Dujardin. I was really shocked when Leo didn't win the Oscar , because this time he deserved it more than ever.So the movie in a nutshell is a full package, combing amazing story telling, with stupendous performances and beautiful direction.WATCH IT !"
phd_travel,"Jan 10, 2014",10/10,"This excellent true story comedy of a wall street hotshot downfall is laugh out loud funny. It's well written, over the top at times about the drugs sex and excess but it's comically so and relevant to the story. The way the dialog is written and the way the scenes played out is fresh and witty. The scene with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler on the boat is hilarious. So is the drive back from the country club. Doesn't feel draggy even though it's nearly 3 hours long because the story moves along and the characters are sympathetic.The casting is terrific. Leonardo demonstrates some good comedic delivery without overacting even if the scenes and dialog are a bit exaggerated at times. It's good he isn't playing a more familiar person so you don't have to deal with him not looking much like Howard Hughes or J Edgar Hoover. Jonah Hill has some hilarious moments that he pulls of well like the cousin conservation. Margot Robbie is quite good as the poster second wife. The European supporting cast is perfect - Jean Dujardin as a sleazy Swiss Banker is spot on as is Joanna Lumley as the English aunt. Wonder why Matthew McConaughey is skinny and haggard for this movie as well.Liked it more than American Hustle. Good to have a comedy about Wall Street crooks to contrast with the more serious Wall Street 2 and the recent documentaries. It doesn't glamorize drugs rather it shows the effects. Good warning about the dangers of penny stocks."
lasttimeisaw,"Jun 12, 2014",8/10,"After dumping his longtime companion Robert De Niro for the hey-day Leonardo DiCaprio in the naughties, Martin Scorsese embarks on a series of ambitious enterprises to earn his overdue Oscar statuette, finally third time is a charm, THE DEPARTED (2006, 8/10) achieved that goal, but poor Leo is still Oscar-less, so their fifth teamwork is THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, an excessive satire of Jordan Belfort's autobiography, a former Wall Street stock-broker's rise and fall from 1980s to 1990s, which grants Leo the uppermost leniency to embody this corrupted, decadent and indecent character with inordinate excess and extravaganza, unfortunately, Leo's time has yet arrived.Running around 180-minutes, the film is ultra-snappy and the camera faithfully acts in accordance with the doped delirium where Jordan (DiCaprio) and his cohorts habitually reside, it is an out-and-out wealth-flaunting satire, periodically overreaches its boundary with benumbing and slightly off-putting repletion since Jordan's hollow life perpetually orbits around money, sex, drugs and drug-addled misdemeanors. Marty doesn't trouble himself to go deeper than that, the trenchant point is, Jordan is no more than an eloquent salesman and a shallow opportunist, luck is on his side at the right time, but he fails to apply a failsafe mechanism to get away with it, ironically, it is the American judicial system let him slide, all the more it incites audience to detest the hypocritical political body of democracy, which is inadequate in its wealth distribution and justice upholding.Leo's performance is voraciously full of vim and vigor, he devotes every effort to light up the screen with incredible body language and pitch-perfect accuracy with beguiling pomposity, but, an indelible impression is that with every gesture he poises, every line he delivers, simultaneously he is thinking of that damn Oscar, he even makes Jordan lovable and immensely watchable, it is his charisma, not his character's, which may bar him from winning in the race this year.Two-times Oscar nominee (alas!) slash red-hot comedy actor Jonah Hill, not a fan of his performance in MONEYBALL (2011, 6/10), there is no big stretch for him to showcase his prowess as a serious thespian here, he is uproarious and cheeky as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's best buddy, like in his other more coarse comedies, the only difference is this is a Marty's filmHaving said that, a preciously meaty part is when Donnie is choking and Jordan tries to save him, but we can vicariously detect in one blink Jordan thinks it might be good to let him die. This is one of Marty's masterstrokes to reflect the complexity of human's intuitive caprice.New starlet Margot Robbie consummates her big screen breakthrough as Naomi Lapaglia, the second trophy wife of Jordan, she intermingles her utterly stunning sex appeal with aggressive fervor, which might bring to mind Sharon Stone in CASINO (1995, 7/10). Coincidentally, Leo's Oscar rival and eventual winner McConaughey (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB 2013, 7/10) has a ten- minutes screen time as Mark Hanna, the one who remarks on the golden criterion in the Wall Street business, McConaissance is irrepressible even for such a small role. It could be Leo's idea to curtail the role of Mark in the film in order not to lose the spotlight of his own. Also I must extol Spike Jonze's unexpected cameo which offers some imaginable salaciousness with his tacit smirk.Marty has already risen to a lofty echelon of a cinema maestro who can apply himself to manifold genres with top-notch dexterity, which his recent works HUGO (2011, 9/10), SHUTTER ISLAND (2010, 8/10) all potently bespeak. At the age of 72, the night is still young, may his outstanding creativity will never peter out, which is a tremendous blessing for all the children of cinemas."

In that sense the movie captures really well this descent into the craziness.The topic of the movie is also very real and tangible with what is happening today , how many people are all this much clouded by this fake dreams and pyramidal schemes that so many people are selling at every corner . i m not gonna name some ""companies"" but we all know some people in those "" supposing"" amazing business conference and system ready to be one day millionaire  are we not addicted to money ?yet eventho there are so many things i love about this movie , and so many sequences are in the best acting and well made scenes I've seen this year, they are all but shallow , drawn into one vice that is too predominant , sooo predominant that it becomes bothering , in fact , many people left the movie so overthetop it was . yes i m talking about ""DEBAUCHERY"" .you can understand to make this point since it is in fact one of the main reason this movie is made , to contemplate on those vices consuming this man. i m not especially a puritan either , i usually don't mind the sex and drugs its not so much of a factoryet in this movie i think that it was way too muchthe movie is easily 30 min more than it needed to be , just because its filled with Sex and Drugs at every corner  a little of it is fine , a little more is even OK  but in this movie i think there isn't 5min passing when this is the main topic .so i get it i get it , its on purpose that the director decided to make u understand this excess that this man actually is . he is the embodiment of excess ... of everything , money , drug , sex . but At the end of the day , the wall street hustle movie is not that anymore . all it is , is a movie about people getting high , and having sex every 5minutes. "" sex is sooo awesome ,,,,, i love getting high , get me something even stronger  i m high : ahahahahaah ,,, ahahaha i do crazy things , ahahah i m high . hahaha this is so cool  i m so funny i m crazy because i m high . "" --->>>> that basically it 90% of the movie .i really felt like the movie was insulting my intelligence , did he think we didn't get this excess unless they shove it into our throat ""until we choke"" ??? are they taking me for a pre-puberty ado ???so you know after a couple of minutes i was tired of it  it ruined it  the plot the story , all of it just started to be blurred and mixed up with this constant flow of debauchery that drawn the movie. Since when did we have to have so much sex and drug to understand this point ??instead of being the movie of the year , to me it became an average moviein short , i think the potential and amazing part of this movie was sadly nullified by the excess of vulgarity  too much is fine , but once you cross the border of ""over"" too much .. this is when it becomes not enjoyable anymore  it is only annoying what a shame sad day.peace."
robrmcc,"Jan 7, 2014",1/10,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. Bloated, self indulgent, lacking in story line and plot. No idea why everyone seems to like it unless they just really enjoy watching men be totally disgusting for 3 hours because that is all there was to it. And I am a man who does not mind getting disgusting once in a while. I am no prude and not easily offended but this was like watching porn. Once you see the first orgasm in the first 10 minutes its 170 minutes of all the same after that.There was what could have been a moderately interesting subplot about a straight arrow FBI agent chasing the ""Wolf"" around which might have been slightly interesting in a seen that 10 times before way but it amounted to nothing.It is a bit disturbing how Scorcese glorifies the use of drugs, degrades women to nothing more then F@#$bags as they say in the movie, shows wife abuse and child abuse with no consequences and shows all the morally conscious people as ugly, dull boring individuals. You can say he is just telling a story, but he can tell any story he wanted to and decided to tell this one, so what does that say about him?A clear case of no one wants to say anything bad about a Scorcese movie. I really can't think of anything good to say about it."
buckbeasom,"Dec 26, 2013",N/A,"It would be impossible for me to write a spoiler in this review, as I walked out after an hour.Basically, this movie is about a shameful, conscious-less prick who has surrounded himself with an assortment of losers who are quite content to emulate him in the pursuit of money at the expense of anyone who is unfortunate enough to cross their paths. In Goodfellas and The Departed, Scorsese showed us equally unsavory people, but those films were redeemed by having - at least - great dialog, engaging characters and a decent story line.""Wolf"" has none of these things. It's as if Scorsese dropped acid and decided to make a movie about people who lack any redeeming values whatever - and celebrate the fact every day. There are no characters you care about, no story line of even the remotest interest and - frankly - no reason to bother watching this mess.The problem with today's movie business is that about 90% of the movies made are targeted at the ""14 year old boy"" demographic. Thus Thor, Enders Game and all of the rest of the crap that clogs up the cinema universe.""Wolf"" is not just aimed at 14 year old boys, but at DEPRAVED 14 year old boys. If you get the urge to go to this movie, just take the ten bucks out of your pocket and wipe your butt with it. You'll get the same result and save yourself the three hours.(BTW, after walking out, I was lucky enough to stumble into American Hustle. Now THERE is a movie worth watching.)"

hasankalamis,"Nov 14, 2024",9/10,"Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is a chaotic, exhilarating journey into the heart of financial excess, where greed knows no bounds. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of his best performances, capturing both the charm and the madness of Jordan Belfort, a man who thrives on risk and revels in his own delusions. The film's fast-paced narrative, combined with Scorsese's razor-sharp direction, creates an intoxicating mix of humor, drama, and moral recklessness. With bold performances, a memorable soundtrack, and a story that's as outrageous as it is compelling, The Wolf of Wall Street is a bold commentary on ambition, power, and the corrupting influence of money."
sjohnson134-878-955038,"Jan 20, 2014",6/10,"The 2013 film of Jordan Belfort's The Wolf of Wall Street novel begins with Leonardo DiCaprio breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience. He does this repeatedly throughout the film and if he is not speaking directly to the audience, he is doing lots of voice-over to explain or inform what he or the other characters are doing at that particular time/situation in the film. Most of the time, I find voice-over very distracting, but I have to admit that it works in this dramedy film very well. The book, written by Jordan Belfort, a former New York stock broker who earned hundreds of millions of dollar during the 1990s at his Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm on Long Island, New York (not really Wall Street in downtown Manhattan). The book is very long and seems to glorify everything Belfort did during this time of his life along with all of his friends and co-workers at his stock firm. He founded this firm which started as a penny stock firm, where unfortunately he defrauded everyday ordinary investors with fraudulent stock sales. Considered a stock swindler, he developed a very severe lifestyle, which included a very serious addition to Quaaludes. The company at one point employed well over 1,000 brokers and dealt with more than $1 billion stocks, including the Steve Madden show company. The 2000 film Boiler Room was inspired by Belfort and Stratton Oakmont. It should be noted here that Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud. He spent 22 months in a federal prison and was to pay back $110.4 million that he swindled. Meeting Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong in prison, Belfort was persuaded to write and publish his story, which he has. Stratton Oakmont was considered a boiler room that manipulated stocks. In the book, he tells in full detail how he did it from money laundering to swindling customers. Millions poured in, bringing with it many excesses, which included women, drugs, huge homes, servants, yachts, aircrafts, not only for himself but for everyone who worked for him. He also describes in detail all his dope escapades and sex, despite constantly telling the reader how much he loved his wives, particularly his second (and now ex-wife) and his children. Again, in full detail, he tells the reader about the supporting characters, from Aunt Patricia, his father who he calls Max Max, the Swiss forger, his cohorts in crime at Stratton, along with Steve Madden and others. The drug use, the sex, the violence, the storm at sea that destroyed his yacht, and the car wrecks are all listed throughout the book. It finally ends with Belfort being arrest and jailed. In the film, which is considered a black comedy, the story deals with the scam that Belfort initiated and where, or not, some, any, or all of what he tells the reader what he did during this time in the book is accurate remains to be seen. As is always the case with any film, plenty of creative license is used to tell a particular story. Seeing how Martin Scorsese, the director, in all his films, tries to be as faithful to the novel as he can be, he has done the same with Belfort's memoir. So this particular film is a close adaptation since most of the story elements are kept while some have been changed, added, or dropped. But, one has to be reminded that Belfort was a true scam artist, so just how much of his story is legit is up to the reader and now the watcher to decide. Most of what Scorsese has included in this film is accurate based on the book. Mark Hanna, played well by a still very thin Matthew McConaughey from his role in Dallas Buyer's Club, tells a very young Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) that the key to being successful included hookers, cocaine and masturbation is told in the novel. The use of what is called a pump-and-dump scheme (selling a risky stock at an inflated price and then sold the stock to make a profit for themselves) to make a profit is also accurate. Belfort and Danny Porush (Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill) did this. The brokerage firm did in reality take Steve Madden's shoe company public, which Madden, Belfort and Porush owned the stock, driving the price up. All three of them went to jail for this. The smuggling of the money that Belfort laundered in Switzerland was actually done by his wife's mother and English aunt. Prostitutes were hired and were billed to the corporate credit card and then these expenses were written off their taxes. The yacht, originally owned by Coco Chanel, was sunk. In the film, his second wife's name was Naomi; in the novel, her name is Nadine. In the book, Belfort gave up Porush, among many others for a reduced sentence. In the film, he tells Porush not to incriminate himself. It is true that Belfort was born in the Bronx to accountant parents and he was raised Jewish which he is still today. I guess the audience would like to believe that Belfort only stole from the rich. Truth be known, many small investors are still to this day trying to recover from his scheme while Belfort has failed to repay what he owes and Porush is still doing his get rich quick plans. Many of the characters; names from the book were changed. Danny Porush is Donnie Azoff, Patrick Denham (FBI agent) is in real-life Gregory Coleman, Denise Lombardo was changed to Teresa Petrillo and Nadine Caridi was Naomi Lapaglia. Chandler was the name of his first child, but was referred to in the film as Skyler. Scorsese did include at the end of the film a disclaimer saying it was a fictionalized version of the novel and in the film, some of the names had been changed."
barber-937-20950,"Jun 5, 2014",10/10,"when i first watched this movie months ago, i wasn't really sure what to expect. then, after watching the first 45 minutes i was completely blown away. this is easily my favorite movie, being the only movie I've like so much as to watch a second time immediately after the first. I read both of the books, in less then two weeks. Sure, they aren't the same as the movie, but honestly if your going to try and use that to say the movie was bad, then gtfo. I keep reading these reviews, such as this guy named Luci1977, who say, ""don't waste your time!"" or ""the movie has no connection to Jordan belfort's life."" I mean common seriously. None you have ever met him, and you act like you are best friends. I mean if you have, that's great, but your still a prick. Do seriously think that Belfort cares if the movie matches his life? Do you know how much he's making off of that movie?! So go look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself your not an actual movie critique, because your not. sorry. better luck next time. This is a great movie, it hilarious, and i recommend you see it. That is if your older than 17 of course.(lol boobs)"
drojan,"Dec 19, 2013",7/10,"It is always difficult to properly review legendary directors. There always comes a point where movie-making trends and styles have passed them by or the creative juices have simply stopped flowing. This is the case for Scorsese, at least by judging The Wolf of Wall Street.All of his hallmarks are put to good use in the film. The immediacy and visual assault of the cinematography in particular was exceptional. The dark comedic touches are put to the forefront to great effect. I don't recall ever laughing out loud at Scorsese film before, but there are many such moments here.The story itself is one of the oldest movie clichés, man overcomes humble beginnings, becomes wealthy, is seduced by money and power, is consumed by his excesses and ultimately redeemed.The performances are intentionally bombastic and over the top and greatly add to the theme of excess. Jonah Hill especially loses himself in the role and delivers a lot of laughs and some depth to an otherwise shallow and one dimensional character. DiCaprio, while convincing as charismatic and flawed Jordan Belfort, grew tiresome over the course of the film as his character flies directly into the sun and then spectacularly crashes and burns.Unfortunately the theme of excess extends to the length of the film as well; it is simply way too long. I felt like I was watching a director's cut in the theater. I know the general trend in movies today is longer run times, but at almost 3 hours it is just too much. What should be a highly entertaining two hour wild ride just drags in some places. The outlandish action and comedy scenes lose their bite in the last half of the film as the viewer is just numb from the assault at that point. The dramatic scenes are not well thought out and did not establish an emotional connection with the characters and their downfall as I should.All in all, a very enjoyable, exciting film but it misses the mark in characterization and left me wanting less bombast and more meat in the story. I see an aging director trying to stay relevant and not wanting to make compromises this movie badly needs."
Bob_the_Hobo,"Dec 25, 2013",N/A,"Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ambitious young Wall Street numbers-cruncher, working under an equally ambitious (though decidedly more corrupted) stock broker named Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey). Things are going well until Hanna's firm goes under, leaving Belfort to create his firm. Belfort throws together some sleazy characters (Jonah Hill, Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal) to create a large securities fraud investigation-in-waiting, finally forcing him to use his conscience to decide between an extravagant life or a way out for himself.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a nightmare, for both the characters and the viewer. A script that can't fit itself into coherence drones on and on about corruption, while never seeing fit to inform the viewer of exactly how Belfort became what he is. He just, is. We never learn much of anything about him. Nudity, drugs, and violence corrupt his despicable life. And that's what the movie is. In many ways, I would have learned more from watching a documentary about Belfort than watching this movie.For a Martin Scorcese picture, especially one written by Boardwalk Empire scribe Terrence Winter, I was shocked at the utter one- dimensionality of these characters. Belfort is a scumbag. Each and every one of his cronies are equally scummy. The only characters who seem to have any benevolence are Belfort's first wife (despite her many scenes, we never learn her name) and the FBI Agent pursuing the fraud, Kyle Chandler. Chandler might have had a name. If I saw the word ""Cop"" across from his name at the cast and credits, I wouldn't be surprised.By far the worst part of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the structure. The end result looks like someone took scissors to the reel and haphazardly pasted the final third together. It's a complete mess, trying to force all the character development we didn't get for the first TWO HOURS into the final chapter.The only character who was at all interesting was McConaughey's, who as a powerful broker who loses it all perhaps served as the heaviest foreshadowing the film could offer. Yet we lose track of him after the first twenty minutes, and by the time you're numb from the waist down and your brain is turning into mush, you've completely forgotten McConaughey was ever there.Scorcese and DiCaprio should be ashamed. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a disaster that engages its audience through the type of stuff I'd expect in a Uwe Boll film."

Leonardo Dicaprio is great as Jordan Belfort.I love Jonah Hill in it, but i love him in every movie he's in.The cinematography is great.I love this movie and i think everyone should watch it. 10/10."
Pushpam_1337,"May 2, 2022",10/10,"I don't know where to begin to review this epic of a movie. I would like to give this movie 10 out of 10 stars or maybe more than that.Characters are represented brilliantly by all of them. Leonardo Dicaprio was great as always! He deserved an Oscar for his brilliant performance. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also played their part really nicely. It is one of my favourite movies directed by Martin Scorsese.Wolf of Wall Street is a rollercoaster ride which takes Jordan Belfort from nobody to a rich man and one of the best sales traineers in the history. This movie was inspiring and I enjoyed Belforts character. He is clever, bold, risk-taking. He has a chill-out attitude and effective leadership skills, which are the most liked traits of mine from his character.The movie also showed that some people in our life might show us a complete new different direction which may brings positive or negative impact in our life, like in the movie Mathew guided Belfort how to earn more money, how to deal with the customers. This leaded a significant change in Belforts personality."
agnese-43207,"Apr 22, 2021",10/10,"In this movie Leonardo Di Caprio offers us one of his best interpretations. Fantastic movie, every scene keeps you glued to the screen, with attention to the smallest details. The actors in the film are all very good."
Assassin24k,"Mar 26, 2021",10/10,One of the best films ever made and very tounching!
r96sk,"Mar 14, 2021",9/10,"I didn't care for the characters, but I damn did have a great time watching 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way.Leonardo DiCaprio simply never puts an acting foot wrong, this is the sixth film I've seen of his and I love (fwiw: all 9/10+) them all. Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.Jonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, 'Moneyball'. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.The almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive. It doesn't, as I've already mentioned, breed likeability for the characters but I definitely had a fun time watching it all unfold. I guess it depends on what you, as a viewer, prefer. I got the desired amount of entertainment."
Ser_Stephen_Seaworth,"Dec 25, 2013",10/10,"Bacchus, Roman god of wine and debauchery, is alive and well and has been brought to raunchy life by Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's latest film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". His human incarnation is Jordan Belfort, a fast-talking financial kingpin whose balls-to-the-wall lifestyle of sex and drugs and rolling in dough would make Gordon Gekko take a step back and reassess his lifestyle.And for what seems to be the first time, Scorsese's decade-long collaboration with DiCaprio has finally paid off. Because ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", written by ""Sopranos"" scribe Terence Winter, is a far cry from the polished but lifeless films that Scorsese, master that he is, has been pumping out of late. It is perhaps his most energetic film since ""Gangs of New York"", his cleanest (in craftsmanship, though certainly not in content) since ""Goodfellas"". Instead of wise-guys and low-rent mobsters, ""Wolf"" is about the sharks that swam in the seas of the 1%, ripping into their prey with gusto while coming at them with smiles.Set in the '80s and '90s, Scorsese depicts a glitz-and-chintz world ripe for the taking for any ambitious youth who wanted to make a name for himself. Enter Belfort, a fresh-faced twenty- something who starts on the bottom rung at one of the many firms in Lower Manhattan. He quickly becomes the acolyte of the head honcho (Matthew McConaughey, who in only a few short scenes manages to give one of the performances of the year), and in doing so learns the tricks of the trade, which involve indulging in any and all sins of the flesh.But when the market goes belly-up, Belfort (not wanting to go out on his ass like all the other Wall Street schmucks) realizes that he can take advantage of ""penny-stocks"" that no one cares about, pitching them to anyone gullible enough to buy them. Soon, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont, with a merry band of miscreants, including his right-hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Soon, Stratton Oakmont becomes a major, major player in the stock world, luring huge clients in with the hopes of paying out big-time. Except all that Belfort, Azoff and the others care about is their own gain, and the more they make, the more they want. And of course, absolutely none of what Stratton does is legal, so obviously the feds (represented by a dogged Kyle Chandler) seek to rain on Belfort's parade.But before that, the parade roars in full orgiastic force. Scorsese's film is an epic, three hours of every kind of cardinal sin short of murder, with characters both repulsive and entrancing, in a hysterically funny and painfully horrific saga of depravity as only Scorsese can bring. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing never once makes the film feel its length, and Winter's script is jam-packed with colorful moments and almost surreal hedonism. There are so many drug-fueled sequences that anyone who goes in sober will come out with a contact high.Perhaps the most impressive thing about the film is that, at long last, DiCaprio has learned to loosen up. ""Wolf"" allows him to finally sink his teeth in a full-on comic role, and he makes it work impeccably. His energy crackles with every single actor, and he even shows an adeptness at physical comedy (there's a scene involving a 'luded-up Jordan trying to roll himself down stairs that might be the funniest moment of the year). But the rest of the cast is equally up to the task to match him. Jonah Hill is in rarest form here, giving an excellent performance and displaying grand chemistry with DiCaprio. There are guys like Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, even Spike Jonze in a small role that are absolutely wondrous to watch. And I do have to give special shout-outs to Jean Dujardin and Joanna Lumley, both of whom stole the show in playing characters that end up as part of Belfort's scheme to hoard his riches. (If ""Wolf""'s cast has an Achilles heel, it's Margot Robbie as Belfort's bride, who I feel tries so hard to be on Lorraine Bracco's level but comes off as a second-rate Sharon Stone.)Even as the film draws to its close, there's not a single moment where ""Wolf of Wall Street"" wants to relinquish its hold on us. We're in it for the long haul, as Belfort's protégés must have been. And for Scorsese and Schoonmaker, hardly spring chickens, to revive the decadence of the gods in all of its party-hearty glory is something to behold. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" had me flying high, and I'm still waiting to come down from it"
towhomitmayconcern91,"Jan 30, 2014",6/10,"Martin Scorsese has always been the Jewel of New Hollywood, he hasn't burned out like Coppola & Cimino, or softened his image by making giant block busters and family films like Spielberg and Lucas. Even his 2011 film Hugo, while a departure from his normal dark crime films still contained his trademark love of all things cinema. So how did his new film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" ad to his legacy? Well quite frankly we've seen this story before, actually we've seen it twice before in his crime masterpiece Goodfellas, and his chilling biopic (and possible greatest film) Raging Bull. The story of a young hot headed male ( Jordan Belfort, Henry Hill, Jake LaMotta) who starts humble while sinking deeper in their respective world (the corruption of Wall Street, the Italian-American Mafia, or Boxing title fights) is a world Scorsese can tell about growing up in the Machismo rich culture of Italian-American New York. But while each re-telling has seen Scorsese improve his technique and the art of the camera, each successive film has become more sterile. Viewing Raging Bull to this day still is a cinematic art piece that shows the negative consequences of the brutal male psyche, and then in Goodfellas, while Henry Hill follows the same path his character is not one to be sympathized much with, and then finally Jordan Belfort, a character that is as smug and unlikable, but is un-noticed when placed in a film with even more unlikeable characters (looking right at Jonah Hill). None of the characters in this film through the plot even allow you to empathize with them draining the film (with a run time of over 2 hours) of any compassion and only leaving the audience in disgust (especially in the current economic recession, not too many want to see the hubris of Stock Brokers). A Dark comedy, the film offers very few actual laughs, and for all the sex going on the background, none of it is actually sexy, just extravagant and over the top. If it were not for Martin Scorsese being the director I probably wouldn't be rating this film as highly . Not to take from Scorsese as I personally love many of his films (Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino) and with a resume like his he's allowed to make a few good movies opposed to great ones, which is exactly how to describe The Wolf of Wall Street."
fUSEbURNER,"Nov 19, 2021",1/10,"This movie is advocating getting rich on people sorrows, drugs, adultery, and all things in between. You feel dirty after seeing this movie as the director had no attempt to show real end of the day consequences to all the misbehaving of the main characters. Hate it."
Tweekums,"Dec 16, 2018",9/10,"This film tells the story of Jordan Belfort and how he made the fortune that funded his life of excess. After a brief prologue where he explains that he made millions and consumed vast quantities of various drugs we return to his first day on Wall Street; he is on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder but he knows he wants to get to the top... then a market crash puts him out of work. Instead of working at a prestigious Wall Street firm he ends up pushing penny stocks, basically junk, to people who can't really afford the losses they will surely face. It is profitable though and he quickly realises he can make a real fortune selling junk to rich people. He teams up with similarly minded people and creates a 'respectable' firm; soon he is dubbed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and everybody wants to work for him. He gets a new wife, a large yacht and does even more drugs... his main problem is how to secure his money so that the authorities can't get it when they finally catch up with him... and he knows they will one day if he isn't careful.This film is all about excess; it could take a prurient view but instead it revels in it... Jordon Belford and his friends may be drug-taking womanisers were few if any morals but for three hours they are good company. Belford is a charismatic central character; at times he reminded me of Charles Foster Kane, from 'Citizen Kane' at other times he was more like Tony Montana from 'Scarface' without the violence. As fast as he rises it is clear that he will ultimately fall. Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as Belford; I can only suspect that the amorality of the character stopped him getting major awards. The supporting cast is solid too; most notably Margot Robbie who is great as Naomi, Belford's second wife; and Jonah Hill as Donnie, his closest associate. It must be stated that this film isn't for the easily offended; there is prodigious swearing, lots of drug taking, a fair amount of sex and nudity and a small amount of violence... if you aren't offended by that it is a lot of fun. Given that I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting an entertaining romp of a movie."
jcsuperjake,"Apr 13, 2014",8/10,"I first saw this movie about two months after it was released into theaters. I was very skeptical as I heard from some people where they said it was the 'worst piece of crap' they've seen and some saying it was the 'best movie ever'. So I really did not know what to expect except that both sides could agree that there was a lot of sex and drugs. After seeing the movie, I found that it a very good movie overall. Leonardo DiCaprio is yet again very good and is 20 years overdue for an Oscar. He did a very good job portraying Jordan Belfort, the drug abusing stock broker. I did feel a little uncomfortable with he many sexually explicit sex scenes. I did also feel that the movie was very repetitive. For three hours, we watch Leonardo DiCaprio abuse drugs, have sex and look like a jackass. That is about it. But Scorsese finds a way to make it work and to make it entertaining. I was very entertained by this movie."
Skudweld,"Jan 20, 2021",10/10,"This movie is enthralling to say the least. Scorsese improves his rise-and-fall character arc to his fullest ability here. After watching this movie maybe 15 times, it's done nothing but grow on me. Every watch is something new to catch. Every scene worthwhile. Every line adds something to each character. The shots are amazing. While Scorsese is no Kubrick, he does have an amazing eye. The color pallet of each shot is insanely detailed, the tracking shots are perfect, and your focus is never averted from where it's supposed to be. This movie is truly a masterpiece and I really don't care who disagrees. Greed is captured in its truest form here, also with its truest consequences. This is not a movie about being consumed with vices, this is a movie warning you not to be consumed by them. If you're a bad enough person...you might just get rich."

JonaFloppa,"Dec 24, 2020",8/10,"This film is an Exposé of not just corrupt stock brokers, but of human nature in general. A study on Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, and Pride. All of these qualities deep within our human crevices. It is foolish to view these qualities by the seven deadly sins. Instead these are our animalistic flaws within our blood.The quick manic pacing, the cocaine infused script, The raw blood-pumping performances all create an intense exciting story of our own intrinsic nature. The cold, lifeless treatment of women, children, relationships, and friendships are put on blast as to further the power of these money-hungry men. You can smell the piss, sweat, and semen in the air from the attempted attainment of adrenaline.When we view stories like these its easy to determine what is good and what is wrong. We all like to think that we know who we are, and how we would act within a scenario. however sometimes our animalistic nature can take over, and rewrite how we view ourselves.This has to be one of my favorite dark comedy's of all time. I keep finding new things to appreciate in every watch. I know this movie isn't perfect. there are some editing mistakes that ruin the flow of some scenes, certain technical mistakes that could've been fixed relatively easily, however this this is just a really important film with an amazing commentary on human impulses9/10"
jan-panda,"Feb 1, 2014",6/10,"No, absolutely not. Although most of us are.In this one you don't even have a chance... The protagonist is (or in my view an antagonist), although he is a total scumbag with no regard for anyone else rather than himself, portrayed as the good guy who came out unharmed. Who even gives a freaking s**t about him. In reality he's a small fish that got got. The ones that really caused the financial crisis... OK... It doesn't even matter... That'll be saved for another movie... Yeah right...On the other hand I really liked the dialouges and Leonardo's acting. Everything was so absurd and (for us mortals) out of this world. Like who rents or whatever a midget and throws him at a target... It's like watching Jackass... Thing after thing and that makes a story? Not in my book.No explanation for us mortals... What happened? What did they do? How did it came all to this? Oh, right... Thats too much for the regular viewer... They were just extraordinary people that sold junk bonds to poor and afterward rich people and did investment bank stuff.I just can't understand the 8 and over grade...

x-couch-potato-x,"Jul 6, 2023",N/A,"The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese and based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, is a cinematic masterpiece that showcases Scorsese's unparalleled craftsmanship and DiCaprio's incredible talent. It is a wild, audacious, and unapologetic portrayal of greed, excess, and the destructive power of ambition.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Jonah Hill giving a standout performance as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's loyal but eccentric right-hand man. Hill's comedic timing and chemistry with DiCaprio create some of the film's most memorable and hilarious moments. Margot Robbie shines as Belfort's second wife, Naomi Lapaglia, bringing a combination of beauty, wit, and resilience to her role.Brace yourself for a thrilling and provocative ride that will leave you pondering its themes long after the credits roll."
StevenKind97,"Jan 11, 2015",10/10,This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time I really enjoyed this movie and I did not see much wrong with it. This movie was hilarious and there were so many funny scenes throughout the film. This movie tells the story of the stock brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. And it shows all of the illegal acts they participated in. We get to see the journey of Stratton Oakmont with many funny scenes throughout the film. Leonardo dicaprio did a fantastic job portraying stock broker Jordan Belfort and he was very funny throughout the movie. Also Jonah Hill was also very funny playing his role. Matthew mcconaughey was very funny but I wish that he was in more scenes but overall he was really funny and he is my favorite character in the movie. I have never laughed so many times during a movie except for this one this is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I highly recommend this film.
darius-azadeh,"Jan 19, 2014",9/10,"It's a shame that January is usually known as 'bad movie month"" (e.g Movie 43 last year), because this movie is most certainly not. It really is a unique piece of Scorsese's and DiCaprio's track records.I've gotta start of with the humour. This movie is so hilariously funny. Like, my jaw was aching when I came out of the theatre. At least every 4 minutes pretty much everyone in there burst out in humongous laughter. There was a guy next to me literally howling with laughter (maybe he thought the 'Wolf' mentioned in the title was literal?). I think the reason it was like that, though, is because it was so effortless. I've got to say, it was funnier than 50% of the comedies I've seen in the past year. It was so effortless because regular comedy movies just try to hit one emotion: Laughter. So they need to really try, because that's it's purpose. This film hit so many other levels of emotions that everything about it felt so organic and the humour was placed so perfectly. Even the scenes where the story got deep were full of so many emotions and were hard to watch. You could feel it. It was obviously down to the script (there are some parts where you can tell the actors are about to crack up), but also the editing. It had such great comic timing, and was so subtle that it felt completely natural.It's hard to believe that Jonah Hill is that same actor that played the goofy kid in 'Superbad' way back in 2007. It's the best performance of his I think I've seen. It went past the point of seeing Jonah Hill with all his Jonah Hill-isms playing a character that Jonah Hill always plays. For those 3 hours he genuinely was Donny Azoff, and played the role perfectly. He even managed to develop the character through the acting so subtly but so effectively.You can't not mention DiCaprio when talking about performances in this film. Aside from being the brilliant talent he already is, he worked so hard at the role and it defiantly paid off. The parts where he broke the 4th wall while narrating were so seamless, and when his character fell on hard times, he portrayed it with so many different emotions that his character was becoming so complex it was believable. He could have fallen into so many clichés trying to do that, but seemed to have no trouble side-stepping them. I mean, those scenes where he's 'under the influence' show that this guy is prepared to go above and beyond for his roles. Also, even though he was only in it for a short while, McConaughey deserves a shout. I've only seen him in as trailer for 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past' as one of the ads on my copy of 'Quantum of Solace' (I think. Anyway, beside the point), so had no idea what to expect. But boy, he can defiantly act. It's because Scorsese knew what he wanted to get out of his actors.He was definitely the genius behind all of this. His direction is another thing you just can't flaw. Everything little thing added so much to the story or the humour or the characters. His way of making everything so surreally extravagant was an incredible medium into a real life situation. To some it probably seems that the amount of profanity and sex was unnecessary, but I think if there was any less the film wouldn't have been as powerful.A 3 hour thrill ride of hilarious eccentricity and amazing performances, this is a film to be experienced. You'd think that during 180 minutes the pacing would start to drag, but just when you think it does, it'll suck you right back in with underlying comic genius or subtle character development.In a way, it felt nostalgic. And in a word, it was incredible."

I loved it, for one reason....to a much smaller scale, I walked this line as far as the party goes, one roller coaster hell of a ride that was just intoxicating as a lot of people I knew on many levels walked into this dark world of the party seen, and most did not come back and to many still to this day want to keep the party going."
genebpp,"Apr 16, 2014",10/10,"This movie is talking about Jordan Belfort, a broker who became rich. This movie is just awesome, fun and entertaining! This movie is 3 hours long and I felt like this movie was only hour and a half long. It was so damn entertaining! Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill delivers an amazing performance. The plot is nice. It really show how life is. How Jordan Belfort forgot everything and do everything for money, and live by his fortune and fame and he forgot all his life before. This movie represents how money can destroy people very well. Martin Scorsese just directed another masterpiece! One of his best! Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorses is just a great collaboration! Their work is so good. Everything in this movie is just right! It's entertaining, full of energy, fun and dirty!"
