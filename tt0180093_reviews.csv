hwm-05554,"Sep 5, 2020",9/10,"This movie is about how drugs can affect your life. Watching this movie really hurts. If you want to convince someone to stop doing drugs / live more healthy this is the movie to do it. Great acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn) and a realistic / convincing story but man is it painful to watch. This is the kind of movie you are happy to have watched at some point but you don't want to rewatch it because it is a real mood killer.9/10 would recommend if you are looking for a heavy, dramatic movie."
PCC0921,"Oct 11, 2020",9/10,"Requiem for a Dream (2000), is a human character-study on film. Darren Aronofsky's, crazy, drug-induced, rollercoaster-ride, gives that 1980s feel to the viewer, throughout the whole film. It has a fantastic calling to that old-Hollywood-style of filmmaking. The best component to this film is most definitely, the acting. Ellen Burstyn is Sara Goldfarb, a retired couch-potato, who is addicted to a bad self-help TV show, that cons her into believing she can lose weight if she uses certain drugs. These pharmaceuticals eventually destroy her mind and create a horrible addiction for her. Meanwhile, her dead-beat son, Harry (Jared Leto), comes up with the brilliantly dumb idea of creating a haven for himself, his friend Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), by getting into the street-drug business. Unfortunately, he and his friends are now all junkies and things don't go so well as planned.This film is not for the squeamish. It involves many horrible aspects of life. It shows the terrible things human beings are capable of doing, to themselves and the consequences, of such poor decision-making. Requiem for a Dream (2000), does manage to pull at your emotions and makes you feel, very sorry for these people. I won't say anymore, but there is a reason why Ellen Burstyn was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for this film. The directing, camera-work and editing, is fantastic. Aronofsky's direction is quite fitting, for the drug-incited delusions seen in the film. Jennifer Connelly's performance is staggeringly good. She definitely leaves her comfort zone for this film. For myself, Requiem for a Dream (2000), was shocking, brought out many emotions and contained a life-lesson, we should all pay attention to.PMTM Grade: 9.0 (A-) = 9 IMDB."
Picklelover-19091,"Nov 16, 2019",10/10,This movie is the most disgustingly beautiful and horrifying movie.
eric226,"Nov 25, 2002",N/A,"I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines.  A pretty sure sign that those folks weren't able or willing to watch with an open mind.  Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream.  Not because they will like it, or that it will teach them something they did not already know, but that it's a rare piece of work that will challenge and probably change them.  It's a film that has never been made before, with nothing to compare to it - a rarity these days.  I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe.  These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I'd like my family to see this, but can't *recommend* it to them.  I've recommended it to two friends, and they both had the same reaction:  I am glad I watched it, but I doubt I'll be in the frame of mind to watch it again, knowing what you feel.As I sat watching the credits roll, I began crying, but I'm still not sure why.  Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending, partly the beauty (yes) of the film, partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend, not because I wanted to upset her, but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled, we both were silent for a good ten minutes.  I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express, but could find no words.  This is one of the few films that are painful to experience, but I feel compelled to share with people I care about.  Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line, Happiness, River's Edge,and The Deer Hunter.These films all share a quality that's difficult to name.  No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film, a work of art, a piece of music, but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think, not just be entertained, is important now and then.""Favorite"" does not apply to this for me - this isn't about entertainment. One of the most devastating and beautiful experiences I've had watching a film.  One of the top five films I've ever seen."
murkyfish,"Mar 29, 2001",10/10,"I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say, I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork, intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.Jared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definately deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.The other characters themselves hold their own with the two abovementioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem.The cinematography of Matthew Libatique gives total light on the chracterizations of the people in habiting Aronofsky's sick world, from the sliently flickering sick-green flourescents to the exaggerated wide angle shots and the beautifully sad and haunting Coney Island picturesque of the pier which suggests a certain beauty amidst all the sadness and depravity. A Downer Picturesque, as portrayed by the photographs of Robert Frank and the Frank influenced cinematography of Darius Khondji in Seven. In my books, Matthew Libatique has just joined those ranks.Jay Rabinowitz' editing stands out as well, with in-your-face smash title cards(emphasising the downward crash of the character's lives through the seasons), as well as the close-up constructions of the drug taking process. The latter sequences, edited so tightly and seamlessly, make the moment so beautiful but so fleeting, as is the case with drugs. The sequences are almost like a drug, making you crave for more of them, a fix which you get, whenever the characters get their own fix in the film. Lots of people might misinterpret this as glamourising the drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that they're over before you even know it, and then it's back to Harry, Marion, Sarah and Tyrone's sick and depraved search for the next fix, which very accurately portrays the twisted quest of a true and sincere addiction.The film is also superbly scored by Clint Mansell and hauntingly performed by the Kronos Quartet. A series of hauntingly shocking, yet mind-numbingly beautiful pieces which linger in your head long after you've left the cinema.Lastly, the direction of Aronofsky, brilliant, beautiful, empathic. There are not enough words to describe his direction or this film and I think the best way to say it is that I am speechless. Aronofsky has shown me that, jaded by so many films, something can still prompt me to sit up and take notice. To see something that I have never seen before or learn something I don't already know. The ending, is sheer power. A masterpiece of all the elements of what filmmaking is about, mixed together in some sick souffle and thrown into your face, burning hot and scalding. The film leaves a deep impression, in fact, a huge scar. And it is a scar I am proud to wear."
tdao360,"Jul 30, 2001",10/10,"This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two).  This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons."
SeriousMoviesOnly,"Dec 5, 2022",7/10,"It is a very heavy movie that leaves a bad aftertaste. Acting and production are top-notch. Jared Leto resembles a junkie even without this role. Excellent casting.That said, try not to watch it alone or when you are depressed. Certainly not something for a casual evening. One of the few movies that I'd actually recommend reading some reviews before you watch it to get an idea of what to expect.This is not for everyone. Easy to get disgusted and even depressed. So, make sure you know what you sre in for. A must watch for anyone struggling with addictions though.Also, a good reminder to give a call to your Ma! And often."
misanthr0pist,"Feb 26, 2021",10/10,"I watch this movie like twice a year and it gets to me every time. By far my favourite movie ever. Instead of a regular review, here is everything this movie does perfectly.Character Development: this could really be separated into three biopics. The way The film is spliced between three main characters that evolve an enormous deal over 100mins is a work of art within itself.Plot structure and timing: This film is the pinnacle of an effective slow burn. At no point does the runtime seem to drag on, but it is slow enough to make the payoff incredibly valuable. Plot structure and timing are two of the most difficult things in film making, and they were executed perfectly in this one.Sound and score: one of the most effective scores to date. The ups and downs of this film are only expressed further with an extremely effective and catchy score. At no points does it feel obnoxious or out of place, and you'll be thinking of it long after your viewing.Cinematography: The beautiful mix of cinematography that are found throughout this film is perfect. Extreme close ups, split screen scenes and snapshots are all used to express the films ideas in a beautiful way. It does an excellent job to break up the story and to show you the multiple perspectives.An incredible third act: So many great films fall down during the third act. Many-a-film has been ruined by a less than average third sequence, but this one ties up the whole story in a beautiful, non-abrupt way. I couldn't think of a better ending.Performances: Each and every main performance in this film is done with grace and respect. I am always super surprised at Jared Leto's performance, as I've never seen him as an excellent actor. He steals the show here, with a genuine and emotional performance.I really cannot think of anything I don't like or would change about this film. Incredibly engaging, beautiful story and told excellently.Do yourself a favour and watch this masterpiece of filmmaking"
tomduhood,"Jul 26, 2004",N/A,"being someone who had a history with drugs, i found this movie to be slightly more than ground-breaking. i saw this film in the midst of a downward spiral, and it turned me right around! having friends with the same plans, such as sell drugs to buy more drugs..it made me look at my life and theirs and see exactly what the future had in store.now, every time i see this movie since escaping that life, i cry. i cry for my past and those who still live in it. this movie has more to say to people my age than any drug education movie we were afforded in school. honestly, i wonder when the school systems will wisen up to what is really going to get kid's attention; movies that show that pros as well as the cons of drugs, or a movie that shows the complete and utter devastation drugs will bring to your life, and the lives of those around you. honestly, had i seen this film before my sophomore year of high school, i would have never even dreamed of taking more than the prescribed dose of advil.granted, my little summary or comment of this movie does not entail anything informative about the movie itself, i must say, i feel this is the best way i know to express my views."
bshsfo,"Apr 8, 2002",8/10,"I respect and admire this movie, even though (and perhaps because) it is complex, occasionally irritating and often very hard to take.  Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.The subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character's utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew ""scary movies"" forevermore).  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.My only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively.  That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).In sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise).  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I'm not sure whether I'd necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic.  For my part, while I don't expect to watch this film very often in the future, I'm sure glad it'll be on the shelf."
Funk Doctor,"Jul 25, 2001",9/10,"Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise."
Maryam-Jabr,"Aug 20, 2020",10/10,"Every single thing in this movie is made perfectly.
The acting is perfect, they all acted so good i felt it all
The directing is spectacular, they way things were directed and delivered to us is perfect
The sound effects are full of suspense and thriller.
The last 20 minutes i was so stressed through them all and feeling everything with each one of them.
It touched me.
And it you watch a movie and you get the message now that's a good movie.
If you watch a movie and it left you speechless and brain freeze now that is a perfect movie."
mikerudakov,"Aug 1, 2020",9/10,"Fantastic, Oscar Worthy Acting. Beautiful Directing. Must Watch."
powell-yendi,"Mar 18, 2014",9/10,"No one can deny that the message in this movie was powerful. It reveals consequences to drug addiction that are unfamiliar to the general public. One consequence that I overlooked until now is that society would rather punish drug addicts than help them. It was interesting to watch those in positions of power as they abused addicts, took advantage of them, and showed utter indifference towards human life and dignity. I would have rated this movie with a 10/10, but one essential element was missing, backgrounds. Out of the four main characters, the movie only delved into the addiction history of one. It would have been nice to learn about the introduction and descent into drug dependence among the other main characters. They all seemed so beautiful and loving, but viewers would be more sympathetic if traumatic events were used to explain how life can take a turn for the worst."
Deadpoet-4,"Dec 14, 2000",7/10,"(I originally wrote this review for a journalism class. It's my first film review, and i hope to write many more in the future.)I have a theory that the longer it takes me to utter a word at the close of a film, the harder it has hit me. After walking away from Requiem for a Dream, it took me forever to utter even a sigh. I felt as if I had just watched a car accident, and I could remember every gruesome detail.Requiem for a Dream is terrible, haunting film; the kind of film that's dark images that might chase me into nightmares. The film is a nightmare. When I say this I am not speaking from a critical standpoint and this is not a `horror' movie in regular context. However, this piece, about the horrors of drug addiction, is not for the faint of heart. The film was critically a masterpiece, perhaps the best I have seen this year.Requiem was written and directed by Darren Arnofsky, better known for another dark film about life, Pi (1998). Requiem revolves around a young dreamer named Harry Goldfarb, (Jared Leto of My So Called Life, Fight Club) and his widowed mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn of The Yards, Deceiver). The film also features Marlon Wayans (of Scary Movie, In Living Color on television), and Jennifer Connelly (of Dark City, Labyrinth).This isn't the average, run of the mill `Drugs are Bad' stereotypical film, despite the fact it was Arnofsky's mission to create a film that dutifully rendered the theme of the book it was loosely based on, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, A book about the ills of drug addiction. Instead, the extraordinary cinematic technique of Arnofsky makes it hard to look away. He uses sped up sequences, split screen shooting, and various camera angles as a few `brushes' to illustrate the film's basic storyline.Harry Goldfarb (Leto) and his best friend Tyrone (Wayans) have big plans. By getting hold of a fine score of Heroin they are able to cut it themselves and sell it on the streets. With Harry's end of the profit he wants to assist his girlfriend, Marion (Connelly) in making her clothing boutique a dream come true. Somewhere along the line major complications arise, the three frequent the drug more often, and the three are thrown into a wild mix of various trouble with drugs, violence, and the police.Meanwhile Harry's mother, Sarah, (Burstyn) has settled into a painful and lonely routine of cooking and cleaning.  After a phone call from a television game show scout, Sarah wants to diet and look her best. She has even picked out her best dress to wear on television. When her diet seems certain to fail she enlists the help of a doctor. Without so much as a care he prescribes her pills in the form of speed. At first these pills work, yet she slowly becomes addicted, abusing the medication. As time drags on she eventually loses track of herself and reality.Requiem is a shocking look into the world of addiction and denial. The film painstakingly focuses on a mere heartbeat of the lives of Harry, his mother, Tyrone, and Marion. It glorifies and downplays their personal day to day struggles, their fears and hopes, and the eventual destruction of everything around them through their respective addictions.Arnofsky and his cinematographer Matthew Libatique have put the film together is such a manner that time races by when it's characters are on their drugs, yet it seems to drag when they're not. The feeling that the characters believe that life between highs is dull, and they are waiting for the next hit becomes hauntingly evident. In addition the scenes of drug induced highs are bright and busy, while those without are seemingly drab and clouded. One thing that got to me was how dimly lit each of the character's apartments were how little sun came in, the emptiness, and openness of each. In one scene Harry is walking out a pier in the beautiful summer sunshine to Marion, who is waiting patiently in a red dress. I found it interesting since in one of Connelly's latest films, Dark City, she is featured in a similar sequence. It is also interesting to note that Ajay Naidu, Sean Gulette, and Samia Shaoib, who appear in small roles, were also in Arnofsky's film, Pi.One of the most influential techniques in this tale is the music. Clint Mansell (Who worked on Pi as well) employed The Kronos Quartet to perform every song on the soundtrack, such as aptly titled pieces `Ghosts of Things to Come' and `The Beginning of the End.' Each piece is as haunting and nervous as the images on screen, and the music is impossible to ignore as a reminder of the tension and collapse. It is equally as powerful as the film in haunting the viewer long after the final fade."
Udolpho,"Aug 25, 2002",1/10,"The real descent into the quagmire is the last 30 minutes of this film, not the characters within the film. According to this film this is what you can expect from drug abuse: 1. Being force-fed in a public hospital (have these people heard of the IV drip?) and then ECT without any form of anaethesia (every bone in that woman's body would have shattered)- did they take her to a hospital in Eastern Europe?? 2. People with severe septicaemia will be denied hospital treatment and thrown into a cell on suspicion of being a drug addict until they require amputation.  Watch and learn - it's fine to be a junkie as long as you don't get caught. 3. A man will be allowed to vomit into food being prepared in a government run correction facility. If you are bad, you eat vomit. OK? 4. A middle class chick will end up on the other end of a black dildo in order to feed her drug habit. Yawn... I mean, this film says more about what kind of overblown morality Americans are willing to accept in films than anything about drug abuse or its consequences. The anti-drug message descends into hyperbole and farce and I found myself laughing hysterically where I was supposed to be shocked and repulsed. Give me a break. These sanitised stories are just too ridiculous.  As well as this, we are offered the same old, same old routine of white-powder-imagery and colourful-pill-popping. These guys injected something and were bopping around the place, next minute they snort something and they are all on the nod...go figure? And please, the heavy handedness of the junkie losing an arm...spare me, I am not that easily shocked or unaware of symbolism-overkill."
dropthehammer2000,"Nov 12, 2000",N/A,"I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close.  I was totally amazed by her.All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will."
Leofwine_draca,"Feb 27, 2011",10/10,"A tremendous movie, one of those ones that couldn't be improved in any way, shape or form. The script explores the nature of drug addiction on four different characters, showing how it grips and degrades them in different ways.Aronofsky, previously only known for indie hit PI, works wonders as director. He incorporates plenty of frenzied editing and stylish flourishes in a way that complements the story rather than distracts from it. Some of his work, like the chest-mounted cameras, is sublime and gets us into the heads of the characters like never before.Of the cast, Ellen Burstyn towers head and shoulders above the rest in a performance that can only be described as haunting - perhaps one of the most haunting acting turns you'll ever see. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly share equally interesting story lines and are both strong, while what a surprise it is to discover that Marlon Wayans can actually act! The subject matter is grim indeed, with imagery that will stay with you long after watching. Pretty much the definitive look at drug addiction, this is a film that should be shown in every school."
Mnemosyne15,"Mar 27, 2020",8/10,"No matter how happy you are, after you watch this movie, your feelings will be very different and even a little bit vomiting ... Suddenly I thought of a sentence, cherish life and stay away from drugs"
mikayakatnt,"Mar 3, 2020",10/10,"Christ, this movie makes me never want to even get close to drugs.This movie does a better job of scaring people away from drugs than any other PSA or DARE program ever could do.""I'm going to be a star, Harry!""5/5, now I'm going to need to call my mom before I break down."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 29, 2023",9/10,"I vowed I'd never watch this film again, somehow it made me feel bad about myself, I can think of no other film that made genuinely curse some of my addictions in such a way, but....I heard that Requiem for a dream music on a playlist, and I instantly had to watch it. Initially I thought it was merely a film about drug addiction, I'm not as sure now, maybe it's as much a film about addiction in general, Harry's addiction is of course plain to see, but Sara's addiction is more complex, sugar? I didn't consider the possibility before.This film is genuinely uncomfortable to watch, but you cannot take your eyes off it, it's a brilliant film, it should be shown to anyone thinking about having their first fix, it may just make them think twice.Jared Leto is great here, Ellen Burstyn is tremendous, her spiral out of control is incredible, it's so good it hurts.Amazing, but uncomfortable.9/10."
dbdumonteil,"Feb 20, 2005",10/10,"My God! ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.To watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" is like being punched in the face. It's the kind of movie which can't leave indifferent. It is impossible to come out of this horrifying movie unharmed. It was made by a young director Darren Aronofsky whose previous movie ""Pi"" (1998) was very hailed. I must admit that I wasn't fully convinced by this indie movie but here, without a doubt, the director entirely hypnotized me and I thank him for that.The movie was made from a novel written by Hubert Selby Jr. It isn't the first time that a work from this novelist is adapted for the screen. Indeed, in 1989, Uli Edel had shot ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" which developed a nightmarish and apocalyptic vision of a mankind who lived in hell. Here, the movie focuses on 4 main characters. There's Harry Goldfarb. He, his girlfriend Marion Silver and his best mate Tyrone C Love plan to become high-rolling smack dealers. In the meantime, his mother Sarah Goldfarb has got her head in the clouds. She received a call and she learned that she's going to appear on television. At the beginning of the film, the 4 characters' hopes amazingly answers the shiny weather of the summer. But as we usually say: best things have an end. Summer will go away to leave place to fall and winter. Just like the dreams will slowly but surely shatter and the 4 main protagonists will embark on an endless suffering. A vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one and which will reach its climax in winter in the last half-hour of the movie. From this moment, the film presents a flood of incredible pictures; they are so painful so much that they make the view unbearable. However, you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion and fascination.Darren Aronofsky invites us to a climbing in the morbid. ""Requiem for a Dream"" strikes by its visual and sonorous frenzy. Through, accelerated frenetic sequences, hysterical split-screens, parallel images, the director doesn't pull his punches to describe this diving in absolute horror for the 4 characters. However, in his crazy making, there's none form of unwarranted nature. The features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary to answer several things which aren't pleasant to hear like for example, to denounce the omnipresence of the consumer society. These abuses express themselves, here, by the crushing presence of objects, perfectly representative of this society like the television or the refrigerator. The another goals of the film: to make us share the physical and moral sufferings of a drug addict, notably through the deterioration of their visual and sonorous perceptions. But also to show us in a straight-forward and rough way, the dependence of a drug addict on his drug. Aronofsky's message is simple to understand. There's not only the drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like the television or the refrigerator. They can destroy our faculties of reasoning and judgment. In a way ""Requiem for a Dream"" illustrates very well Brad Pitt's key cue in ""Fight Club"" (1999): ""things you own end up owning you..."". On the other hand, if we put the stress on drug, the least we can say is that the moments of shooting, the withdrawal times are showed with a realism and bluntness rarely reached. True, ""Trainspotting"" (1996) had already presented similar scenes but Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to go further in daring.It would be unfair to neglect the terrific cast. Beginning with Ellen Burstyn who in all respects gives a dazzling performance. She renders very well the degeneration of her character. In the beginning, she is a normal old lady but in the end, she looks like a senseless living dead. Why didn't she get her Oscar in 2001 instead of Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000)? Then, concerning Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly well their sensitiveness and fragility are impressive. But the biggest surprise is Marlon Wayans. Who could have thought that he could be at ease in a comic role (Scary Movie) as well as in a dramatic role? These 4 actors make particularly harrowing the very last sequences of the film which show them forever in the depths of despair or madness where pain, humiliation and misery suffer into them. And then, during the final credits, we can hear the sea with a little of relief as if we had just made a nightmare.But what is extraordinary in Aronofsky's work is that he manages to find a little place for humor which acts in an efficient way. In conclusion, this young film-maker has shot a film with a real emotional power. I must confess that I almost shed a tear several times. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie I highly recommend but beware! It's not a movie for everyone and for the spectators who didn't watch it, I advise you not to see it if you are in a sad mood. It demands a strong stomach and I think the people who say they weren't afraid during the projection are liars. Don't forget your handkerchief."
ala-49478,"Nov 12, 2019",10/10,"In my opinion it's in the top 3 movies when it comes to addiction and top 20 movies in general.
The music score adds to the dark, psychedelic filming. It's the same repeated music but done so perfect it makes you anxious and depressed... just what this movie is trying to do. It does it so well. If you are an addict or know one, it may trigger some unwanted feelings.
Just be prepared to feel like crap after the movie ends."
redwards13,"Oct 24, 2002",1/10,"Remember the anti-drug commercial where a girl points to an egg, says, ""this is your brain,"" and then screams, ""this is your brain on drugs!"" as she smashes the egg with a skillet and proceeds to demolish the entire kitchen, screaming, ""and this is what drugs do to your family, this is what they do to your future..."" and so on?If you can imagine that commercial going on for two hours, done with great visual style and editing, with acting that ranges from excellent (Ellen Burstyn) to terrible, you can skip this movie. While Requiem for a Dream sells itself as an important movie about important subject matter, it does nothing to explain why REAL PEOPLE do drugs. Its characters are not people. They suffer without reflection on their own states, while the filmmaker attempts to bombard you with visual symbols explaining what they want and feel. While one could interpret the device used to explain why the Burstyn character continues her downward spiral, the game show, as a meaningful symbol for individuals' desires for acceptance and recognition, I don't think it is one. It is a gimmick that condescends to the character by making her desire for acceptance pathetic and silly. The movie tells you what to think about her inner motivations by staging them in a highly subjective way.This way of revealing character is consistent throughout the movie. Characters are without interior lives, or at least their interior lives are not revealed. At the same time, the movie uses symbols (the game show, the television, etc...) to suggest the reasons for their desires. While real people do drugs for complex reasons which are hard to unravel, these characters are living in a movie-world symbolism which suggests familiar, ""important"" reasons for their behavior that tie into the most materialistic, shallow aspects of our society. And of course the shallow, cheap aspects of our culture are harmful to us all, and we recognize them in the movie. So despite their lack of depth, is not hard for us to relate to these characters, and maybe even feel sorry for them, since they exist only as empty vessels into which we may pour our own self-pity."
jewinda,"Jun 18, 2001",N/A,"Often hype about films lead to disappointment and after waiting 14 months after release for my local cinema to show this film, I was done thinking about it. Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I've never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.This movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the 'slasher flick', this stuff is REAL.In a country amid a 'war against drugs' this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government ""task-force"" or classroom lecture."
bkoganbing,"May 5, 2010",8/10,"Requiem For A Dream is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen in my life. These poor people from two generations are a lot like Anthony Quinn in Requiem For A Heavyweight. As a boxer Quinn in that film saw his career at an end and faced a very unpromising future. These people have no future at all.I certainly recognized the Coney Island/Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn, an area of projects and an amusement area that has seen better days. Like Atlantic City, some in Coney Island eventually see casino gambling as the gimmick for a rebirth. If you see Requiem For A Dream, imagine it in that kind of Las Vegas type setting.At one time Brighton Beach was a template for a working class Jewish paradise of sort with families housed in apartments that partially built with the backing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Back when I was doing senior citizens crime claims at New York State Crime Victims Board, I can't tell you the number of claims from men and women who listed a small ILGWU pension as part of their income from that area. Such a woman is Ellyn Burstyn playing Sara Goldfarb.Things haven't gone right for her. As the neighborhood decayed, so did her life and family. Her one son Jared Leto, a promising kid at one time is now a hopeless addict with an addict girlfriend in Jennifer Connelly and an addict best friend in Marlon Wayans.I've known a few junkies in my time also. After a while they only have one thing on their mind, their particular addiction of choice and how to service it. Even if they want to rise in the dope trade business, they haven't got a head for business any longer.Which in a nutshell is the position of Leto and Wayans with Connelly in support figuring her own habit can be taken care of by following their lead. Of course its disaster all around.As for Ellyn Burstyn she gained Requiem For A Dream's only Academy Award recognition with a nomination for Best Actress. She's not just clueless about her son, she's caught up in her own chemical dependency. She dreams of her 10 minutes of fame on some daytime quiz show and gets herself nicely hooked on diet pills. Unlike her son, she does have some memories of better days and talks about them with her peers on the benches outside the apartments.I recognized a lot of the Brighton Beach/Coney Island area of Brooklyn where this was all shot on location. Requiem For A Dream is a sad film about sad people, definitely one to bring you down from any kind of high you might be on."
vithiet,"Dec 29, 2018",9/10,"Great writing, directing and acting performances from all but especially Jennifer Connelly. I have however never felt that awfully uncomfortable after watching a movie and no matter how fantastic it is, I never want to watch it again. I do very highly recommend watching it at least once though."
TheLittleSongbird,"Oct 13, 2011",9/10,"I like Darren Aronofsky, and Requiem for a Dream is one of his better and I think his most powerful film. I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
Quinoa1984,"Dec 22, 2001",10/10,"Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance.In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination. Like it or not though, this film begs for multiple viewings- and some extra years of looking at other films, which was the case with me. There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end, and nothing will ever be the same for anyone, especially as they're alive and lacking redemption (though if I had to place who's story is most compelling, and performance-wise as well, it would be Burstyn's)."
SnoopyStyle,"Jun 5, 2014",8/10,"Four lives are disintegrating. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) wants to start selling drugs on their own. She is obsessed with TV infomercial personality Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). She gets a call about her winning a TV contest and she's so excited that she goes on a crash diet. Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend and she's pulled into his scheme.It's director Darren Aronofsky's second full length feature, and it shows that he has an unique vision. These are compelling characters in unforgettable stories. Ellen Burstyn is completely immersed into her role. Their slow descent is hard to take and hard to take my eyes off of. The use of quick cuts, fast forwards, and close ups all accentuate the disturbing nature of drugs. The use of SnorriCam which attached to the actors' bodies is probably the most memorable. It's all very disturbing."
thisisnothere-1,"Jun 11, 2008",6/10,"This film is great in it's artistry, cinematography...but WAY overrated. Very cliché plot. The acting is good though, the best I've personally seen from Wayans. But aside from simply being very disturbing, which was an obvious desire of the director, it's just kinda boring. Lots of drug usage scenes. Get's pretty old. Im sure that was a desired effect so they could show how deeply they were getting into their usage, but after awhile its just like ""ok...here we go again. Borrrring."" Feels stale after like...the 3rd, 4th, 5th time. And it occurs a LOT more than that. A fairly typical ending. May be very disorienting to watch for some. Good film but definitely overrated."
ThomasJ17,"Oct 25, 2018",10/10,"After hearing about how depressing and surreal this film is, years and years later I finally watch it. I've never been put into the state of shock I was in after watching this movie; The reality of addiction and self-destruction that is put into this film has left a distressing impact on me that no other film has ever done before. This is one of those movies that you would recommend to someone in a heartbeat but also a movie that you would advise someone to stay away from because of the emotional impact it leaves on you after; It's also a movie that you would have to watch at least once as many people have said.
Absolute masterpiece, all I can say."
Jared_Andrews,"Jul 30, 2020",7/10,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is a little too depressing to be a movie I would say that I like a lot. I don't mean that as any sort of disrespect, because it absolutely is a well made movie.It is apparent that writer and director Darren Aronofsky successfully put together the movie he intended to make. Every character development point along their arc, every scene and even every frame fulfills its purpose. Drugs enter the lives of each character - an aimless young man, his girlfriend, his friend, and his widowed mother. They all experience the euphoric highs when using drugs, and they experience the swift and devastating lows. Desperation flows through each character.Aronofsky creatively makes use of disorienting camera angles to illustrate the unhinged frame of mind that these people deal with while high. Closeups are meant to make viewers uncomfortable, as we are forced to closely encounter a manic drug addict. Aronofsky also uses intentionally repetitive drug use sequences to make clear how often they are using and how completely consumed their lives are by the drugs. Another creative touch I'll mention is his use of split screen of two characters who are lying right beside each other. At first it seems like a superfluous choice, but after consideration I realized that it is meant to show how alone these characters are, even when they are together.What a depressing thought.Fair warning to anyone who hasn't seen this yet: the movie is a bummer. Brace yourself."
user-881-339468,"Feb 21, 2014",10/10,"It seems that, all of a sudden, after the film, everything goes blank. You can do nothing but feel shocked, afraid and get to understand how hard the life would be.With a big 'X' presenting on the scene, the dream, one they pursued so hard, proves to be impossible. The tragedy goes without saying. It's not surprising, mostly for the wrong way they insist. Reasonable as it is, it appears to be so unacceptable, due to our lack of thinking ow miserable living could be.It uses many details in particular ways. Lights flashing on and off, two views showing the same time,etc. There's no need to use frightening words or violent. Gradually, the atmosphere where the fear lies makes it a wonderful thriller."
ccthemovieman-1,"Mar 7, 2006",8/10,"After watching this for first time, I thought to myself, ""Wow, with some appropriate editing, this ought to be required viewing for high school students as it's probably one of the best ""anti-drug"" presentations one could ever see.Young filmmaker Darren Aronofsky takes a depressing subject and makes it fun to watch, if that's possible. However, I'm speaking in general terms because - warning - a couple of scenes are anything but fun to view. Aronofsky uses stop- action/fast forward techniques, sound effects, hallucination scenes, etc. all to make this a good movie for the senses.Ellen Burstyn is outstanding in this film and many people who viewed this thought she should have won an Academy Award for her performance. Boy, if she doesn't scare you away from taking diet pills, nobody can. She's the only one in this film that is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly can be one easily ogled by us guys but she plays so many sleazy, unlikeble roles, it's tough to warm up to her.Jared Leto, meanwhile, does his best to show us the horrors of what could happen when you hooked on junk which involves needles. In the last 30 minutes there are a few horrifying parts as Leto's infected arm gets worse and worse. People who have seen this film know what I'm talking about, It is grim, very grim but maybe that's what all of us need to see once in awhile.To watch Bursteyn and Leto slowly disintegrate is unforgettable and for Aronofsky to make this watchable was quite a feat. But for the grace of God, as it is said, one of these characters could be us."
jaybee511,"Jul 7, 2001",8/10,The last fifteen minutes of this film was some of the most horrifying yet gripping scenes I have ever seen.  As the credits rolled I sat there motionless with my mouth agape.  Everybody must see this movie.  I wanted to look away so bad but yet I couldn't stop watching.  Mesmerizing.
mkdropper,"Feb 1, 2025",7/10,"Lux Aeterna is my introduction to classical music. It is one of the first 10 pieces of music I listened to on my S3353 phone. I don't like this piece just like that. I still listen to it. It is one of the most popular pieces in the world anyway. Even though it dates back to my childhood, I have never sat down and watched the movie. Whenever I imagined something about this music, it was terrifying. Especially when I watched the Illuminati cards on YouTube and they played this music in the background, I would get so scared that I can't explain it. For that reason, I always thought the movie was about the Illuminati, but it was true. It was an adaptation of a book. For that reason, it would be a bit incomplete to write this review before reading the book, but I still want to write it, maybe I will come back here after reading the book in the future.The story of the Requiem for a Dream movie seemed a bit normal to me. In other words, there weren't many moments when I was surprised, scared or sad while watching it. Of course, I don't want to say it's a cliché, but I mean, a person expects a point where they will be surprised. The film tells the story of a woman who wants to appear on a TV show and develops an eating disorder while trying to fit into the clothes she wants, and her son, who loses his mind with the local drug dealing business and naturally becomes a drug addict, and the film progresses exactly as you can imagine. At first, everything is bad, then there is hope, then a peak and a decline. In other words, I didn't expect anything different. The story seemed quite banal and standard to me. I looked around a bit, and they called the man who diagnosed the woman and prescribed medication a criticism of the health system, but I think it would have been a criticism on the same level if it had written ""the health system is very bad"" on the screen instead of this scene. It is of poor quality. But of course, the highlight of the film is not its story. It is more the way it presents this story to you. So now let's talk about the cinematography a little.The film is shown to us in parts. It has divided these into seasons. Each season is divided into good beginning, a peak, a fall and a devline. The flow of the film for the characters is like this. At first, they start calmly. Then things peak. Then the devline begins and we watch their final collapse. As a scene, sometimes the idea of seperating characters side by side was nice but it seemed boring to me. Maybe it is revolutionary for the year 2000 but I don't think it is a bad stage play. The only think I found beautiful about the movie is its ending. At the end, we see everything as its very bottom with very fast scene transitions. We see that everything is completely over but as I sait, I can't fully emphasize it because there is nothing surprising in this. In other words, I can't get the main idea of the movie, even if there is, I don't accept something that simple. I also listened to the soundtrack and it wasn't a pleasant surprise for me that everything except Lux Aeterna was just a repetition of 5-6 songs.The acting is the best part of the movie, believe me, I never like acting. Our old lady played wonderfully. I really liked the tremors in her voice. She played as if she really lived her head movements, eyes, conversations, I congratulate her but I can't say much about the rest of the cast, it's normal.I probably look a little disappointed. It happened that way, while I was expecting something more legendary, I encountered a more standard movie but of course it is not bad and it is definitely not a waste of time. I still say try it but unfortunately its level is low as a plot and story. It is only watched for its music and last scene."
Yldthng,"Oct 22, 2000",7/10,"I was skeptical of seeing this movie because I have to admit Pi was not exactly my favorite movie.  But after seeing Requiem, I left the theater stunned.  This was an incredible movie, with beautiful imagery and the entire cast was amazing.  Ellen Burstyn definitely deserves an Oscar for her role as a lonely and unknowing speed addict, and who knew that Marlon Wayans could act??  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly were great as usual. The last few minutes of the movie left me horrified, but in a surprisingly good way.  You MUST see this movie."
halfcolombian,"Sep 9, 2002",1/10,"I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying ""hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too."" Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch ""panic in needle park"" or the german movie ""christiane f"" both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40% voted a 10 for this."

sejaco21,"Mar 25, 2003",10/10,"After I watched requiem for a dream I immediatley thought it was the most powerful movie i have ever seen.  Before viewing it I didn't think it could get much worse then American history X, but Requiem takes it to a whole other level.  Not only was it the most moving movie ever, but also one of the best.  After the credits rolled i sat on my couch for an hour contemplating the movie.  the next day i went to amazon and ordered the unrated version.  Since then i haven't gone a day without thinking about it. I would reccomend this to everyone not because it's a happy movie, but because you have to see it.  I don't know about showing it in school, it's a lot to handle especially unrated, but what a great message it has.  I don't know who wouldn't think twice before injecting heroin in there arm after watching this.  A great story with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Not only was the acting great, but the directing stood out especially when they take the drugs.  The music at the end also is very moving and powerful. I would give this movie a ten out of ten and i reccomend it for everyone, you should watch it with an open mind and see it for what it was worth."

ronakkotian,"Jun 29, 2020",10/10,"Darren Aronofsky is one of the craziest filmmakers working today. His latest film, mother!, was crazy but Requiem for a Dream was on another level.Requiem for a Dream follows four characters and the effect their drug addiction has on their physical and mental state.When the credits started rolling, I was in a state of shock and horror. I don't think a movie has left me feeling so disturbed. I breathed a sigh of relief as this film gives an experience that's completely anxiety inducing. This is most certainly a film NOT for the faint-hearted.The way Aronofsky handles this film is perfection. We start with each character at the best point of their life and then see their addiction slowly spiral out of control over the course of the runtime makes the film engaging from start to finish and shows Aronofsky as a master of build up. The camerawork and editing is very stylish and fast paced, not allowing you to take a breather at any given moment. The quick edits and close-ups puts the audience into the state of mind of each character creating a more terrifying and immersive experience. The soundtrack is also great. It's filled with music that's ominous which fits the tone perfectly.What makes the film even more horrifying are the fantastic actors on-screen. Jennifer Connelly delivers a solid performance for a role that requires a lot from her and Jared Leto proves to me he's a capable actor with a powerhouse performance here. Marlon Wayans really surprised me as I'm used to seeing him in comedies and I wish he would take on more serious roles as this film shows his talent. However, the winning performance here was done by the excellent Ellen Burstyn. Especially for her age, her role was very challenging and demanding and she gave the performance of a lifetime here. It's sad she didn't win an Oscar for it.If there's ever a film that deters you from taking drugs, it's Requiem for a Dream. It's definitely a challenging watch but if you're up for it, I would highly recommend it."

imdbmykl,"Nov 20, 2003",7/10,"I must admit that I was somewhat surprised to see that this film is rated at #46 (at time of writing) in the IMDB Top 250. While it was a good film, I don't think that it was powerful enough to rate so highly.Perhaps it's that there are relatively few drug-culture films around and that the viewer is not accustomed to the shock that the inevitable downward spiral finishes at. Or maybe it just got a much wider audience than many of those that came before it.In any case, the film is a good watch, but the highlight by far is the story of the mother and her obsession with dieting. I found myself drawn into her story far more than that of the other three characters.Overall, I'd give this 7/10. If you liked this, check out Drugstore Cowboy - I think they did it better..."

What I mean by that is that they throw so many awful things in your face time over and over again and it just gets worse and worse and worse. Your brain gets kind of ""uhm...oh...wow"". It didn't make me think. It made my brain numb.If you really look deep in to it though, you'll not find much other than the message that ""Drugs are bad, just look how awful these people's lives has turned out!"". There's not much more to it. The characters don't really have any deep struggles (other than drugs of course), at least not that we see. They are pretty one dimensional.In the end, I didn't really feel sympathy for them per se, because they didn't really tell me anything other than ""wow...oh...this is just awful"" and they where just so incredibly pathetic, the whole lot.On one hand, I hate this movie for making my brain numb and removing my thinking, and by that ignoring that this movie ISN'T that deep. It'll make you it is, but really isn't.Once again, it's the shock value. This is really thanks to the whole feeling of the movie and the way it's filmed and the lovely soundtrack it has! It's really powerful, but there is not much behind it.The acting is good.I give this movie a 5 out of 10, just because it's so impressive how the movie affected me."
proprab,"Mar 20, 2017",10/10,"Must see movies for those who are drugs addicted, because they don't feel their minds about addiction and ignores the worst outcomes of their addiction.This movies show you that addiction can take you and your body to do any worstthings to fulfill your addiction desires, no matter how your body andsoul suffer in pain and destruction you are still can't get away fromdrugs stuffs once you have taken and enjoyed that stuffs."

AndrewPap,"Sep 25, 2014",10/10,"Νοτ a single thing about happiness in this gold masterpiece named Requiem For A Dream.With A very strong,emotional and inexorable directing from a genius and great director as Darren Aronofsky.There's so much pain,sadness and strong emotions with a very realistic way about the world we all leave in and a very hard social message about drugs and not only drugs but all the species of addictions such as T.V. and other stuff.The Performances are all great with top of all Ellen Burstin with her best performance of her life.She is shocking and heartbreaking.To sum up this movie is great a true masterpiece and in my opinion this movie must be seen by every person and especially teenagers about its social message.GREAT"
ritilatomi,"Aug 20, 2014",10/10,"Excellent movie and it gets better every time I see it again. Basically it is a desperate description of drug use in the modern American big city. On the other hand, the movie paints a meticulous depiction of a couple of people striving for happiness, satisfaction and a better, more fulfilling life. Especially Jared Letos work is stunning although other main characters perform excellently as well. One might find the movie very depressing and sad but that might be the aim of Aronofsky the director to get that kind of mood in his masterwork. World is full of happy and cheery movies so there is always a room for a bit depressing ones, too?"
AbuelaYaya,"Oct 7, 2022",8/10,"The feelings that Requiem for a Dream leaves you with makes it hit way different from other sad movies. Sad endings sometimes make the viewer cry, but the viewer can always assume that either the story is over or that there's still the possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. With this movie those are not options. The viewer knows that the hole in which the characters got themselves in just keeps getting infinitely bigger, and that the possibility of getting out of that hole became inexistent a long time ago. What makes this feeling so peculiar is that this movie is real. Addiction is real and Aronofsky did an incredible job portraying how it snatches away the dignity of human beings. Watching someone become a slave of their own mind and knowing that hoping is futile is why this film breaks the viewer's heart in such a peculiar way."
cseabhi,"Sep 13, 2020",7/10,"It is easy to say this movie isn't for everyone. If you love the happy endings and light hearted movie, stay away from this. Having said that, 'Requiem for a Dream' is filmmaking at its best.Literally it has blown me over the first time I watched this movie. Had a great impact on me and this is not an easy watch. It can drain you emotionally"
Abdulxoxo,"Jan 31, 2021",7/10,"Requiem for a dream follows three different story lines that are connected to each other with four different characters; Harry, his mother Sara, his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone. The movie vividly shows the sensation of what drugs actually do to your body and your life in generally. The four characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, disgusting addictions. The film touches on themes like racism, family conflicts, trust issues, extreme self confidence, neglecting the surroundings and more. The film, however, fails at creating unique and original characters with even the slightest amount of depth. I get that the bleak lighting and dark subject matter is meant to amplify the effect of the film's portrayal of drug addiction, but it left me feeling detached most of the time. It's a series of events within these characters lives that we're watching unfold, but the characters don't have any real goals they're working towards. Any obstacles they face are induced by themselves due to their poor decision making which I guess is the point. At the end of day, this movie tells us nothing we don't already know. However the technical elements were really something else; the cinematography is slick but with odd camera shots/angles; the editing is also great albeit it's gets too comfortable with the use fancy effects; the MVP of the film for me is the music, It is very charmingly and hauntingly scored, having a real presence while also allowing the atmosphere to speak, which it wouldn't have done as effectively if the scoring was louder, brasher and more constant. Requiem for a Dream definitely benefitted from having a more melancholic, lilting and sometimes sparse approach to the music. The main theme is very memorable too."
FrankDamage,"Apr 20, 2005",3/10,"Talk about a let down. I had heard nothing but raves about this one in the genre of ""drug films"", but when I finally saw it I realized that the raves were from raving lunatics. You might want to head to a fallout shelter if you're planning to watch this bomb. It only shows that a populace raised on the current standard of unrealistic ""reality t.v."", will buy anything.Right off the top, the acting is reminiscent of an over-dramatized silent movie. Not easy to do when you have experienced actors like Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons (whose performances while very good, become almost comical as a result of the script and the director's efforts). While Ellen Bursten does a great job of portraying Harry's rapidly deteriorating and lonely mother, for a film that tries to take itself and it's subject matter so seriously, the comedic aspect of her scenes seem very out of place.The film's hysteria and sensationalism reach ridiculous heights. It's overloaded, absurd and unconvincing. Camera angles that would serve better in a music video make up most of the ""substance"" of this very gimmicky film. And don't get me started on some of the worst New York accents I've heard since I visited Kentucky.If there's one positive thing I can say about this movie it's that it is very likely to dissuade the type of impressionable NAIVE young minds that could fall victim to the very real perils of serious drug use (most of which is grossly exaggerated in this farcical film). However those same impressionable minds are undoubtedly the ones that will believe this film paints a ""stark and real"" picture of what happens to everyone who uses drugs, without exception.Overall, if you have never had a drug problem, known anyone in your entire life who has had one, ever used drugs, or heard anyone talk realistically about drugs, then maybe this is the movie for you. An MTV version of the ""real world"" from a junkie's perspective. It's not even amusing as the joke it ends up being. In the genre of drug movies this one should be filed under ""oregano""."
indimurgatroyd,"Sep 18, 2022",8/10,"I just finished watching this and I've never felt so empty. I cried a lot ,not because of the sadness of the situations all four characters are in though
(as much as they are all very sad) I was crying because of how horrible and disturbing the whole ordeal was especially those last 20 minutes. Seeing the consequences of all the characters addictions rapidly thrown at your face within such a short amount of time was so overwhelming and intense to the point I had to pause the movie to just process how I was meant to be feeling. For this reason I hate this movie. Not one bit of it was enjoyable. It was SO amazing though. Technically speaking I think the movie does a great job of getting its point across and telling the character arcs. It's acted very well especially by Ellen burstyn and I can really appreciate the camera work and stylisation of the movie as a whole with the very quick and intense shots creating a really fitting atmosphere for the horrors of addiction the movie portrays.this film is really really great. But I hated watching it and I will probably never do it again lol."
dbrown-13,"Mar 20, 2007",10/10,"Some of the mainstream reviews I had read about this movie prior to watching it didn't describe this movie favourably. Many of the criticisms were that this was just another 'drug movie', just another tale of hopelessness and despair. Some said that the story of addiction told here was 'unrealistic', some even suggested that this movie and it's approach were glorifying drug use.After watching this I wondered if these reviewers had just watched the same film I had?? This has to be the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalising, or condoning drug use in any way.It tells of the plight of 4 individuals, their respective descent into drug dependency, the effects this has on their relationships with each other, and the eventual lengths they will go to feed their addiction. On the contrary to the reviews I had read earlier, it occurs to me the depiction here is perhaps a little too 'realistic' for recreational viewing. Though this movie is certainly not 'easy going' it is a rewarding experience in the end.The film benefits from first rate performances (particularly Ellen Burstyn - an acting tour de force), superb cinematography and solid directing. The jump cuts and fast editing work really well here too, setting a suitable tone for the movie, conveying the character's disjointed and erratic perceptions of reality to the viewer effectively. Lastly the haunting musical score composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is as striking as it is original, complementing the mood of the movie perfectly.There is always a danger when making a movie dealing with issues such as these that the end result may appear contrived or over-sentimental, that the overall message become muddled; conflicting. This isn't the case with 'Reqiuem for a Dream', thanks to faultless execution in all aspects this movie is nothing short of excellent - 10/10."
jon-larsen,"Jan 7, 2010",10/10,"Ellen Burstyn blew me away in this film! This is her best role so far!This movie is about four drug addicts. They all have dreams, but as dependence on drugs is increasing, their dreams are turning into nightmares.The acting is phenomenal. The story and how Aronofsky tells the story is just fantastic! The music is extraordinary. The cinematography is amazing! The directing is great. I also love how Aronofsky expresses his feelings without words and body language but with camera!I've almost seen a thousand of movies and no movie has ever affected me like this one!Even though this movie is amazing, I warn you: This movie will haunt you for several days!Mr.Aronofsky has done a great job, if you feel sick,depressed or got the feeling that you're not going to touch drugs, after you've seen this movie! The movie is very brutal,tragic and honest. I hope you stay off drugs after you've seen this!This is a cinematic masterpiece and a fantastic work of art!10/10"
johnny-407,"Feb 3, 2007",10/10,"I first saw this movie three weeks out of a four month rehab for cocaine and heroine addiction. I had thrown away a professional career, personal relationships and all else for drugs.On first viewing, I considered Requiem lightweight and overstated. Having participated in the activities depicted- and more- the movie seemed like yet another ""Drugs Are Bad For You"" movie.I have since watched it several times and- seven years out of the drug life- its impact is very powerful. While no film will accurately portray the true events and effects of an overwhelming addiction, Requiem does convey the impact that such an addiction has on others.This is on my Top Ten list and contains a worthwhile statement effectively delivered."
redjackco,"May 5, 2005",7/10,"A film-making tour de force of style, ""Requiem"" is ultimately exploitation masquerading as art. Apart from the glitz and glamor of the cinematography and editing, where is the character development? Where are the twists and turns in the story? Where are the delightful surprises that great films always give us?Were it other than a straight linear, chronologically ordered record of four characters' steady descent into hell, it might be more than a simple diary of the times.Students wanted me to show this in my film class this past semester. Sometimes I will show films I have not previous viewed. This time I chose not toI'm glad I made the right decision."
venuswicked,"May 27, 2001",N/A,"Do not see this movie if you thought Julia Roberts really deserved that Oscar.  Do not see this movie if you really dig romantic comedies.  Do not see this movie if you don't enjoy thinking....or being pushed to the edge and left for dead.  Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted, moved, sickened, and utterly amazed.This movie did for smack what even ""Trainspotting"" failed to do.  Although ""Trainspotting"" had a definite anti-smack message, and some people died, and it was pretty disturbing it pales in comparison to this movie. ""Trainspotting"" had a few really disturbing scenes, but even they were ""prettier"" than half of what goes on in ""Requiem For A Dream"".  Renton crawls down a toilet; Harry shoots up into a festering wound and has his arm amputated.  And while no one dies physically in ""Requiem"" (at least no major characters), in the end everyone is left with a large part of their soul missing....not to mention their mind.  There are other comparisons and contrasts to be made, but the point is: if you can still think drugs are ""cool""  or anything other than ""mind bending-ly terrifying"" after watching this movie you are scary.Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Trainspotting"" and I know that it wasn't meant to be what ""Requiem"" was.  But the similarities were too obvious for me to ignore.  ""Requiem"" isn't meant to tell a story as much as ""Trainspotting"" was.  ""Requiem"" is meant to put the fear of God into you, and it succeeds. And Ellen Burstyn is INCREDIBLE!Yes, the movie has flaws.  But I still haven't seen the ""perfect"" movie yet, so that can hardly be held against it's brilliance.  Darren Aronofvsky is going places.  ""Pi"" was really good, ""Requiem"" is great, I can't wait to see what's coming next...So don't watch this movie if it sounds too hard to watch (and it is very hard to watch) and don't watch it if you don't want to be depressed (in a beautiful way).  But if you do decide to watch it, don't do it alone.I don't usually give stars, but just to show how much this movie moved me: 9 out of 10.  And it only got 9 because I'm still sane."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 9, 2006",9/10,"I didn't know what ""Requiem for a Dream"" was about when I rented it, and I was stunned. This ultra-gritty look at several people's lives degenerating due to drug usage is like nothing that you've ever seen. It's more polished than ""Pi"", but no less eye-popping. As mentally decaying retiree Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn makes your blood freeze the same way that she did in ""The Exorcist"". Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also bring to their roles an intensity rarely seen on screen. And let me tell you, I never could have predicted what would happen during those last few minutes! In conclusion, see this movie if you dare. I should warn you that it may knock your breath out. You have been warned. Also starring Christopher McDonald and Louise Lasser."
bnally62191,"Mar 18, 2007",10/10,"This film makes you FEEL the characters. You aren't even introduced to the characters and you feel their pain, it's very depressing. Darren Aronofsky did a excellent, and I mean EXCELLENT, job with the camera angles, the effect, the music was great, everything. This film was very hard to watch in some scenes, perhaps because the acting was great, Ellen Burstyn should have won the Oscar in my opinion. I stumbled upon it at FYE, watched it, and never wanted to see it again in my life. I wanted the DVD in the trash because it was that powerful and moving. I turned the film onto friends and family and I hear the same reaction from everyone, ""Man that was sad"" or ""It was too depressing."" I highly recommend this MUST SEE film"
mrtimlarabee,"Jul 10, 2007",10/10,"When I go to the museum, I am often awed at these still lifes from dutch painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. There were those beautiful still lifes, showing a vase of flowers down to the slightest detail. But oh, it would be the one that captured some sort of devastation or ugliness that would capture my attention. The strange thing was as devastating and grotesque one would be all the more beautiful and engrossing.What is beautiful about such a painting is the thing that makes Requiem for a Dream such a beautiful film. A true artist captures what he or she sees, lives, or feels. If the artist fails to do this, then they create a sugar coated work. It is satisfying for the moment, but ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression. Too often, ""artists"" compromise their work for the sake of commercial success, painting ""beautiful"" pictures that are often too common in the field. Requiem for a Dream defies this by painting a grotesque, gripping portrait of addiction. Not once does Darren Aronsky flinch in creating this pictures. It is at time ugly, grotesque, sick, and devastating. But like a classic still life, you can't turn away as you stare at every stark detail.What I love about this film is that you know your own in for a downhill ride when you begin the film. Jared Leto's character is taking his mother's TV to be sold to get drugs. This moment just scratches the surface of the downward spiral we are about to witness. Aronsky's characters suffer and never turn back. And nothing more need be said of Ellyn Burstyn's fantastic performance as she deals with delusion, drug addiction, and an addiction of a different sort, with the television.The film has a big finish which is one of the most classic scenes in American film. Although I imagine most pointed towards this review have seen it, I dare not spoil it. It's the final detail in the still life. The one that makes you stare and stare - not so much at its beauty, but its sheer unrelenting truth."
JamalHassan23,"Oct 28, 2020",10/10,"As I was warned before, I warn you that this film will hit you so hard you may never want to watch it again.No movie has ever scared me as much as Requiem for a dream. I do not know when I will ever watch it again, but even with the one watch it has changed my views on a lot of things unlike any other film. This film should be shown to college students as a warning for the types of addictions we allow to take over our lives. Once you have been able to finish this movie you should watch Darren Aronofsky's previous film, Pi (1998)."
michaelholland-81075,"Nov 8, 2019",8/10,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about addiction and the capacity it has to destroy lives. The film explores this idea through the following of four different characters, addiction all gripping them and acting out its malice in distinct ways. Aronofsky produces a highly emotional snapshot into the lives of these characters, and masterful camera work and creative shots display it in full. Aronofsky's use of timelapse, close-ups, and various other imaginative tricks allow the viewer to enter the perception of a drug-fueled mind; which in turn produces greater empathy for the characters as they embark on their downfall. The world Aronofsky creates is deprived and suffocating, prompting the viewer to understand or perhaps reconcile the characters' desire to escape. The acting by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are true and imbued with vehemence. ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is a difficult movie to watch, but is worth viewing on the basis of the quality of the storytelling."
FilmOtaku,"Apr 7, 2003",7/10,"I have to admit, I have wanted to watch RFAD for a couple of years now. However, I let other people's opinions keep me from seeing it, which is something I don't normally tend to do.  Everyone who has recommended it to me has said, ""You will LOVE this movie, it is so dark and heavy.  It's REALLY dark and REALLY heavy.""  So for a couple of years, I've had it on the back burner but hadn't actually picked it up. RFAD seems to have become a staple on some of the ""pay"" movie channels on cable, and on Friday night it was a choice of one of my DVDs, Swingers on HBO or RFAD.  I chose RFAD and was cautiously delighted.I will preface this review by stating that I have not yet seen Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"" so I am uncertain if the visual style in RFAD is his normal M-O, but I was thrilled.  The use of color, vibrant during the character's high points during these months, and sallow during the more prevalent low times was subtle yet stylishly done.  The frenetic cinematography is something that has been used often in the last couple of years and is becoming more and more mainstream, but I believe at this time it wasn't as overused as it is today.  Even if it is not original, it's effect is very heavy on the viewer. The use of drugs was primarily limited to very quick montages (similar to ones done in Snatch) that got the point across without being too graphic. Additionally, the scene with Ellen Burstyn waiting in the doctor's office in the last act of the film was extremely frightening, due in large part to the brilliant camera work and the sound.In regard to sound, I am very picky when it comes to music use in films. Being a product of an MTV generation and having studied video production I am sensitive to when music is appropriately placed in films.  The effective use of techno music in films is rare, Run Lola Run is one of the few films that come to mind, but I can add RFAD to this list.  The score is also extremely haunting; it compliments the action and the characters.Which brings me to the acting.  This movie would have simply been stylish with a decent story without the incredible performances of the four principle players.  Jared Leto was very good as Harry Goldfarb.  He conveyed the struggle between his reality and his drug-enhanced reality very well. I wasn't expecting much from the ""cute guy"" in My So Called Life.  And Marlon Wayans.. talk about not expecting much.  I'm not a big fan of comedic films unless they were made before 1960 generally, so I am not well schooled in the Wayans Family.  Marlon Wayans'character was less dimensional than Leto's but sympathetic nonetheless.  I've never been a fan of Jennifer Connelly. I remember sitting through her C-grade films in the 80's and early 90's with boyfriends who would readily admit she was a terrible actress but that she was a goddess because she was beautiful.  Of course, none of these films included a gorgeous male co-star (Frank Whaley? I think not.) so I couldn't dip into that superficial fantasy world that would make those films more endurable.  This movie was definitely a welcome change.  Whereas I was rolling my eyes during her early performance in the film, her acting drew me in to her character and eventually made me both pity and feel repelled by her.And finally, Ellen Burstyn.  This woman is not used enough.  I remember when she was nominated for an Oscar for this role, they showed her clip, then they showed her in the audience and I was literally shocked by both her beauty and the transformation into abject dowdiness in this role.  It is Burstyn's performance in this film that terrified me.  Perhaps it was because we actually see the origins of her addiction from beginning to end. Nevertheless, her performance made me ache.  It made my heart hurt.  I've seen Burstyn in several other films, but based on this film alone I want to see more.  She was amazing.For two days after I watched this movie, I sat back and had to figure out whether I liked this movie or not.   I knew that I liked the technical aspects, and having attended film school that's the first thing I base my opinion on.  During the weekend, the movie was always in the back of my head, but I still was sorting out whether or not I truly liked it.  Then this morning I came to a realization.  I liked this movie in the same light as I liked Schindler's List.  Both movies are brilliantly directed with excellent performances, and they were both extremely thought provoking. However, they are so heavy and compelling that one can't take it out to watch it on a regular basis without climbing into your own Bell Jar.Bottom Line:  A must-see.  Just make sure you don't watch it before you head to work at your gig as a Clown for Hire at little Susie's birthday party."

But man is it depressing. It's almost physically exausting to watch. It makes TRAINSPOTTING look like a Disney movie. It's like being trapped on a slow boat to Hell, without a good reason to be there. If you have to see this film, have a cocktail first, you're gonna need it."
Phillip-Riback,"Jul 31, 2013",10/10,"Connectivity and complexity of the characters are forcing us to really care (and be shocked) how will this movie end. The culmination of events is fantastic, achieving a phenomenal emphasis on loneliness and decadence of the characters. Innovation in framing the act of drugging leaves a remarkable impression on the viewer. If you ask me, this movie should be played to children in schools. In that way there would definitely be fewer drug addicts, because I do not know a better way of showing how these drugs can destroy someone's life. The music is also phenomenal, and also is the very end of the movie. This is one of those movies that will not leave you indifferent and for sure it is going to reflect on you long after seeing it. That's why this movie might not be everyone's cup of tea."
jabandrade,"Jan 17, 2021",9/10,"Everything that could be said about this film was said . Both by the critics and by the reviews posted here on IMDB. It is a spectacular film, depressing and very difficult to watch. End of conversation. But after watching the movie again, I have to express my indignation at the injustice committed by the Academy when it gave the Oscar Award to Julia Roberts and did not award the fantastic performance of Ellen Burstyn. In yet another of those historic Hollywood episodes that can never be repaired. Similar to the injustice of 1976, when Rocky was given the Oscar for Best Picture and overlooked the superb Network. Well, that's it. It is my record of indignation that I'm not satisfied with today, 20 years later."
alaneglinton,"Mar 8, 2020",9/10,"Not what I expected at all, it was so much more than a 'drugs are bad' movie, taking the disturbingly similar journeys of mother and son through the short lived highs and crushing lows of both their lives .
The performance of from Ellyn Burstyn as the loving but deeply troubled mother was absolutely mesmerising - deserving of the oscar nomination and in my view really should have won.
The cinematography and editing were were quite brilliant with a stunning soundtrack complimenting perfectly the mood and emotions on show.
A very dark and disturbing movie but also an absolute must see."
badgerthief,"Dec 16, 2004",10/10,"Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly unique film. Not just because of it's subject matter (drug use is hardly infrequent in films these days), but because of the feeling it gives the viewer during and for a long time after the film has ended.The best word to describe Requiem is 'heartbreaking'. It is shocking, disturbing, moving and heartbreaking. I won't give too much away but the feeling you get once the film has ended is one of extreme emptiness. I didn't know how to feel after the first time I'd watched it. I cried like a baby, but I felt more than just sadness. The second time I watched it, I watched the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the last fifteen minutes. The contrast is incredible, and it was this that made me feel so empty.The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans was excellent in a serious role, Jared Leto was perfect as Harry, who wants to do right by his loved ones and get rich at the same time. Jennifer Connelly portrays strong-willed Marion, who ultimately loses her dignity to get her fix. One of the most shocking things other than the film itself is the fact that Ellen Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. How the Academy could have thought anyone gave a better performance that year (or any other year for that matter) is beyond me. Her portrayal of Harry's desperately lonely mother is the key to this film being so powerful.Requiem for a Dream is a tragic film that grabs your emotions from the very beginning, takes them on a roller-coaster, then squeezes the life out of them before battering them to a pulp. The most incredible, breathtaking and ultimately heartbreaking film I've ever seen, and one that will remain at the top of my favourite films list for a long time to come. You may not be able to watch it more than once but I urge anyone to rent it out and give yourself the cinematic experience of a lifetime."
PyrolyticCarbon,"Nov 12, 2004",6/10,"For the most part this movie ambles along, caught up in a few stylistic touches that it doesn't quite manage to deliver. The repeating mundane and reinforcing dialogue and visuals just go to remind you of events and circumstance that you already know.However, it is in the second half of the film where it really gets its message forward. It shows how four peoples lives career out of control when drugs begin to take over their lives, and not all from the illegal point of view.From the second half it's a very interesting and compelling film, dropping to total despair by the last twenty minutes. The final sequence is one of the most harrowing to endure in the movies I've seen in the last few years, and tackles the issues head on without flinching.Overly stylised it certainly is, but if you can endure those moments and progress onto the latter part of the movie you will have a head on crash with the ending. Harrowing is hardly the word.I have to say, stunning performance from Jennifer Connelly, and an equally amazing and surprising show from Marlon Wayans. Dump that Wayans trade mark movie and get into the real thing."
glamrusxhpe,"Sep 26, 2007",10/10,"I have always heard about requiem for a dream from my friends and i found time to watch it and it was so excellent. The woman that plays Jare Leto's mother did an excellent job. all characters portrayed themselves so well. Wonderfully acted, the movie starts out with the mother of Harry played by Jared wanting to go on a diet to be a contestant on a television show so she does on a grapefruit & egg diet which is not working. She goes to a doctor to get diet pills, which eventually make her addicted.Harry and his friend start drug dealing, he needs it to live. Harry's girlfriend and him live together. They become desperate so Marion (Jared's gf) starts to sell herself for money.Their lives spiral out of control, and it's an emotional thing to watch. It really hits you in the heart, and tells you a thing about drugs and addiction. It makes you think and brings you on an emotional ride the whole movie.Excellent photography and visual elements. Sound effects were 'Realistic' sounding. I can't explain it.I think it is my all time favorite movie. Very well done."

I would of given it a higher mark as it is a 'good' film as it provokes an emotional response, however I would never wish anyone else to see the film as it isnt worth it."
masterdadu2006,"Feb 15, 2007",10/10,"I am in shock. Shock should be the word to describe this movie. It's truly a work of art. The colors, the images , all about this movie relates to art. It's a masterpiece. Darren Aronofsky put's you're mind in situations you couldn't imagine , the characters are extraordinary , the acting outstanding ,the music also is perfect ... i don't know , maybe Requim of a Dream relates somehow to Stanley Kubrick's "" A Clockwork Orange "" , it's that kind of quality that is very rare in the cinema industry that should put this movie in my opinion in a top 10 all time films. Maybe i am being subjective but you will have to sea this movie to understand what i really mean by that."
DerSongsurfer,"Jan 22, 2007",9/10,"I must have been 14 or 15 when accidentally I came to watch this movie. And I know that possibly that is not the right age to watch such a movie, but still... I think it was quite important for my development Although I did not dare to see it again since, all the images of the film are still somewhat burnt into my brain: It were some of the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen in movies so far and some were so dreadful I wasn't even able to cry. But this is, in my eyes, exactly what this film should be like! It shows every little piece of destruction in the lives of the protagonist, until the final end. Another aspect of the film that I truly liked was, that the mere showing of the damages, physically and mentally, without trying to be too moralistic and to spread wisdoms each of us has heard thousands of.I think I am ready to watch it again by now, but I have to say that this is not a film to see for pleasure. This is a film to show you everything you never wanted to see but ought to!10/10!"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Jun 12, 2009",10/10,"I have not read the novel upon that this is based upon. This has gotten very mixed reactions... is it almost criminally engaging and effective, or is it MTV-type manipulative drivel? I have to admit, I can't ignore the craftsmanship of this movie, so if you must place me in a booth, I'd be in the former of those two. The stylization is incredible and fitting. Editing and cinematography are accused of being gimmicky, with jump-cuts and this utilizing quite a few different angles and the Snorricam, but I disagree... they're part of Aronofsky's cinematic language. Whether he is a genius or a madman is open to debate. This is not easy to watch. It is rather cruel to the audience, and entirely uncompromising. It deals with addiction, in general, not only to drugs. The writing is impeccable, script, plot and dialog alike. All the characters are credible. The acting is amazing, yes, including Marlon Wayans, and Burstyn is, simply put, excellent, and utterly devastating in her performance. This has masterful music, the score is perfect and beautifully done. The one complaint that I particularly have is that, for three of the four leads, there is little to no explanation in this for how they came to use narcotics. I can imagine many viewers being deeply emotionally affected by this. The language is strong as it gets, and plentiful. While there is not a lot of violence in this, it's filled with disturbing content. There is also graphic sexuality. This is not something to watch if you aren't already relatively hardened. The DVD comes with trailers and TV spots, two of each, deleted scenes with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them, during them, a couple of featurettes, and lastly, a commentary track with the director, and one with Matthew Libatique. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the medium, provided they feel they have the nerves for it. 10/10"
Troll182,"Apr 9, 2007",10/10,"I first saw this when it was released on DVD when i worked at a video store and i recommended to as many people as i could. A few were amazed and many were shocked.But thats what i love in a film,something moving,gritty,shocking,grimy,confronting,and just plain different from the rest of the garbage out there. I know this has been said but the academy should be very ashamed for not awarding Ellen Burstyn HER Oscar. She was robbed. I only started watching them again this year to see Scorsese receive HIS statues (at last). Burstyns performance was just so heart wrenching I'm still amazed 7yrs later. Jared Leto showed us that he can really act, Jennifer Connelly (when she picks the right roles) can knocked you out and does so here and Marlon Wayons turns out a star making dramatic performance. Christopher Macdonald also deserves a big mention as Tappy Tibbons who i read that a lot of his lines were improvised. Nothing else to say but go watch it!"
k-howitt99,"Oct 13, 2014",10/10,"Darren aronofsky directs Jared Leto, Ellen burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans in this disturbing spiral of a film.The story centerers around four ""drug addicts"" the characters played by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans are all teenagers who start off dabbling in heroin, until it stars to dominate their life and starts to get out of control, the two boys start to get into very dangerous situations and Jennifer Connelly starts to get into prostitution. The key character however is Ellen burstyn, mother of Jared Leto who lives by herself sat in her armchair all day watching a day time television show. She receives a letter one day claiming that she has won a competition to be on television, of course she is over the moon but unfortunately she can't fit in to her old red dress. she comes to the conclusion that diet pills are the way forward but to her peril, she soon finds out that the pills are addictive and unhealthy. Her life starts to go the same way as her sons life.This film is one of the best examples if not the best of modern society and culture. Aronofsky will get a Lot of stick from some people about this film but he doesn't pull any punches and why should he? There is such a deep meaning here, even if it isn't finding nemo (great film) but aronofsky is saying that don't have a go at kids for drugs, because it is ingrained in our society he shows this by using Ellen burstyn, she is an innocent old lady and she becomes a drug addict, burstyn portrays her sweet innocence well but also the characters deranged side. What is very clever is for most of the film we know that the younger three are on heroin but we don't see them use it exactly until Jared Leto uses it in his infected arm. Perhaps the most chilling scene is where Jennifer Connelly ""performs"" in front of a crowd, just for some drugs, Jared Leto her boyfriend encourages her to do this but she doesn't seem to even hesitate with it.I'm not surprised that this film didn't win any Oscars etc this isn't a film that the ""higher powers"" would vote for but that doesn't take anything away from it.This film is a huge statement about our culture and one that some people won't like but as a teenager myself I would find requiem for a dream as a greater warning, as opposed to the kind of films they show you at school about drugs, this is nowhere near government propaganda as some of the others are but a realism story about how harmful drugs really are."
Mkaaff,"Dec 26, 2018",7/10,"From a viewer point of view, sometimes you like movies not to be so frank. Sometimes you prefer movies lie to you and let you get away from this ,somehow, ugly world. But if you are looking for this you should never watch this ""requiem for a dream"". This is a truely honest story of poor poeple engaging themselves with drugs and start destroying their not-so-beautiful life, second by second through the film. Like othe aronofsky films, the atmosphere is bothering in almost every scene, specially in the first 60 minutes. You might feel nothing about the film and want not to continue. But then the final 30-40 minutes arrives, everything changes, the atmosphere, the composition, the rhythm, everything, and it engages you with the story, with the characters, and then you can't move away. You want to find out where these people gonna reach. So you will stay with the film and you will follow it. To be honest the atmosphere remains bothering, torturing your mind and soul. But you are somehow surprised and you can't just let it go. So surely you will be more satisfied with yourself for choosing this film to watch when the final credits apear with that amaizing soundtrack in comparison to when you were watching the opening scenes with the same soundtrack.
Finally, perhaps this film is a little bit overrated with that 82 position among toprated 250 movies. But no doubt it is a very good, dark but honest movie you should watch. But only once because you can't and I think you don't want to watch it again. But you will always remember its amaizing brilliant soundtrack and you may want to listen to it again and again."

NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Apr 29, 2024",7/10,"It's taken me a longggg time to finally commit to watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream and now that I have, I have no earthly desire to ever, ever see it again. Aronofsky's filmography is a fascinating one for me personally; one of his films (The Fountain) is in my top three of all time and has endless rewatch capability, while every other one I've seen I've either not been huge on, or admired but felt like once was enough. That certainly applies here, this is a well made and thoughtful film yet it's pessimistic to the bone and so bleak in its outlook that you feel a dark stain on your soul when it's choking narrative of several Coney Island drug addicts comes to a hellish, cacophonous ending. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are a pair of sad sack heroin junkies, Jennifer Connelly is Leto's equally strung out girlfriend and Ellen Burstyn his hopeless mother who withers away at home, getting sicker and sicker on poisonous diet pills that rot her body, and a toxic daytime TV talk show (hosted by Christopher 'Shooter McGavin' McDonald, no less) that rots her mind. These various individuals each occupy their own disheartening downward spiral and weave in and out of each other's orbit as they all proverbially circle the toilet bowl of a very dark outcome and while there are momentary flashes of what could be called compassion for these people, Aronofsky mostly just ruthlessly focuses on this very disturbing, apocalyptic chapter in their lives with little room for rhyme, reason or philosophical commentary. Perhaps it's best that way for this film, and seems to mirror the lack of answers or understanding all of us seem to have when we drive through a particularly derelict part of town where these horrifying trajectories can be observed in real time. The film starts off with false hopes of being kind of comedic in the fashion of other drug films like Spun or The Salton see but, like those films, it's all fun and games in the beginning stages of addiction and when the situation becomes dire, things spiral into oblivion faster than anybody can comprehend, especially those it happens to. So, while I will concede it's a terrific film with solid performances and a now iconic score from Clint Mansell, I'll tuck the dvd away, change the channel when it comes on and skip past it in the streaming queue, for I have no inclination to ever experience it again."
charlz_manson,"Jun 15, 2001",1/10,"This movie struck me as utterly phony, which was surprising as Aronfsky's prior film, ""Pi,"" was amazing. Never once, from the very beginning, did I believe I was watching anything but specific actors play-acting. Ellen Burtsyn's thick slice of ham cut close to the bone was embarrassing, and her New York ""Jewish"" accent coming in a film released in the year 2000 struck me as outrageous! I mean, are we going back to ""The Goldbergs"" and 1950?The whole film struck me as ersatz, artificial -- it had this 1950 junkie sensibility of Selby grafted onto this ""hip hop"" style that was simply jarring. The screenplay, which was co-written with Selby, was so predictable I began amusing the woman I was watching the film with by actually giving her the next line. I was right too often for comfort. The massacre during the dope dealing sequence in the back of the supermarket not only was telegraphed far ahead, but was incredibly STUPID. I did not believe the scene for a minute. Is it supposed to be a dream? I ask that as it has NO LOGIC.Perhaps the biggest problem were the two leads -- Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. While their acting was quite good, they looked like they had deplaned at JFK from Beverly Hills that very morning. Connelly is too good looking for the role (she does not look the part of a junkie; in contrast, Samantha Morton, who granted is a better actress, looks the part of a junkie in ""Jesus's Son""); a woman that looks like Connelly could be a call girl making many thousands of dollars a night, which made her ""descent"" into hell ridiculous. What is the problem with her character: she's just plain stupid?Leto looks like a male model. (There used to be an old joke when I was a kid: Funny, it don't look Jewish. Leto, whose character I assume is at least half Jewish, looks as pure Irish as Connelly; in fact, they look enough alike to be brother and sister, which I'm sure was intentional but which was downright weird.)The ending, the denouement of the three main characters' stories, was so over-the-top that my friend and I began laughing out loud. (I will say, Burstyn was excellent during the harrowing scene of the force feeding. The look on her face of pain, humiliation and resignation was haunting -- a great moment in screen acting.) Just intercutting two of the stories, son and mother, would have been enough, but the sexual imagery and situation of Connelly's character was so evocative of a throwing everything in but the kitchen sink mentality, we just couldn't stop howling. I mean -- COME ON! I'm chuckling right now thinking of the scene. It certainly dissipated the power of the son's horror (though not that of Burstyn, due to the great control she displayed in her acting; perhaps Aronfsky should learn the value of SUBTLTY from that part of her performance).I think people were wowed by the directoral pyrotechnics, but frankly, this film's triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse!"
rmax304823,"Feb 22, 2003",N/A,"The story of four people who get too much into drugs, it poses several questions, not all of them about drugs.  One of them is, how stylized can movies become before they are so thoroughly stylized that they lose their narrative roots?  It's rather like music in some respects.  At one end of the dimension, which I won't try to name, there is a simple tune like, oh, ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"" which is easy to remember, fun to whistle, cute, and rudimentary (although Mozart did some very odd things with it). At the other, three minutes and some seconds of silence.  In movies, at the simple end, we can have, say, a one-hour film consisting of nothing but the same shot of the Empire State Building.  At the other end of the dimension we might get something resembling what one sees in a kaleidoscope while stoned.  (Or maybe we come back to the Empire State Building; maybe it's not a dimension at all, but a circle.)This one certainly hasn't lost touch with the events it describes but it's pretty highly stylized too, as far as the direction, photography, editing, and sound are concerned.  Sometimes this stylization works to support the narrative and sometimes it doesn.  Sometimes it actually works against it. Example:  all of the drugged-up scenes are in fast motion, including those involving, not just speed, but marijuana and heroin.  The hyped-up action we get while Ellen Burstyn is on diet pills is evocative, peppy, full of accelerated business.  But heroin doesn't work that way.  And marijuana practically ablates one's sense of the passage of time so that, for instance, it sometimes seems to take half an hour to urinate -- so they tell me.  If you stop using speed abruptly you can get some wizard hallucinations.  But no one hallucinates on heroin, although this film suggests they do.  The result is that the stylization is sometimes over the top, not slowing down enough to give us a chance to take a breath.  It's nerve jangling and leaves the viewer a neural shambles.  The performances are fine, by everyone concerned.  In particular, Jennifer Connoley has by far her juiciest role and, somewhat surprisingly, is up to it.  Burstyn is excellent too, her accent pretty well Brooklynized.  But some of that shredding of sensibilities is unearned and unnecessary.  The editing is increasingly jumpy and shocking, though it never leaves us in doubt of where we are or who we are with.  The score is a blend of mostly scratchy, unpleasant electronics and ordinary sounds with the gain on high -- each pill accompanied by a ""plop"" on the sound track, each flick on a lighter by a ""pfft,"" and so on.  (Sometimes it sounds like a Popeye cartoon.)  The photography too is highly distinctive.  Fisheye lenses abound here. Cameras are fixed by harness onto an actor's body so that the actor's face and shoulders are immobile while the background seems to swivel around him and he walks and turns corners.  The effect is so disturbing that it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.I found Aranovsky's earlier film, Pi, plan irritating and depressing because of the high-contrast photography and other directorially imposed effects. This one is depressing too, but less irritating because, despite the high style, a story is being carried, and the story is about characters we care something about.  They may be self absorbed, like the subject of ""Pi,"" but they're hardly self confident.  Their weaknesses are pathetic but entirely recognizable.  Ellen Burstyn wants to lose weight so she can look good in that red dress, just as she did at her son's graduation.  She pursues the cultural ideal of slenderness and youthfulness.  Her son and his pardners in euphoria pursue the cultural ideal of pleasuring one's self.  The drugs could be a neat stand in for the values that prevail in our community currently.  Why else, except out of a desire to look good, would people buy a three-hundred-dollar simulacrum of a rowboat and use it so regularly? Why else, except out of a desire to feel pleased with one's self, would anyone buy a forty-thousand-dollar ten-gallon-per-mile Suburban Assault Vehicle with a revolving machine gun turret atop it?  Hey!  Look at me, everybody, I'm young, beautiful, and happy!  Of course I can't figure out why I'm alive, but I don't ask myself that question.This is an extremely innovative film, but the director has made clear his admiration of earlier movies, including ""The Panic in Needle Park"" (the same general idea), ""The Godfather"" (ominous oranges), ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (""Feed me, Sara!""), and maybe ""Koyaanisqatsi"" (the acceleration of the cuts, tempo, and onscreen movements from moderato at the beginning to molto agitato towards the end).It left me saddened and panting for breath.  I'm not sure I'd like to sit through it too often, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to miss it."
frenchman_66,"Oct 29, 2020",10/10,"This is a devastating movie. It isn't easy to watch; you hurt for these people and their lives as you are caught up in seeing the spiral of their addictions. Great performances all around. The director's visual style leaves you off balance at times,(love his visuals) but its an important part of the film. Gritty, emotional, devastating especially that final scene as the camera pulls away. Fantastic filmmaking, acting, soundtrack is hypnotic but be ready for an emotional experience seldom seen on film."

It will be that ""what if"" scenario that will haunt you for the rest of yout life!This is the first time I have watched this movie and It was a blend of awe and disgust! The movie itself is EXPERTLY crafted, but the subjectmatter and story, is something i have no desire to revisit! Its like that spiral descending slowly into misery! Much like ""Grave of the fireflies"" AMAZING but also so depresimg that you might not wanna come back and see it again!I HAVE to praise the directing, editing and soundtrack! It perfectly captures what It meams to be caught in addiction! Its overwhelming, takes control and never lets go! The choice of edition gives of a very uncomfortable vibe! Almost a sense of ""I can't escape this""... and a sense of unease!Adiction takes away dreams!"
jacobmorel-21340,"May 18, 2022",10/10,"Requiem for a dream is one movie of many about drugs but this one really sticks it's landing. It's a tear jerker, a stomach churning drama, and an exciting thrill ride. Words can not describe how good this movie is. Saying it's a great movie that is up there as one of the best movies of all time, Goes against the saddening subject that the movie is really about. The movie centers on the life of drug addiction. And there is nothing good let alone great about drug addiction. Addiction is a very complicated and challenging situation for those who are addicted to a substance and those affected by the ones they love who are addicted to a substance. But Darren aronofskys ""requiem for a dream"" shows what the most brutal, maniacal, deprived, and sadistic look at drug addiction can be like. And again to say this movie is great is very contradictory to how it feels to watch this movie. It is very horrifying and sickening to watch at times but the overall movie is great. Those who appreciate film and can understand and appreciate the quality of a story no matter how vile the story may be, will truly love this movie. I will leave spoilers out of this review so people can see and judge the movie for themselves. But I will say Ellen Burstyns character in the movie is one of the best characters I've seen in my whole life her acting is flawless and she deserves a round of applause for her performance."
requiems,"Mar 9, 2014",10/10,"Most reviews will either be a 1/10 or a 10/10, those who gave it a 1 never gave it a chance, never opened there mind or saw pass the technicalities of it all. I gave it a 10 because I hate how this movie made me feel, I've never been more disgusted at life than after seeing this movie. When the credits came up, I started crying and stared at the watch next movie sign on the rental screen for a good half an hour. I couldn't bring myself to watch anything or thing of anything but this film. A movie that induces that much thought after the fact deserves a 10. Even those who don't like it because of it's disturbing theme, to admit that it was so powerful to disturb someone is to admit that it is worth the highest rating for being that powerful.I went in this movie thinking it would be like ""The Basketball Diaries"" I was really wrong. It's not just another story about drug addicts, it's not trying to shove it's meaning down your throat and it's not meant to scare your children out of taking drugs as we all know doesn't work. This movie is a piece of art. The way it's shot is one of a kind, the music helps every scene to be more powerful and the acting is so down to earth you really believe the struggle they are going through. Jared Leto, playing Harry Goldfarb gives the best performance of his career and in the end you will cry for him because you sympathize so much with him. Ellen Burstyn gave an incredible performance as well and her story is the most haunting because it's her story that makes you realize this can happen to anyone and everyone.I can't honestly say I'd recommend this to anyone but I can honestly say I could, at the same time. It's a movie so powerful and haunting I could never watch again but I feel as if everyone should see this. It's a story about life and the craving you have. Whether it is sugar, TV, sex or drugs, we all have cravings and they can bring out the worst in us and this movie shows how they can go terribly wrong if we don't realize our addictions."
Tweekums,"Feb 7, 2019",9/10,"In the summer four residents of Coney Island dream of better times. Widow Sara Goldfarb spends her days watching self-help programmes on television; then one day she gets a phone call inviting her to be on a show... she is determined to go on wearing her favourite red dress. Unfortunately she is a little too large for it; dieting doesn't work so she turns to pills. Her son Harry and his friend Tyrone are regular drug users who have a plan to fund their habit and raise money for a better life by turning to dealing... all goes well till their supply is shut off. Harry's girlfriend Marion is also using and resorts to prostituting herself to get her fix.It must be stated that this film isn't easy viewing; in the opening scene we see Harry taking his mother's television to pay for a fix. Then, even as things are getting better for him, we see his mother drawn into a different but no less dangerous addiction... prescribed by a doctor. As summer turns to autumn things get much grimmer and one wonders just how bad things will get... and it gets worse. Director Darren Aronofsky's use of rapid cuts captures the manic urgency of the addicts' lives. The cast is impressive; in particular the four leads; Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb; Jared Leto as Harry; Jennifer Connelly as Marion and Marlon Wayans as Tyrone. They really make us believe in their characters as their lives descend into a nightmare. Overall I'd certainly recommend this but prepare to be disturbed."
Official_Tunka,"Dec 27, 2023",6/10,"As the credits rolled and the hauntingly intense score of Clint Mansell reverberated in my ears, I sat there in stunned silence, my mind grappling with the visceral impact of Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream."" This cinematic masterpiece, released over two decades ago, is a raw and unflinching exploration of addiction that left me both emotionally shaken and deeply reflective. In the aftermath of this harrowing journey into the abyss of substance abuse, I found an unexpected source of motivation to steer clear of the perilous path of drugs.""Requiem for a Dream"" presents a stark portrayal of addiction through the intertwined lives of four characters: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), his best friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn). The film follows their descent into the chaotic and destructive world of drug abuse, depicting the harrowing consequences that spiral out of control with relentless momentum.The film's unflinching realism is a testament to Aronofsky's directorial prowess. From the pulsating visuals to the tight editing, every frame serves as a stark reminder of the corrosive power of addiction. The characters' struggles become a reflection of the broader societal issues surrounding substance abuse, providing a chilling snapshot of the cyclical nature of addiction and its pervasive impact on individuals and their relationships.What struck me most profoundly was the film's ability to evoke empathy and compassion for the characters despite their flawed decisions. As I witnessed their dreams crumble and their lives unravel, I felt a profound connection to the very human vulnerability that underlies the destructive lure of drugs. The characters weren't just cautionary tales; they were complex individuals with dreams, desires, and ultimately, a desperate need for escape from the harsh realities of their lives.Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sara Goldfarb is nothing short of a tour de force. As her character succumbs to the seductive promises of a weight-loss television show and amphetamines, Burstyn captures the devastating toll that addiction takes on both the mind and body. The haunting transformation of Sara from a hopeful dreamer to a shell of her former self serves as a poignant metaphor for the destructive allure of substances.The film's powerful impact lies not only in its portrayal of the downward spiral but also in its portrayal of the brief moments of euphoria that keep the characters ensnared in the web of addiction. The rapid-fire editing, coupled with Clint Mansell's haunting soundtrack, creates an immersive experience that pulls the audience into the characters' highs and lows. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that left me breathless and contemplative.As the final credits rolled, I found myself grappling with a profound sense of gratitude. ""Requiem for a Dream"" didn't just shock me into submission; it served as a powerful reminder of the preciousness of life and the importance of steering clear of the self-destructive allure of drugs. The film illuminated the destructive consequences that can befall even the most well-intentioned individuals when they succumb to the tempting escape offered by substances.In conclusion, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the boundaries of traditional storytelling. It's an unapologetic exploration of the dark underbelly of addiction, leaving an indelible mark on anyone brave enough to witness its brutal honesty. As I sit here, haunted by the images and emotions the film evoked, I am profoundly grateful for the wake-up call it provided. ""Requiem for a Dream"" isn't just a movie; it's a visceral experience that has motivated me to stay resolute in my commitment to a life free from the destructive grip of drugs."

vdub,"Jan 23, 2003",1/10,"I cannot believe the high ratings this movie has gotten. This is one of the most superficial and one-dimensional films I have ever seen. I grant you that Ellen Burstyn did a fine job, but what about the rest of the story? It seemed to me to be something Nancy Reagan might have written and produced. The seeming demise of Harry and Marion at the end showed how little the actors and Aronofsky know about the descent into drug addiction.What was really disappointing was that although Aronofsky demonstrated interesting techniques in ""Pi,"" he never really developed them in this film.I don't understand why everyone was so deeply affected by this film."
TheFilmWook,"Sep 30, 2020",10/10,"Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that I can clearly look back upon, and remember the first time I watched it. It was with my roommates in college (Go Sun Devils) and once the end credits rolled, the room was completely silent. No one said a thing for a good five minutes. The images going through my head was similar to Jay Rabinowitz' editing in the film. Having gone through a battle with drug addiction myself, this one hit home pretty damn hard. That was six years ago. Now when I watch Requiem for a Dream, I admire it for what it is. A brilliantly told story about four Coney Islanders whose lives spiral out of control over the course of a single year. Addiction slowly breaks them down and we, the audience, have front row seats to the horror show that slowly develops. The camera angles and quick cuts practically teleport us into their dark, drug fueled world and the music in the background makes every shot eerie. Clint Mansell provides that score which intensifies every scene by 100. There are no winners in this film. If you think you will find redemption in these characters, stop looking, because you will find none. The phenomenal acting alone will make you cringe in your chair for each character makes you believe that they are truly suffering horribly. Ellen Burstyn provides the performance of a lifetime. One of the best acting performances I have ever seen in a movie. Leto, Connelly and Wayans are brilliant as well, but Burstyn takes the cake in this one. If you are in a good mood and watch this, it will be gone by the time this is over. If you watch in a bad mood, it will only get worse. I know I am not making the film seem enticing, but if you have not seen it, I suggest you do. Like it or not you will come away with something. It is the way in which the story is told, the editing, score and acting that come together to create the masterpiece that is Requiem for a Dream."

dogmaticdogs,"Sep 8, 2018",10/10,"I watch a lot of movies, and this is definitely one of the top 10 movies ever made in my opinion. It is not easy to watch, and not a feel good movie. It will get under your skin, and make you think for days. Nothing is predictable or derivative. Rather, it is just mind blowing creativity. I watch most movies and can think of at least 10 ways they could have been better. When I watched this one, I realized this guy was a master, there was nothing I could have done to improve this. It was very humbling in that regard. It really takes you deep into the mind of an addict in a manner that changed film making for eternity. Standing ovations for this one. Be ready for a jarring emotional impact. It may be more than some can handle."
CJ_Thorpe,"Sep 2, 2017",10/10,"An unflinching, dark, gritty exploration into the life of an addict with no hope and no positivity. It still holds up as perfect example of excellent film making. Every shot is purposeful and conveys the emotional impact of the situations on the characters. No second is wasted.The pacing builds with the film, beginning with long, slow scenes and becoming quicker cut as the tension builds. The soundtrack mirrors this progression, starting with orchestral pieces and moving into more aggressive electronic sounds. After about an hour of the slow build the film then just repeatedly punches you in the gut for the remaining 30 minutes and leaves me, for one, feeling empty inside after and I love it. This is what cinema should do make you feel.The themes of dependency run throughout the film. The addiction to diet pills and television that Sarah Goldfarb suffers from parallels the drug addiction of Harry and Co. and are shown to be equally as destructive, both mentally and physically. Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sarah Goldfarb is superb. During a scene where she is explaining her crippling loneliness her lips quiver and break into the occasional, subtle, nervous smile, which is a something that you just don't see from lesser actors. Each scene with the young cast (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) is juxtaposed with a scene of Sarah to further show how any addiction has the power to control you and it is the lack of control that ultimately takes your life away.The film is littered with extreme close up, quick cuts of drug taking which reflect the constant, unescapable repetition that the characters live.I could probably write an entire essay about the genius of ""Requiem for a Dream"" (I have barely mentioned the cinematography, lighting or sound design) but ill stop here for now."
themovieguy-02393,"Oct 16, 2020",9/10,This is one of those films... It's great but it makes you feel awful. I still think about it but that's not a pleasant experience. You SHOULD watch this but you won't enjoy it
alexanderramirez-65010,"Jun 19, 2021",10/10,"One of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and it's curious that it is not a horror movie . So realistic, and so sad at the same time. It's the life itself. Soundtrack is so epic, and definitely a ""must-watch"" film for anyone."
moritzherz,"Apr 11, 2023",7/10,"The task of a movie is to entertain its audience. This is a fact since we are speaking of an entertainment media. However does this not forbid to treat topics that are not entertaining, like anti-war or, in this case, anti-drug movies. Because entertainment does not mean a happy ending and a lot of laugh, it can be everything, from a good story, to just incredible visual effects or an important message that may even be relevenat to your own life.Requirm for a dream is not a feel good movie, it is a feel bad movie. It handles the drug topic and manages to warn the audience with its dark tone and uncomfortable scenes. It also impresses with a unique camera work and a phenomenal soundtrack. So this movie has everything a great movie needs.You should watch this film because it is important and could change your life!"
bbqballs,"Feb 14, 2009",7/10,"Well the title says it all doesn't it, this movie certainly was a Requiem for a Dream. What a brutal, tell-all film that does not hold back on anything. This film focuses on the issue of Drug addiction, and how something that started out as a small addiction can lead to catastrophic events beyond belief. Throughout the movie I was thinking: ""by the end of this film I am going to be in shock"", but to be honest I was not as shocked or in disbelief as much as I thought I would be. But I think this is due to the fact that these days we have been subjected to so much knowledge about drug addiction and we see so much of it that I guess we have become desensitized to the issue since the movie was made (2000). Overall it was a very well made film with some really interesting camera and editing techniques that you do not see used that much anymore. The acting was amazing; Ellen Burstyn who played Sara Goldfarb was absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Connelly was astonishing as Marion Silver, My god that would have been a hard role to play but wow did she pull it off, and quite fantastically I might add. This film is definitely not for the weak at heart and it will leave you thinking and somewhat shocked long after you have turned it off. 7.5/10"
tetsujin28,"Sep 2, 2001",1/10,"Following up his pseudo-intellectual claptrap ""Pi"", Aronofsky gives us another example of his inability to direct anything other than an hour and a half long music video. And a poor one at that. Any comparisons to ""A Clockwork Orange"" are completely off the mark. While I'm no fan of that movie, either, I'll admit that Kubrick had talent.Basically, rather like some other inexplicably popular movies, such as ""Boogie Nights"", this movie is akin to being stuck in a room full of crackheads for two hours, and we're supposed to find it not only interesting, but tragic. Sorry, but no go. I care not one whit for any of the characters in this movie, and wish they'd all just go away.For me, this is the filmic equivalent of one of those books you get so mad at, that you just want to throw it across the room."
lizettemejia98,"Aug 29, 2000",N/A,"Its been two hours since I saw this movie, and I'm still having trouble concentrating or just being able to type. This movie is very powerful,& difficult to watch, but it does hit the nail on the head with its poignant and pathetic portrayal of four very lost souls searching for a happy life. Ellen Burstyn's performance is of Academy Award caliber. I'll be looking for her name this year for Best Actress. She is phenomenal! My heart broke for her.  All performances were masterful,intense, and believable. This movie is not for the squeamish. It deals with real life situations of these four people that makes it sometimes hard to watch, but at the same time cinematically brilliant. Thought provoking and depressingly disturbing when it goes to places that you know exist, but do not have to deal with, unless your old and alone with no one in your life, or a  lost teenage heroine addict in N.Y. I liked this movie but don't know if I could sit through it again.  It should be shown in all re-hab facilities as an eye opener, or to people who ignore or neglect their old parents."
michaelmckinlay-52925,"Apr 26, 2022",10/10,"As a recovering heroine addict myself, I can assure you that the depiction of junky life in this movie is very accurate.I don't know what research Aranofsky did but he got it right. Junky life really is like this, it's a decent into madness and deprivation when at the end nothing matters except where the next score will happen.This is a very brave filmmaker to show what it's really like to be an addict."
Abalister,"Sep 4, 2014",10/10,"I'm sitting here, in September 2014, thinking of my all-time favourite movies, and Requiem for A Dream has been there, on top of my list, for 14 years.I have never felt such raw emotion watching a movie; before and after Requiem's release. I went through all possible kinds of emotions watching this masterpiece. I've seen it probably 20 times over the years and the result is always the same. It's a jaw-dropping experience. I remember hearing the soundtrack the first time in 2000, while watching the movie, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was added to the 3 seasons of the movie. The soundtrack has been used many times since then for commercials, trailers and whatnot, but to me, this is the Requiem's soundtrack.The 4 main acting performances in the movie are perfection. I connected with all of them. The cinematography, the editing and the directing are still amongst the best I've ever seen. The movie doesn't age at all. I always wondered why it wasn't up for many Oscars? (Picture, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, Supp Actor and Supp Actress). I guess not many people saw the movie when it came out in the Fall of 2000.This is movie perfection, an experience I will never forget, one of the best movies ever made, a tragic story but yet so close to what many humans must go through in their regular lives.If someone out there has not seen this masterpiece, I envy you. I wish I could re-live the 2 hours I went through the first time I saw this. A moment I will never forget. A must-have in any movie collection. A movie for the cinephiles."
alice-87011,"Feb 10, 2020",10/10,I promise you will experience emotions you didnt know existed when watching this film. The edit means you are tripping just as much as the characters through their highs and low. Absoloute masterpiece!!
Mrohnoes,"Apr 5, 2014",10/10,"Over on the ""Noah"" board, I made a thread wherein I expressed my opinion on that film. I also mentioned that it was the first Darren Aronofsky film that I had ever seen, which surprised the people who read my review, and so they recommended a few of Aronofsky's films, and the one that was recommended the most was Requiem For A Dream. And so, I rented the film off of Amazon, and gave it a watch, unprepared for what I was about to witness.Requiem For A Dream is like no other film I've ever seen, and even now, as I type this, I'm still attempting to figure out what I make of the film, but I will do my best to put my thoughts into a cohesive manner, so here it goes:I was going to start off by talking about how the film handles its depiction of people doing drugs, but I'd rather you look up Confused Matthew's review of the film, he discusses it better than I ever could, so instead, I'm only going to talk about the performances and the direction.Everyone in this film gave great performances. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and especially Ellen Burstyn (who deserved her Oscar nomination) each turn in some of the best acting I've ever seen from each of them, and that helped give each of their characters extra depth.Then, there's the directing by Aronofsky. The way he shot and edited the film is REALLY trippy and bizarre, but it works, because it gives you the feeling that you too are on drugs, which gives the audience a little bit of insight as to what the characters experience when they, you know, ""do the good stuff"". And you could also say that it helps the audience know why the characters do the drugs in the first place.Oh, and the ending to the film? Without a doubt one of the darkest endings I've ever seen in a film, and yet it's somewhat poignant in its message. I refuse to tell you what happens in it, just so you know.If you haven't seen this movie, I wholeheartedly recommend it, but I will warn you that you will not, I repeat NOT, be prepared for what you will see."
mohamadbr-87024,"Mar 26, 2022",10/10,"It's very rare to watch a movie or a show and you don't get bored during the whole thing not even a second, the movie from the beginning to the end kept moving the story toward its end and kept developing its characters... small and meaningful conversations, no wasted scenes no boring and nonsense conversations, the music was beyond great and it played a huge role to make me invested more into the events and with the great production and the great acting, I felt all characters emotions as I were one of them.Finally and most importantly the message behind the storytelling is incredible something that will stick in your mind for years and it will definitely affect your personnel life, it was clear and very easy to understand. What a great movie well done that's really a peak art."

bk753,"Jul 10, 2024",8/10,"As the credits rolled and I thought about what to say here, my first thoughts were that ""this was almost as much an expose' or a documentary than it was a feature film."" Obviously it's fiction, but it so hauntingly captures the brutality of drug addiction in EVERY unsavory aspect, that it's almost a beautifully produced 2 hour ""just say no"" public service announcement designed to scare you straight. This movie is hardcore and not for the faint of heart.It's stark and riveting with crazy real characters & situations and crackling dialogue that takes you right into the lives of four tortured souls. It's power and message on the evils of drug abuse is a baseball bat to the face, and the four leads are incredible in their depictions of the euphoric highs and catastrophic lows of addiction. It's truly worth seeing, but be warned... you will respect and appreciate the story and the efforts by all involved... but you will potentially not ""like"" the movie. Buckle in and prepare to be stunned."
tylervizek,"Jan 27, 2019",7/10,Different than anything I've ever seen. It constantly goes. Never stops. There's a tempo to it almost which made me respect the film but it gave me a headache the entire time. It was almost displeasing.it kept me awake
cwarne_uk,"Feb 23, 2003",1/10,"Yet another highly praised ""hard hitting"" film that turns out to be quite frankly rubbish. Clever editing can't disguise the fact that this turns out to be little more than ""Reefer Madness"" in fashionable clothes. As inaccurate about the drug milieu as it is about psychiatry (ECT is done on anaethetized subjects - but obviously that does not film as well). Abysmally written and acted - Ellen Burstyns performance is straight out of a 40's b-movie. Immature and flashy - which probably explains the quite ridiculous IMDB grading."
tedg,"Aug 12, 2001",N/A,"There is already a glut of films on drug addiction. Filmmakers love this subject just as actors love to play mentally handicapped characters. In a comment on one of them, I plan to provide a survey of this and how addiction of the subject feeds the addiction it depicts. But not here, because what is interesting about this film is not that Aronofsky started with a notion of a world and might have successfully portrayed it. Rather the interesting thing is that he has a particular style of film-making that seems inflexible, and his problem is to find that one subject that is apt for the style.Consider Terry Gilliam, the visual pythonista. He's very talented in creating quirky worlds with odd juxtapositions of props and sets. And he understands self-reference, the type found in British humor. But his overall sense of profundity is thin, and his mastery of narrative immature. So while his films are interesting in the sense that unlikely accidents attract attention, they are generally disappointing and messy. That is, until 'Fear and Loathing.' That's because the drugged mind is precisely composed of odd juxtapositions and weak profundities. And Gilliam's sense of self-reference (aided by Depp) is able to combine his condition with Hunter's. It works; it works well.Now turn to Aronofsky. He comes from a different visual tradition, one where slicing and dicing is the rule. Its not so much what the camera sees but how it sees it that is important. His first product: 'Pi,' was a spectacular mess. That's because he assumed that mathematically induced hallucinations were something drug-like, and that mathematics was arithmetic, and that the connection between mystical cosmologies and axiomatic dissonance was something simple. No one noticed the lemonade-stand approach, because there may only be a couple dozen people alive who know uncontrolled mathematical visual worlds, and there is scant literature on this to be found.Here, he turns to something that everyone thinks they know: simple erosion of the mind and will from drugs. Here, his cinematic approach is more apt. He shuffles, he jiggles and follows, he splits, he injects a repeating snap when the character does. Burstyn does an Emily Watson and completely bares her pathetic soul, and we are shocked at the supposed cost to her personally. The camera does succeed in intensifying the documentary feel, so the blur between character and actor is increased.So both Aronofsky and Gilliam have now produced, with the aid of talented performers, the one decent film their styles can accommodate unless they mature. What then? Well, in Aronofsky's case, it could be to develop the other thing he has done here -- he has created a somewhat masterful narrative of frustrated dreams. Personally, I prefer the understatement of 'Stranger than Paradise,' to the continual beating of the obvious we have here. But the self-referential notion of the fabricated TeeVee image defining this woman's hopes, mirrored by the similarly fabricated Movee image defining (not merely reporting) the loss of those hopes shows a promising narrative mastery.Let's hope he works on that for a few films and takes the Ridley Scott approach to growth on the cinematic side: do stuff you don't understand and develop the ability to adapt the vision to the narrative, not the other around. Not the other way around."
seen-deadly-sins,"Oct 10, 2006",10/10,"I had unfortunately already spoiled this film for myself by going to Wikipedia but decided to be a good sport and watch the entire movie as well. The actors give superb performances. Ellen Burstyn is tragic and realistic (that Oscar was stolen from her). Jared Leto as the gaunt Harry Goldfarb is amazing. To those that never pictured him as a good lead actor, he will awe you to the point of tears. Which is exactly what happened to me. The impact of the film hit me on the head like a board. This film is not for those looking for light-hearted entertainment or a little action flick. This explores the intense reality of drug abuse and addiction and the consequences it brings about to the four protagonists. A difficult film to watch but a must-see for everyone."
rdrell,"Nov 6, 2006",8/10,"This movie is out of this world. That's the only way to describe it. It was incredible, yet I felt like I wanted to kill myself afterward. It really goes into the depths of some really twisted lives. The cinematography is absolutely unbeatable and really adds to an otherwise seemingly boring movie. I have nothing but good things to say about this flick except that you should really only see it if you need feelings of depression to compliment your already low-on-life attitude. Jared Leto actually did a wonderful job as the lead, and of course Ellen Burstyn stole the show. As a first time viewer of the movie with a friend of mine, my friend commented that she thought it was such a great movie, but could never watch it again. It's understandable. People that own this movie should really be questioned as border-line depressed or addicts. This movie can really be used in different contexts."
off2theraces,"Jan 21, 2025",8/10,"The best anti-drug propaganda film ever made. I feel sick after watching this movie. Not because of how gross the scenes were, but the way it was edited, the soundtrack and the plot made it hard on a mental level. But still a good movie. How can you call it a bad movie when it can achieve such empathetic results. I took a long reprieve after watching it. I swore I would never do drugs in my life. I'm not interested in drugs at all now. Also, I wouldn't watch this movie a second time despite it being a good movie. Because it's too damn hard for me! It makes me feel like I'm the one who overdosed!😭😭😭"
Heavenly Creature,"Aug 31, 2001",8/10,"Requiem for a Dream is not a film I will be watching again.  Not because I didn't find it absoloutely stunning, both visually and psychologically.  I did.  It's because of those reasons that I will not be watching it again.Some films touch you in a way that the standard Hollywood blockbuster yawn-fests can't.  They ground you, force you to take a look at your life, and the lives of others around you.  They show you what is going on in the world, a world which many of us have been protected from all our lives. Requiem for a Dream is one of these rare movies.From the claustrophobic opening sequence, to the horrific finale, the film takes you on a journey that you will never completely recover from.  It shows us the lives of four addicts who want to become something better, but merely become shadows of their former selves.The acting is simply breathtaking.  At times, it feels like you are watching a documentary because of the impressive casts realistic performances.  Jared Leto is fast becoming one of my favourite actors, taking roles which fight against the ordinary.  His Hollywood good looks (thankfully hidden in this film) mean that he could become the new Leo Dicaprio or (God Forbid) Ben Affleck if he wanted to, but his roles in Fight Club, American Psycho and now this show his true acting abilities.Ellen Burstyn is the real revelation, though.  She is absoloutely astounding the gameshow-obsessed mother who wants nothing more than to fit into a little red dress for a TV appearence.  Her scenes with Jared Leto brought a tear to my eye everytime - the two had a real connection.If I have one gripe about this film, it's Aronofsky's complex and much-heralded use of camera angles.  There is no denying that this man is a technical genius, and there are times when these camera shots are genuinely effective.  But most of the time they distract from his amazing cast.  The film works much better when he simply takes a break and lets the superb acting take precedence.Like I said at the start of this review, I will not be watching Requiem for a Dream again.  My one viewing of it is enough to last me a life time.  But everyone from fifteen upwards should be forced to watch this film once, if only to highlight the awful price of addiction."
RenoirSoda,"May 30, 2020",9/10,"The film also uses very unique editing and shooting techniques, making every shot very popular, but it looks shocking. This is the darkest part of the movie I have come into contact with. People say it is an anti-drug movie. Although there is no mention of any anti-drug word in the movie, when we see the sad ending of the four characters in the play At that time, we will understand the terrible drug, it will destroy a person, a home, and even the entire society. Yes, this movie does express this view."
perafancho,"Jul 26, 2002",9/10,"When I decided to start my DVD collection, I decided it had to be composed by only the best available titles.  I did not want to fill my cases with summer blockbusters which lacked storylines, but wasted special effects. I wanted true filmmaking, preferably independent.  We all know that Hollywood has their stars and their money, but most of their movies lack everything a real movie should have.  Someone recommended Requiem for a Dream, so I read reviews about it here on IMDB.  I proceeded to purchase it and view it with some of my friends.  We were absolutely impressed.The story is so strong it leaves deep marks in those who view it.  Hubert Selby Jr. wrote a great novel, and he and Aronofsky did a terrific job in turning it into a screenplay.  The decadence of human beings of different ages, races and sex is true in everyday life, and the movie does not hide it.  It is strong and is shown as it should be.The performances are brilliant.  Ellen Burstyn gives her best with the role of Sara Goldfarb.  Jennifer Connelly, besides her beauty, portrays a perfect Marion, who takes advantage of that beauty in pursuit of a dream.  Jared Leto and Mr. Wayans do not fall behind, not to mention Christopher MacDonald as Tappy Tibbons.  Their interaction onscreen is absolutely marvelous and they never let the story fall apart, unlike the lives of the characters they play.The music is great.  Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet provide a solid musical background in every scene.  The soundtrack is so good everybody I know comments about it and some, including myself, have it constantly playing in our computers.  It is strong, it is suspenseful, it is brilliant.The directing by Aronofsky is excellent.  I saw Pi after seeing Requiem and I was impressed by how much this director can put into a movie with so little experience, but not little talent.  It is directors like these what films need, not greedy producers who want to make money out of the dumbest ideas.  Filmmaking should be an art, not a business.  Picasso didn't paint or sculpt to live in riches.  Neither did Beethoven or Mozart when they composed their symphonies.  As a matter of fact, most of them lived rather normal lives, contrasting with the opulency of those who now buy their belongings or works at auctions.  Thank you, Mr Aronofsky, for being a true artist."
tweekville,"Dec 11, 2019",7/10,"There are a few films out there that are able to combine beauty and our broken world. In a fantastically perfect image, they show things for what they are and how the people in these situations are truly broken or become broken.This is perhaps the greatest example of such a film.Stylistically, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is great to watch. You see it and it's beautiful. While at the same time, you are seeing some of the worst case scenarios of drug addiction. And at the end you are left with that sensation of WTF did I just watch.You should probably watch this once, it's definitely an experience."
tanniemannie,"Apr 7, 2022",8/10,"For me it was too much, i couldn't handle it. The film is exceptionally well made on the front of storytelling and visualizing the horrible feeling and mindset of an addiction.

Mvandermeulle32096,"Aug 20, 2022",7/10,"This movie was made, maybe, a little too well. A masterfully told, pitiful story of people going down rabbit-holes of their own making. All in all, it's a very sad tale. Through separate experiences of addiction run amok, this movie ends with a crescendo of mind-racing, heart-popping intensity. I spent the vast majority of this movie seated on my preferred end of the couch and ended it pacing back and forth, clutching my chest, trying and failing to not watch the screen. I highly recommend it, but I think the single viewing is enough for me in this lifetime."

I am not going to get into any plot detail, but the movie is so strong that even though I hate the way it makes me think and feel, I seem to watch it over and over again. The movie portrays probably one of the worst situations a person can be in when it comes to drugs. It is a true ""horror"" story for anyone taking any kinds of drugs, legal, illegal, prescription, or over the counter. Ths movie is a huge eye opener. I recommend this movie to everyone, however watch it during hte day and not in the middle of the night as I seem to do, for it probably will give you nightmares."

estebangonzalez10,"Sep 16, 2010",7/10,"This cult film got recognized and reached mainstream success thanks to great performances from Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly. It is a very controversial movie which deals with drug addiction in a very crude and realistic manner. The director was not afraid of tackling the issue of drug addiction and presenting it in a raw manner. The different kinds of addictions are addressed as you have a lot of sniffing, injecting, and coke dealing on the one hand, and medical prescript weight pills on the other hand so the different kind of addictions are addressed here and yes the medical drug pills are considered as equally addictive and harmful as the rest. At the end they both can have devastating results and the director tackles these issues. The film is very original and has several interesting filming sequences which just add to the overall mood of the movie giving it a more realistic and crude vision as do the dream sequences and hallucinations. At first it might seem as the movie is going nowhere if not paid attention too but at the end every sequence adds up to the mood of the film creating a crude and real film sending out a mirror message of the effects that drug addiction has. The movie succeeds in that the viewer experiences the hallucinations and the effects of the drugs and it pulls us in to a world many of us perhaps never have experienced."
bigv82,"Jun 23, 2002",1/10,"I rented this movie yesterday based on the resounding and overwhelming appreciation it received from IMDB voters. I have to say that it did not live up to its billing. Everyone who commented on the movie has said it is ""powerful"" and ""unique"". I feel that the movie was very ""obvious"". The movie continually tried to showcase the dangers of drugs and abuse of drugs. They do not do this successfully however, because they go to these incredibly stupid extremes that are so overdone and unnecessary that it became disgusting to watch and no longer plausible or even believable. Anyone that truly liked this movie based on its content has serious problems. I knew exactly what was going to happen before it did. People who have drug addictions may  go to great lengths to obtain the drugs but COME ON! The people in the film start acting like they are possessed by the devil himself and the end result of their drug addiction is the worst possible situation. I mean the WORST possible situation. The movie is not accurate nor is it appropriate. Stupid really. Thats all from Big V. 3/10."
hashishtripathi-76937,"Nov 14, 2018",9/10,"It takes a considerable degree of cinematic madness to venture to make a movie like Requiem for a Dream. The reckless psychological thriller by Darren Aronofsky stands tall and bold in its title of the 9th most disturbing movie of all time according to esteemed sources. Only having been the director of Pi before Requiem, it seems to have been a leap for Aronofsky to take up a project about dark subjects like those the movie reeks of.
Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) receives a crank call about having won a spot on one of the electrifying commercials and lucky draw shows she obsesses over out of fascination. Being the spick-and-span old lady she is, she unknowingly begins speed pills to lose weight and struggle into her favourite red dress. Meanwhile her son, a spoiled junkie called Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), opens a drug business with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) to help his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) set up her own boutique. The three miserable youngsters and Sara slip into grave miseries and ricochet into the darkest mirage of their dreams in a requiem that plays its purpose effectively.
There is not one performance in the movie that fails to compete with the other three. Leto and Connelly are perfectly successful in their chemistry and tragedy. Burstyn takes up a terrific makeover since her The Exorcist role years ago and her performance never lets you get comfortable in your seat.
Aronofsky and his hip-hop montage are amusing portrayals of the movie's disturbing theme. The exactitude of the pressure created by Hubert Selby Jr (also the author of the novel of that inspired the film) and Aronofsky's screenplay and Clint Mansell's music and Matthew Libatique's cinematography are what keep you interested enough till the movie takes a deep dark drift. A drift which will make every conversation about drug films excluding Requiem for a Dream incomplete.
Here is a movie so unabashed, so heavy, I say it should be a lesson to all those teenagers looking to experiment. Because it explores the dark side of the dark world. Because it tells you how you face the music after the fun. How letting lose into an addiction can cost you your freedom, body, mind and soul."
damianphelps,"Dec 11, 2020",9/10,"This movie does what I wish more movies would do (I guess its not easy), it just keeps getting better the longer it goes.An incredible piece of film making that refuses to trivialise or step away from the story they are telling.
The story itself does not move to far however the characters take quite the journey.
They take this journey via some of the best acting I have ever seen particularly Burstyn who is staggeringly good in this.One for the ages"

shawnmikedryer,"Jan 20, 2022",10/10,"Requiem for a dream hits you like a shock to the system but ever so slowly & definitely surely. It effectively shows the true sequence of events that hard drug addiction almost always brings & director Darren Aronofsky displays these pitfalls in the most sickening but truthful way, not one punch is pulled. The score is equally chilling & pairs beautifully with some truly breathtaking cinematography thats delivered in a transformative way. The acting here is exceptional & you can really feel the weight of anxiety from the entire situation, the last 30 minutes are absolutely gut-wrenching."

See how their lives are concurrently same but different.
What makes this movie fantastic is the directors use of fast moving shots, camera angles and first person pieces to camera that just immerse you in their lives and the now.
With a haunting soundtrack it is a classic piece of cinematography.
Give it a watch but be prepared to be shocked."
rortlieb,"Jul 25, 2001",N/A,"Requiem For A Dream is the only film that I have ever seen that has actually pained me to see.  It's not that the acts that these young people are put through, its that they are so human.  This film truly transfers the pain of the characters on the screen to the people in the audience.Jennifer Connelly gives a stunning performance.  I have never seen her go through such a transfermation of character as she did in Requiem.  She is truly fit for the role, and she should be given her due kudos.  Not to slight any of the other actors in the film.  Marlon Wayons and Josh Leto give great performances as well and the women that plays Leto's mother in the film is stunning.  She truly goes insane.I would say that Requiem is definitly not for the weak at heart or those with a weak stomach.  It is though one of the most captivating films that I have seen, and it is not to be forgotten."
krmflam,"Aug 6, 2025",7/10,"The film tackles a socially relevant theme with striking intensity. What makes it stand out are several key elements: a powerful soundtrack that drives the emotion, outstanding performances from the cast, and a clever use of fast, repetitive sequencing that gives the narrative a unique and impactful rhythm. Together, these aspects create a distinctive cinematic experience. By combining thematic relevance, artistic quality, and visual innovation, the film achieves what defines a successful work. It fully deserves its recognition in the world of cinema.Rating: 7/10."
stupid_llama,"Aug 8, 2025",7/10,"Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that feels like getting punched in the gut for two hours. Darren Aronofsky doesn't hold back, and the intensity never really lets up. The way it's shot, cut, and scored makes everything feel urgent and claustrophobic, like you're trapped right there with the characters.The performances are raw across the board, with Ellen Burstyn delivering something genuinely heartbreaking. The film's visual style is relentless, using repetition and extreme close-ups to drill the desperation into you. It's not an easy watch, and it's not trying to be - it's a slow collapse, scene after scene.I wouldn't call it a movie I'd revisit often, but it's one worth seeing at least once for the sheer craft and emotional weight. It's a sharp, unforgiving portrait of addiction and the systems that let people rot. When the credits roll, you're left sitting in silence, which feels like exactly what it was going for."
preg4810,"Sep 30, 2003",5/10,"I know I'm in the minority on this, but I found this movie to be more hype than content. This to me, is a classic example that just because a movie ultra-realistically depicts the ups and downs of addiction, doesn't make it good. The acting is fantastic, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, who in my opinion gives the best performance of his young career, but at times, especially the end, this movie seems to get morbid just for shock value. I find myself not rooting for the character, but just waiting for it to end. While it realistically shows the lives of four people, all reaching out for their dreams, there is really no hope that they'll succeed, they all seems doomed to failure from the beginning, and redemption seems to be nowhere in sight."
Lain666,"Jun 25, 2020",9/10,"Requiem for a Dream is about a man, with his two friends and his mother. It shows that drugs are very bad.It is made in 2000. It is a Drama/Psychological thriller. It runs for 1h 50m. It stars Jared Leto.The plot of the movie is fluid and the things that happen in the movie are regularly sudden. The scene where the main character and his friends take drugs is regularly repeated and is a very visually appealing scene. It has 3 separate stories about the main characters mother, him and his best friend and his girlfriend.The acting in the movie is great. The main characters are talented and make the movie more depressing. You can see the despair in the movie, and there is a lot of it.I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a depressing film with drugs in it."
gogoschka-1,"Jul 22, 2019",9/10,"I had already seen - and loved - Aronofsky's debut film PI (1998), and so I went into this with high expectations. The film managed to exceed them by far; it's a masterpiece that manages that rare feat where the impact of the dead serious subject matter (substance abuse) is enhanced, not subverted, by the director's choice to offer a truly cinematic, stylish and visually exciting experience. A sad, beautiful work of art that features a career-best performance by Ellen Burstyn; an uncompromising - and often shockingly graphic - depiction of a downwards spiral that leaves no viewer unaffected."
killercharm,"Feb 19, 2020",9/10,"One of my favorite movies. From one of my favorite directors. Each character descends into their own kind of drug hell. It's a beautiful train wreck you can't look away from. Sara Goldfarb's joyous need to fit into her red dress is doped into a psychosis that consumes her. Marion Silver surrounds her clothes-designing talent with heroin until only heroin is left. Her descent is painted on her face as her make up becomes more garish with each scene. Tyrone C. Love loses his freedom and Harry Goldfarb loses his very arm. The gut-punch is so real - the heartbreak so well communicated. It's kind of hard to believe that this movie is so beautifully wrought, but it is."

tessagirl2,"Oct 17, 2001",N/A,"I rented this film not knowing much about it. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I was drawn into the plot and the characters. I was intrigued by some of the creative editing techniques - which provided a really amazing rhythm to the film. It helps you really feel the character's experiences.The title demonstrates that it is a serious film. (Requiem means a hymn, composition, or service for the dead.) However, many people who may not be familiar with this word's meaning might not know that the movie's title translates roughly to ""Death or Funeral of a Dream..."" It lives up to this title well. This is not a happy film. It's really quite depressing.Overall, I recommend the film, but I also strongly suggest you make sure you're in the mood for the emotional roller coaster it will take you on. This is not entertainment. It's an experience."
johnnyboyz,"Aug 26, 2011",7/10,"One of the more terrifying things about Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is how numerous extras appear to just 'exist' amidst proceedings and merely get on with their own lives, fleetingly mentioning the odd happening from recent times, as they intermingle with the film's core characters whom are witnessing their own existences fall apart at their very seams. Watching these people going about their business on screen reminds us of the same way those figures, or people, in our nightmares mingle around in the background as we dream on; we're aware of them, much like the central characters are aware of them here, but we cannot really make them out nor indeed really work out what it is they're saying or plotting. Often, we feel at the mercy of them; we pray that they're not speaking or plotting against us. Such are the situations the numerous leads, in this rather eye-opening urban drama that does carry an hallucinogenic, nightmarish quality, eventually come to bury themselves in; a sad, sorrowful film depicting the gradual falling away from reality of a number of people because of drugs or drug addiction in varying forms as well as falsified dream chasing.What is most admirable about the film is the manner in which how, the now somewhat renowned American director, Darren Aronofsky manages to take an idea one might surmise with a one-sentence pitch and manages to spin a tale out of it all that's cinematic and with a distinct, applied aesthetic which engages without ever glorifying and never at once feels like a lecture. The film revolves around a handful of disparate New York-based characters, their tales running parallel in a multi stranded fashion with their coming into contact with drugs, or the drug trade in some form, making up the meat of film's core. It is, much like 1996's Trainspotting, a smart and cunning drama applying a post-modern spin to what might constitute as what the British used to refer to as 'kitchen sink drama' in its depiction of predominantly young, attractive people destroying their lives through the lust for a drug fix. In this sense, Aronofsky has made a 'whizz-bang' film guaranteed to keep those of a younger disposition in their adult lives occupied whilst tell a tale systematically demonising the activity within, and yet retaining enough intensity for it to appeal to those well beyond the dangers of slipping into drug addiction.Jared Leto plays Harry Goldfarb, a young Brooklyn based man with a penchant for class-A drugs, which his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) additionally shares, and constantly on the look for ways into the narcotics trade operating out of this shady corner of The Big Apple. Living not so far away from Harry is his elderly mother, Sara (Burstyn); a woman living in a decrepit apartment with a flurry of other elderly women, of whom spend most of their time sitting outside in the summer's heat on the pavement, and whose lone item in her flat that's worth any money at all is her television. The things in life to which she holds dear lie in the form of one of her son's school photos, depicting the kid at better and more affluent times, and that television through which she gradually observes herself becoming the newfound star of a kind of reality TV show following a phone call from the network inviting her in.The film dances between the two strands with the sort of consummate ease that would have you think it were were a piece composed by a filmmaker seemingly nearing the height of his game; Marlon Wayans' local lowlife Tyrone Love filtering into proceedings on account of being good friends with Harry and later heading his own story of grief when things reach a hilt. Aronofsky seeps a sense of repugnance through proceedings; a 'sickness in the stomach' feeling; an aesthetic feeding off what can only really be likened to that of the drug-induced, nauseating aesthetic certain American films from the turn of the 1970s, in the form of Easy Rider or Midnight Cowboy, carried with them. There is a gross repetition to some events that unfold which, rather than frustrate the audience, has feel the clammy, grotesque sensation rife throughout. Sara's gradual obsession with weight loss pills and the necessity to essentially look as thin, and therefore ill-mindedly beautiful, as possible dominates her story; the film, as it depicts her seemingly withering away to a desired size, rears the other way in its depiction of her surroundings by gradually bulking out her apartment into this medieval chamber of filth and mould – a locale in which she looses her mind; hallucinates inanimate objects coming alive and suffers premature proleptic shifts to stardom plus the conclusion of this celebrificated process she desires.Harry is a good looking boy with a good looking girlfriend; both of whom admit they love one another very much and we sense in an alternate world, they'd be able to settle down away form all this. Their brief, gentle early embrace is a hundred-times more erotic than the depths toward which young Marion will have to later plunge for her drug 'fix'. Then there is Tyrone's path formulating out of the events, a strand more akin to being a gangster film or drugs trade thriller which might have made a fascinating short all by itself. The film, in spite of being driven by a very simple message or core thesis, is constructed around the incorrect use of lens' deliberately done so to induce sickness; excruciatingly low camera angles and cinematography encompassing good uses of extreme close ups of objects that aren't nasty to look at, but evoke reactions of disgust anyway. The film is a hardened and substantial peek into the crevasses of drug addiction merging uneasily with mental illness; a peek that is studiously executed in what is a highly effective drama."
tpv500,"Oct 22, 2000",9/10,"What a treat for folks who want some meat on their movies! You'll get sucked into the characters' worlds immediately and feel their pain-- just like you used to before pre-fab, one-size-fits-all film scripts became the norm. While the plot itself is no surprise, watching Burstyn will consume you. A spectacularly directed, photographed and edited film. Even the sound editing is something special. After you've seen the movie, check the web site, which is as different as the film itself."
SimonD1900,"Nov 30, 2019",7/10,"Very strong and impactfull movie about addiction but also loneliness in a cold world. And also a good and deep philosophycal study on the human condition. Masterfully directed and very well acted also. But it just gives a very much too sad portrayal of life in my opinion, not a ray of sunshine to be seen anywhere. It's just a bit to much. Overdramatic to say the least. Not saying that life can't be truly horrible. But come on, give me a break."
MiloMindbender,"Sep 23, 2001",1/10,"While the trailer for this movie was seductive, most notably for its MTV-style quick shots from the film & music, actually watching it was an experience in torture.  This film is one big cliche. Perhaps US raver kids (born after 1980) who have never seen a good film might find this to be ""different"" & ""unusual"", but for anyone that's seen non-US or pre-1980 films, this film is one big bore. It's presentation of drug use is no more complex or realistic than the ""This is your brain on drugs"" PSAs that graced US television sets more than a decade ago. If you're into stream-of-consciousness & lots of style in your drug film check out  ""Naked Lunch"", If you're into the drama & humor of it all then check out ""Trainspotting"", or if you need a dose of pessimism & reality then check out ""Drugstore Cowboy"". Hell, even ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" is better than this mess. The acting is awful, especially Ellen Burstyn.  I was never convinced that her over-the-top performance was anything but acting....if you really want to see a food performance from her check out ""The Last Picture Show"".   What irks me most about the film is that its MTV-style quick cuts & soundtrack really mask the fact that there is really nothing to it.   I could have spent the 90 or so minutes I wasted watching it doing something more productive...like my laundry. By far the most boring drug movie I have ever seen.  Advisory: take some caffeine or amphetamines first if you want to stay awake to the ending."
browneyes_88,"Nov 20, 2006",9/10,"I watched this movie alone and felt somewhat emotionally shattered afterward. However, it is one of the most compelling and brutal movies. It follows the lives of four drug addicted people. Sara, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian, and Harry's best friend Tyrone. Each character tries to fulfill his idea of a recipe to attain happiness. I watched helplessly on the sideline as they all spiraled into a deeper pit then I even imagined. It is so well done that I felt sick to my stomach at the end because I felt so entangled in the characters lives. The movies was quite graphic. It's very hard to put into words. Just see it if you can handle it."

moonspinner55,"Sep 17, 2006",6/10,"Anti-drug drama from director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby, Jr. was no doubt designed to make an impact on (one assumes) young people--what with reckless lovers Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly and drug buddy Marlon Wayans at the forefront--though it's Ellen Burstyn's performance as an elderly pill-popper trying to lose weight that makes the film worthwhile. One can see right away Aronofsky's attraction to this material: told from each of the four addicts' perspectives, it's one long, brutal spiral downward, climaxing in a fury of sucker-punch editing. Burstyn received the film's only Oscar nomination for her bravura portrayal of Leto's television and weight-obsessed mother from Brooklyn who slowly starts to crack apart from uppers (Leto says to her, ""I can hear you grinding your teeth from over here!""). Not a pleasant experience, but full of showmanship. Aronofsky seems to have learned from the best, pulling a Kubrick-esque barrage of tricks from his cinematic manual to create both a narcotizing and a nervy effect. The lulling, deluded daze these characters fall into isn't romanticized--it's seen as a trap; soon, they're just rats in a maze, filmed by Aronofsky through a fish-eye lens. We get insight into the sickness of drug addiction, but little sympathy--perhaps that's why the film isn't moving on a gut level (Burstyn, for instance, already lives in what looks like lower-middle class hell, and the kids have no direction right from the start). As a case study, the movie does falter due to the content of style over substance; however, as a visceral experience, it's a flamboyant triumph. **1/2 from ****"
sowma,"Aug 16, 2002",9/10,"the movie was awesome.  aronofsky explores the effects of addiction in an uncaring world.  i do not believe this is a movie about drugs per se.  the drug use, although central to the movie's theme, is only a vehicle for the message about addiction.  i think everyone can identify with this movie because we're a nation of addicts.  caffeine, nicotine, food, love, money, sex... addiction is not limited to illegal drugs.  the movie is just sort of a hypothetical exercise and takes the one theme all the way down to rock bottom. on a side note, i think all that split screen stuff is just a way to show how each character is isolated from each other by addiction- after all, isn't that what addiction does?  and how can i forget... ELLEN BURSTYN ROCKED!  definitely robbed."
mil ceulemans,"Jul 5, 2001",3/10,"first off, this movie is a bit repetitive, which is of course on par with the idea of showing people being addicted. (mother likes her chocolates a bit too much first (later on she turns to diet pills), her son and his friends are into harddrugs of various kinds) and all are constantly on the outlook for more of the same kind. the problem with movies about drug-addicts is that however alien their situation may be to a person watching it, the person still needs to feel compassion or have similar feelings towards them in order for the movie to 'succeed'. alas, no such thing here. the main characters (apart from the great acting mother) all look like the lousy but oh so trendy 'actors' you see in commercials or videoclips (there are plenty of references to both, but i can't think of a single one right now that wasn't a cliché or that wouldn't be beaten senselessly by the overall sublimeness of 'magnolia' or the freshness 'trainspotting' had at the time). so, the movie's protagonists are mostly 20+ year olds with nothing on their hands but trying to score and use drugs (and screwing even that simple given up). the characters just don't come alive for me and the obligatory postmodernistic/ nihilistic/ apocalyptic downward spiral which sets in is boring as hell to watch through even though (or just because) the whole thing is cut up much like a flashy videoclip. obviously so to hide the lack of insight on behalf of the makers (though i have to say here i absolutely loved 'Pi', aranofsky's debut which i rate very highly). the crappy finale was partly stolen from kubrick's overrated 'eyes wide shut' and it almost made me laugh because it was so unbelievably unbelievable to see the various plots develop as they did. on a more positive note, the soundtrack is great though, as was Pi's (nevertheless aphex twin would eat mansell any day of the week, kronos quartet or no, but the soundtrack is without a doubt the most intriguing facet to this otherwise one-dimensional fiasco) - go see terry gilliam's 'fear and loathing in las vegas' instead if you want a 'bad trip'. at least gilliam doesn't solely rely on clichés or gimmickry and even when he does, it always shows somehow that he doesn't take himself too seriously or that he uses the right amount of irony / cynicism, something mr aranofsky obviously has yet to master)."
VioletViolette,"Dec 31, 2018",10/10,"Firstly, I have to address comments other reviewers made about the title of this film being ""pretentious"". Do some research. This film is based on a novel titled ""Requiem for a Dream"" by Hubert Selby Jr written in 1978, before pretension was a ""thing"".Ok, now to the movie.Please only watch this if you're a patient person, if you will give it your attention, it deserves nothing less. The story is heartbreaking, yes, and the characters are mesmerising, yes, but the true hero here is the score. The music by the Kronos Quartet will sing to you in a haunting rendition of the soundtrack to your life, forever changed, once you walk away from this movie. The sounds are perfectly in tune with the visual, something that gives this movie the only 10 I have given out so far.This movie will change you. The 4 main characters, and their descent into darkness is something so incredibly special, it needs to be seen by those who will appreciate it."
peter_nilsson88,"Sep 20, 2019",8/10,"I've never used drugs in my life but this movie truly makes a great effort in showing what drugs can do to people regarding physical, psychological and behavioural aspects.I just finished watching this movie and Oh My God is it disturbing, where you really feel the torment of heavy drug addiction and how it controls the users body. What the characters do in order to get their drugs just makes you sick, sad and disturbed all at the same time.The movie is all about feelings and emotions of the viewer. With sound effects, music and surreal settings you are put in a disturbing mood from the start which also changes and escalates throughout the film - Really Brilliant way of getting the audience not just watch, but also feel the agony of the main characters. I also liked how the drug addiction starts with some ""good times"" where they enjoyed getting high, ending up with desperation and having to do literally anything to get the necessary drugs just to not shake from abstinence.This is the first performance I've seen with Marlon Wayans where he's not in a comedy and man is he good! Most actors a great, especially Ellen Burstyn.This is my first view now in 2019 and I do feel that there are some flaws. Jared Leto is good but some of his lines felt forced like the repeated phrases ""Ma!"" and ""...for Chrissakes!"" which is too bad. The style of the movie reminded me of the TV show ""24"" which is also an early 2000's work which for me feels a bit out dated. Not really the movie's fault that I saw it first in 2019 but the overall score for me is a solid 8/10 with a high recommendation to see it."

Oz M Andias,"Nov 21, 2001",N/A,"It hurts, no?  Thump. It happens again. Two hours later, you've been punched in the back of the head thirty two times. Doesn't hurt so much anymore, does it? This is the failing of Requiem For A Dream.It's an interesting concept, but looks far too clean and stylized to be taken seriously. There could've been many more ways to approach this. And personally, I feel Aronofsky should have chosen a less gimmicky one. By constantly attacking the viewer with ferocious images, Aronofsky defeats his own point. He wants to show you that what's going on is real, but the way he shows you seriously detaches you from the film after a while. He takes several camera and editing techniques that were great in Pi and runs them into the ground. This movie tries to be gritty, but the fancy camera tricks ultimately just propels the cinematic quality way over the point. Give it a try, you might like it, but I personally felt it simply tries too hard to be real and ultimately comes off as fake."
Prismark10,"Nov 6, 2016",6/10,"Requiem for a Dream is a grim, intense, choppy, trippy film about drug abuse. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a frumpy retiree who watches television all day. She wants to fit into her red dress as she believes she will appear in her favourite show and is on diet pills to lose weight.The pills are actually amphetamines and they make her hallucinate.Sara's son Harry (Jared Leto) is a drug addict, he steals from her, he is gaunt from the drugs, his arm ruined by the injections.His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is on a downward spiral. To score, to survive she will have to take part in sex parties, humiliating herself. Their best pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) realise that drug addiction has overtaken their lives and they are heading for the bottom of the barrel.Director Darren Aronofsky is fascinated by the use of the camera and sound. He uses split screens, fast cuts, speeded up editing, flashbacks to show the characters wanting their drugs, then the effect of the hit and later the withdrawal.It is an assault on the senses, it is also a provocative film but I felt that the visual tricks were disguising a thin story."
redbullrex,"Feb 1, 2021",8/10,"It's a good movie, but it's not for everyone. The reason it's not for everyone is because it's beyond accurate... the actors did a phenomenal job! Thousands of people struggle with drug addiction everyday, and if you have some sort of history with drug addiction, this movie can be overwhelming. The parent guide had severe on each catergory. In my opinion this is more accurate.Sex and Nudity - more than severe
Violence - moderate
Profanity - severe
Alc and drugs - more than severe
Intense scenes - severeEvery second of the entire movie is filled with intense music and sounds that are similar to a horrible comedown or a high filled with anxiety and/or paranoia.Sadly, a movie with many great scenes isn't always enough, this movie could have been so much more. I was able to predict everything that was going to happen, not the ""shock"" value ofc, but things like the outcome of a scene, and even the ending of the movie. The drug use is accurate, the effects and so on... but when it comes to police, doctors, treatment etc etc the movie fails miserably... up to a point where it's just annoying to watch."

mr-rwshack,"Nov 1, 2020",8/10,"Very disturbing visually as the director seeks to manifest the emotions of characters to the viewer. I appreciate this film direction, writing and acting more than years ago. It summarizes the insanity of drug use and equally foolish choices we make when we have no moral standards, self-discipline, and perseverance to make an honest living. The result is selfish-yet-self-destructive behavior that ruins the lives of others as well. What would America be like if we reset history and made drug use UNcool?"
justinbrizendine,"Aug 21, 2020",8/10,"This movie is disturbing. It is also great. The two aren't mutually exclusive as most might assume. Everyone in this world has been, or knows someone, affected by drug addiction. As we will continue to see in society, it ravages. Most cliche interpretations of this revolve around young people. Rightfully so. But Requiem's most heartbreaking narrative(imo) comes from the old woman. It truly illuminates how drug addiction affects everyone. With help from one of the most unsettling scores ever created, this movie should be seen. Like going to an HIV ward at a hospital. Or visiting a homeless shelter and speaking with people. So you know it exists. This movie is straight up hard to watch. But do it for yourself. If anything, to remind yourself how good you really have it. But also, to recognize how things can ALWAYS get worse. The only reason why I didn't rate it 10/10 is because it's so unbelievably depressing."
SpaaceMonkee,"Jan 7, 2021",9/10,"There are many reviews of this movie already, and I have not much to add. The film tends to fall into either the 9-10 or 1-2 range based on the reviewer. It's clearly controversial, though I think the high scores make a better case and aligned more closely with my experience. (Many of the low reviews chastise the movie for being apparently unfairly harsh on hard drug use, like a Hollywood version of a D.A.R.E. film, without presenting a more nuanced view of why people begin using drugs in the first place. I think that's an unfair criticism, as the film starts well after most of the characters began using, meaning those reviews are complaining about something that isn't the focus of the movie, at least with respect to most of the characters.)I believe Requiem for a Dream is one of those films that engages in a darkly captivating way where you can't look away even as you know you're watching a tragedy unfold. It's expertly done and powerful, even though it's certainly not a ""fun"" time, much as you might not ""enjoy"" movies like Schindler's List or American History X, though most people readily would recommend them as required viewing. Requiem for a Dream falls into the same category of masterful films that leave a mark on you long after the credits roll."
ottorodriguezcastillo,"Aug 15, 2020",9/10,"A very dystopian film about the uses of drugs and how utopian dreams can end up in the dystopia.Darren Aronofsky continues doing movies with strong messages and using the Icarus myth majestically. Showing how the ambition that exceeds limits can sometimes destroy us.We see an amazing performance by all the actors and actresses, especially Ellen Burstyn who takes the madness to a next level. Also, we see one of the films with the best cinematographic edition seeing an amazing work upon cuts and the montage. And in last place but not less important, we should also highlight the score of the movie which disturbs even more than the film itself."
allisonnack,"Dec 6, 2000",N/A,"Requiem for a Dream, the latest film from Darren Aronofsky, the acclaimed director of 1998's Pi, can be described with a word that is not often used in conjunction with today's film offerings - that is, groundbreaking.Aronofsky, a meticulous director, uses distinctively innovative techniques to set the tone and convey the themes within this dark, beautiful, complex depiction of the nature of addiction. Aronofsky makes use of split screens, revolving cameras, extreme close-up, distorted angles, blasting sound, and repetitive symbols, all in an effort to convey the actual experience of the substance user under the influence. The film is a visceral experience, unrelenting in its portrayal of each character's descent into their own personal abyss.The film focuses on three main characters: the Jewish mother from Brooklyn, Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, the son, Harry, played by Jared Leto, and the girlfriend, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. Mom is addicted first to television, and as a result of a proposed appearance on her favorite show, decides to lose weight with the aid of diet drugs, prescribed by an unethical physician. Harry and Marion are fond of heroin, but they will settle for something amphetamine in a pinch. All three start out as casual users, but as they persist with their addictions, each character's environment deteriorates and they all sink deeper into unreality. Aronofsky portrays this by having the characters interact with each other in a relatively normal way at first, focusing on the familial relationship between mother and son, and the romantic one between Harry and Marion.The early scenes are brightly lit and pleasant to watch, with many shots of the gorgeous Leto and Connelly lying head-to-head, looking remarkably alike, awash in drugs and love. Even the screen-wide use of the symbols and sounds of drug use seem exhilarating and exciting at first, and it is not until the viewer is bombarded with them relentlessly that they become uncomfortable to watch and hear. Aronofsky splits the film into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter.  The seasons change along with the characters, and as time progresses, the characters split from each other, each advancing more deeply into their own addiction and despair. Their individual descents parallel each other, which Aronofsky represents by quick cutting from one character's current predicament to the others, all the scenes infused with garish colors, murky lighting, and disquieting music. At one point Aronofsky unites the characters by showing the visual similarities between the bloodshot, bruised, and terrified eyes of the mother, the heavily made-up, smeared and bleary eyes of Marion, and the infected, bloody and blackened wound that Harry grows on his inner arm.The performances in this film are very strong, especially from Ellen Burstyn, as a perfectly realized suburban junkie. Her character is really the sympathetic one, caught not in a desire to get high, but just to be a little more attractive. Her plight is the most saddening. Also notable in his role is Marlon Wayans, playing against type in a non-comedic role as Harry's drug buddy.In a conventional drug film, the addict usually dies, as a morality play, or to accomplish some finality for the storyline. Aronofsky refuses to go for the easy way out. The last twenty minutes of this film possess some of the most harrowing footage I have ever seen, and there is no respite for the viewer or the characters."
kelpe1925,"Nov 16, 2023",6/10,"I went my whole life without watching this movie. 38 years later, after watching countless movies I expected big things from this... the movie that everybody raves about. Stellar cast... interesting concept... it's got to be great, right? MehHonestly, for only a little less than an hour and fifty minutes, it was up until the last 20 that I was thinking... this has to be more than just a junkie movie. I understand that the music score, the cinematography, the actors should all make a difference in a movie... I was just kinda bored... up until the last 20 minutes. That being said, even the last 20 minutes aren't worth a 7 rating, let alone 8+.Honestly, with all the great actors, it was Ellen Burstyn that stole the show. She's the only reason I would even rate it a 6 overall."
nbfcblog,"Oct 1, 2017",9/10,"While watching Aronofsky's uncompromisingly bleak journey into the downward spiral of four individuals living in Brooklyn, I couldn't help but think of the famous Nine Inch Nails tune Hurt.The lines, ""The needle tears a hole, The old familiar sting, Try to kill it all away, But I remember everything"", bring to mind Harry's (Leto), one of our protagonists, heroin addiction.In a way both Hurt and Requiem for a Dream (RFAD) deal with similar themes regarding individuals engaging in self-harming activities (in this case, drug use) as a means to escape their empty lives.This isn't to imply that RFAD is just a simple anti-drug PSA because while the four main characters such as the aforementioned Harry, his grandmother Sara (Burnstyn), his girlfriend (Marion) and his friend Tyrone (Wayans) are each addicted to different types of drugs; what truly drives their actions are their obsession with achieving the idealistic American Dream in order to find happiness.RFAD MWWith Sara it's being on TV, with Harry and Sara it's starting their own clothing store, and with Tyrone it's the simple desire to be loved by someone like his mother did when he was a child. Protagonists with obsessions that eventually lead to their downfall is a common theme in Aronofsky's filmography whether it's clinging on to their 80's glory days (The Westler) or perfecting ballet dancing (Black Swan) and RFAD is no exception.Aronofsky has also never been afraid to get weird. Much like David Lynch, Aronofsky uses surrealism and unorthodox film-making techniques as a tool to help externalize the emotions and state of minds of the characters.This is on display with the film's then revolutionary ""hip hop montage"" technique (previously used by Aronofsky in Pi) in which a large number of rapid short cuts are used to illustrate the character's transition from sobriety to intoxication.While there are plenty of crazy camera techniques and visual elements utilized throughout the movie such as body cams shots (Ex. Tyrone running away from a gang hit) and rapid visual distortion to showcase the characters suffering from withdrawal, by far one of my favorite moments is a quiet moment that features Harry and Sara talking face-to-face while lying in bed together.Instead of being in the same shot, both of their faces separated by a split-screen format. Despite saying they love each other, the cold dialogue delivery and the separation by the editing serves to illuminate the hallow-ness of their relationship. Harry and Sara are more in love with the idea of each other if anything else.There are many other tricks being used in order to immerse the audience into the subjective emotions of the characters, none more so than with Sara who as the film progresses experiences more vivid delusions of being on a potentially non-existent game show in addition to increased stress from trying to lose weight. Let's just say you will probably never be more scared by a refrigerator than when watching RFAD.Speaking of Sara, it would be a crime to discuss RFAD without mentioning Burnstyn's magnetic transformative performance. This isn't to minimize everybody else because the acting quality in general is great, heck, even Marlon Wayans (playing against type in his only dramatic role so far) more than holds his own against the likes of Connelly and Leto. If there was any weak link in the cast (if any because once again, everybody is awesome) it would be Leto due to his uneven New York accent in the first half of the film. Despite all the characters having less than admirable qualities, the acting gives each of them a level of believability that works in conjunction with the guerilla-style cinematography to lend an air of authenticity to RFAD.RFAD SaraHowever, seeing Burnstyn going through her transformation from absent-minded white- haired grandmother to a pill-popping anorexic red-haired wreck is both horrifying and an awe-inspiring testament to having dedication to one's craft. Out of all the characters, Sara is the one I had the most sympathy for since she was the most innocent out of anybody. She sincerely cares for her son Harry and wants nothing more than for him to be happy. This is what makes her ""nothing is left for me"" speech to Harry simply heartbreaking. Burnstyn gives some of the best acting I've ever seen because the sadness in her delivery and expressions was so moving that even cinematographer Matthew Libatique broke into tears while shooting the scene.Needless to say, RFAD is far from an uplifting film and is easily up there with Grave of the Fireflies as being one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but it's also a great Greek tragedy-style psychological character study that isn't afraid to show the ugly side of humanity."
Boba_Fett1138,"Aug 19, 2004",7/10,"This movie promised to be a lot but overall it only disappointed me. This movie promised to be emotional, shocking, confronting, nightmare giving...the greatest anti-drugs movie ever made! It wasn't any of it.There are several problems I had with this movie. The first and biggest was the style. Now, I love Tim Burton movies and I'm a Brian De Palma fan, so normally I like unusual and unique styles, however the visual style of ""Requiem for a Dream"" just didn't do it for me. In my opinion it also didn't do any good to the movie and the story. It made some of the emotional scene's even almost look comical like. I know the style was meant to give the movie a 'trippy' kind of feeling but if you truly want to have a 'trippy' movie experience watch ""Natural Born Killers"" instead.I don't know but the movie also gave me the feeling that the cast and crew didn't really did much if any research on drugs and the effects. They could have had at least spoke to some (ex)-junkies or spend 10 minutes in a room with Courtney Love or sit down all together in an Amsterdam coffeeshop for a day. I don't really know why but the movie didn't gave me the feeling at all that they did any of this. Maybe if they had done this they also wouldn't have had miss cast Jennifer Connelly. I like her as an actress but she is far to pretty and 'normal' like to play a convincing drugs addict.The story was also quite standard and pretty far fetched. I mean, if you're a drugs user this is about the extreme that could happen (but not the worst). I Only really liked the Ellen Burstyn story line. Mainly because Ellen Burstyn self acts wonderful and her character is the only one that doesn't start as an addict and is the most believable and emotionally involving one.That brings me to another I had with the movie. I couldn't feel for the characters.I make it sound like this is an horrible movie which I totally hate. But however this is not the case. There are enough positive things to say about this movie. Such as the hectic ending, that really made up a lot for me and nice little musical score by Clint Mansell was also good. I still have respect for this movie and what it tries to be but for me it overall left simply just a disappointing impression.A bad movie? No! Over-hyped? Yes!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
UNRO,"Dec 8, 2005",1/10,"I'll never understand why people are so quick to defend dull and boring movies.I know some like ""art"" movies and this is perfectly normal and acceptable, but to claim that people are ""dumb"" because they find a film dull is snobbish.I'll admit, I knew nothing of this movie when I rented it, so had no expectations or pre-conceptions and yet found myself bored to tears, and my companion was worse. It really is that bad.Some will cry that is movie is a powerful telling of the slow decent into hell that drugs bring, fair enough, but that doesn't make it interesting or good.I mean, there's artistic merit in a movie about paint drying and I'm sure if such a film was released (if not done so already) there would be people on here saying how powerful and beautiful it was and those who disagree are only interested in explosions and flipping cars etc.Truth is, rubbish is rubbish, whether it's peddled as ""action"", ""drama"", or ""art"".Whatever this movie was to you, to me it was hours of my life I won't get back. Dull, boring, pointless.Ah, yes you say, that's the point, cause drugs,,,,, blah blah blah. You can show the loneliness of a sentry guard by having 3 hours of a guy sitting in a shed looking out, pointless, dull, boring, but is it art? Who cares!"
soldiermatic,"Nov 2, 2006",8/10,"A very good movie about three friends and one of their lonely mothers and how drugs, addiction and obsession ruined their dreams of having a good life. The three friends were hoping to make it out of their poor lives by selling drugs and making enough money to move out of their very poor neighborhood. The lonely lady hod no one in her life and developed an obsession for being on television. She was too overweight to be on the television show, so she adopted a detrimental diet regime. The acting, plot and characters were very well played. The message is very strong, and the movie was overall very touching. A excellent portrayal of the consequences of drug addictions and obsession. The theme song well correlated with the ""depressing"" theme of the movie."
zurdulla,"May 9, 2020",8/10,Deep and saturated movie.The film shows how the pursuit of an easy and quick dream can ruin a life.The main minus is the bad disclosure of the personages.
muamba_eats_toast,"Apr 9, 2020",10/10,One of the darkest films I've ever seen at time it was hard to watch and look at the screen extremely powerful film and the way it's shot and the soundtrack was just perfect. If you want to be cheered up however do not watch this!
b_havag,"Jan 29, 2009",9/10,"Requiem for a Dream is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen. Everything just fits here, the road to h*ll for each character just couldn't be portrayed any better. Visuals, acting, plot, message, pace...everything just hit me like a full-speeding freight train! Brutal!It is a horrible, devastating, gruesome to watch. And that's exactly how it should be, cause that's how drugs are! Drugs WILL kill you, and they'll do it slowly, painful and messy. First they'll destroy your brain, then your body and just slowly drag all life out of you. Drugs are most definitely one of the most horrific things on this earth. And still, I couldn't keep my eyes from it. I just had to follow Harry, Sarah, Marion and Tyrones destroyals of themselves, to know the end. It was a very special feeling to be both repulsed and fascinated at the same time.Another thing that fits 110% is the soundtrack. Wow! It's a fabulous score in itself, it's somewhat beautiful, scary, horrible, sad and addictive all at once, just like the picture is.Requiem for a Dream is perfect. Personally, I think this H*LLRIDE should be shown to every 13-year old on the globe. If that wouldn't drastically cut down the number of addicts I'd be surprised. Thank you Darren Aronofsky, thank you every person involved for giving us such an extraordinary powerful anti-drug movie! 10/10"
cygatfuds,"Nov 11, 2020",9/10,"Very progressive. Aronofsky is a genius. That cutscenes, that camera angles. Oh my god! This is a 110 minute trip. Lux Aeterna is very intense too!

andrewroy-04316,"Nov 8, 2020",9/10,"Requiem for a Dream is the first movie I've ever watched that truly felt like it took a toll on me - that it was truly a hard watch. It is a sad movie, and one that is heavily stylized, which normally I dislike. Here, I think the style amplifies the substance of the film, as Aronofsky uses aggressive editing, warped perspectives, and a propulsive score to highlight the way addiction and desperation accelerate for all the characters throughout the film. This is a narrowly focused film with a clear idea and direction. Each of the four main characters feels they have to get ahead, each for their own reasons, and in their desperation they turn to things they don't truly understand. In this case, drugs are what end up bringing them down, but the film is focused on a much broader idea of consumerism and the constant pressure people feel to be succeeding, to mean something. Harry didn't have to be so aggressive in securing drug suppliers, but he pushed and put them all at jeopardy and coped by becoming addicted. Ellen Burstyn is exceptional as the lead, especially in her monologue about how she feels she has nothing to live for and is yearning for her younger days when she felt a sense of purpose. When she gets a glimmer of hope, that she could be on TV and wear the red dress of her youth, she turns to pills she doesn't understand. The story is nothing remarkable, but it is an unflinching look at people falling deep into a rabbit hole, looking for a quick solution to get them out of it, and falling even deeper. What makes Requiem an exceptional movie is its technical elements. Requiem is a showcase of the power of cinema. The score is fantastic and has a manic energy balancing the hope and desperation the characters feel. The directing and editing is brilliant in showing how the four characters each have their own unique troubles and reasons, but all fall prey to the same general problem. We've seen spirals into drug addiction and losing control before, but it's well done in showing what each character is dreaming of and how they fall, and I haven't seen such a stylistically apt rendering of the phenomenon. Hats off to Aronofsky, because the technical elements accentuate the film's themes perfectly."
brendonstammer06,"Jul 21, 2022",10/10,I feel sick about watching this movie. I was sick to my stomach. Part of me hated this movie even though I loved it because of it and the performances at hand. It's complicated but here's another 10/10 Darren Aronofsky.GO TO HELL!(Black Swan: 10/10 and Mother!: 10/10)
linkedin-12192,"Nov 14, 2020",8/10,This is an intense and at times conflicted movie that demands that you attend to the issues surrounding drug abuse whilst forcing the doctrine of the continuum on you. There is certainly an aesthetic element to this that is nonetheless heart renching. Be advised that you are in Dancer in the Dark terroritory!
danielmanson,"Feb 9, 2021",8/10,"Well well well, I didn't expect that. Like most who probably haven't seen this film yet, I had been put off by the many people that have said it boggles the mind too much etc.And in all honesty I don't think it's too bad. Sure there's some weird hallucinations and so on. But if you watch the film for its face value, it's not a hard plot to grasp. I'll jump to the positives for this movie. The acting was just brilliant, really sold it to me that they were addicts. The plot itself I thought was so good, the deterioration of these 4 characters as they dealt with addiction was honestly something I couldn't take my eyes off. I was had my eyes peeled waiting for the next thing to happen. It's honestly just a really good filmIt's incredibly hard hitting I have to say though. Its something that seriously resonates with you afterwards (can be a good thing or bad depending how you feel). It's not a film you could just half-arse, it needs your full attention.Overall though it's a film that definitely needs to be watched! I enjoyed it."
baywoodarborist,"Aug 6, 2020",9/10,This film takes you to the euphoric highs of heroin to the degradation of its usage. From the music to the acting to the cinematography it's excellent. Nice round characters to destroy.
JoachimB-0,"Oct 30, 2025",10/10,"No other film has been so truly paralyzing to the extent one does start to question surrounding reality, inner self and whether decisions we make about our own life are appropriate or we just waste it all with bad choices. This movie shows brilliantly that life is a virtue on it's own. Even though we try to make best decisions, for it to go 'all right', sometimes we just can't escape the inevitable. This movie is weirdly, deeply personal in a captivating way. It may seem at first one has nothing in common with portrayed characters, but their psychological struggles seem so real and evident that you sympathize and connect with them on a deep personal level. This movie is not only about fictional characters. It's most about life of the watcher. One should bring elevated reflection out of the movie, to such an extent that sleep is impossible from endless pondering."

preppy-3,"Nov 15, 2000",8/10,"A chronicle of four people (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connolly and Ellen Burstyn) and their drug addictions and what it does to their lives. Starts off OK but becomes darker and more disturbing as it goes along. It ends with a montage showing what happens to all four of them--this sequence contains some of the most harrowing imagery I've ever seen in a film. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever see it again--it's that graphic! Still, see the film. Leto is OK; Wayans is (surprisingly) pretty good; Connolly is excellent--I've never liked her until now; and Burstyn is simply superb--a sure Oscar winner if I ever saw one. Well, worth seeing but very disturbing. Unfortunately, this film has an NC-17 rating. That's too bad--it should have an R rating so high school kids could see it. This would turn them off drugs for good!"
Lofwer,"Nov 30, 2000",1/10,"Requiem for a Dream is a movie that has its heart in the right place, but not much else.  Much has been made of the technical aspects of this film. And some of the technique does impress.  The rampant use of split screen very effectively, quickly, and cleverly underscores the selfishness of characters.  They are literally separated from one another within the film frame.  The repetition of certain elements--the rapid fire images that accompany every hit of heroin taken by the characters--is cool.  Less cool are these crazy point of view shots, lots of odd angles.  Why are they there?  They do not enhance the film in any way.  They are as pretentious and unnecessary as any technical thing in film this year.The other thing about this movie is that I didn't care about most of it. Jared Leto Marlon Wayans and the girlfriend--sorry, can't remember her name--go through all these horrible things.  And we're supposed to sympathize, feel their pain.  Oh, look what drugs have done to those poor creatures.  But look:  these people are junkies and dealers, spoiled brats doing their own thing and paying the price.  As callous as it may seem to say this, they deserve what they get.  But look, here's the other thing. Aronofsky is so heavy handed and obvious about one fact--that these characters WILL BE PUNISHED--that it becomes almost laughable.  I mean, these are cliches that even most hacks would steer clear of.  Simplistic, naive, are the words I would use to describe Mr. Aronofsky's take on this whole thing.He goes so far over the top--and he does this in the other main storyline, involving Ellen Burstyn--that he undercuts the potential power of his own piece.  It becomes a movie of bombast, a trite piece of audience manipulation.  Look at what drugs have done to this person and that person. I love that Aronofsky tried to make a really powerful anti-drug movie. But I hate how incredibly he failed."

The acting is flawless and the plot is hard-nosed and to the point. It doesn't mess around with any aspect of its sincerity. This movie is utterly chilling. There is great re-watching value here as well. Let me just say I believe this movie should be shown in High schools across the nation freshman year, unedited in it's entirety.

I ended up calling up my parents and some buddies and admitting I had a serious drug problem, thanks to this movie. Since then I've gone clean, and my life has been improving more and more. I think it takes a terribly powerful and amazing movie to bring somebody to this point. I recommend this movie to everybody, and think that movies like this would help people to stay off drugs more than all those anti-drug campaigns you get to see all the time."
=G=,"May 23, 2001",6/10,"""Requiem..."" tells of the downward spiral of several lives into a drug induced oblivion. A much over-rated non-story which won no major awards, this extrapolation of the ""Pi"" mentality treads more in the the artsy-fartsy fringe than the mainstream offering an excellent performance by Burstyn, over done artistic effects, and little else. There are many better ""druggie"" flicks with real stories to tell which don't make the viewer feel like a lookie-loo at a traffic accident.Because of it's overwrought creativity, which is more of a liability than an asset, ""Requiem..."" is the critic's darling. However, it is too far from the mainstream to be a popular which probably accounts for the small space occupied on Blockbuster's shelves by the new release. Blockbuster -does- know their market. As for the high marks given by IMDB.com users, one can only speculate. However, there's no way this flick could possibly score an 8.7 of 10 (at this writing) given voting by a demographically typical cross-section of the population. Over half the votes a max score of 10....I don't think so.Recommended for those into art for art's sake films and younger adults who haven't seen this kind of kaleidoscopic visual creativity before."

matt_in_da_net,"Jun 21, 2010",6/10,"Shallow, narrow minded, opinionated and a overall heavy-handed opinion on drugs. Aronosfsky's 'Requiem for a dream' manages to holds our attention with interesting and unique cinematography which is used to paint a subjective experiences of several drug-addicted/influences characters. Unfortunately, this is done in such a extreme anti-drug sentiment that it leans more towards some sort of anti-drug propaganda than true, insightful art.Empty of sub-text and any sort of thought-provocation, Aronosfsky holds our hand through this highly implied story and suggests that if we touch a drug, we could end up having our arms amputated, or working as a prostitute for cash. Was this Aronosfsky's intention? I cannot say - but this is what seemed to be implied in the film. If he had high ambitions for the films overall impact, it certainty fell short. I found this film like Riefenstahl's Nazi-propaganda piece ""Triumph of the will"", great cinematography, masterfully crafted - but it's overall message highly disagreeable.This could have been a great film if the story was handled more carefully without these disgustingly over-the-top vilification of drugs. It's true that drug's lead to bad places. But while i am not the seasoned drug taker, i certainly know that mama's fat-loss pill's will not to lead to a torturous brain lobotomy!"
mpaul-3,"Nov 27, 2000",2/10,"This movie is so derivative it is disgusting! I am very surprised at the number of people who think this movie is shocking and original when it is clearly stale leftovers with some fancy photography (the only redeeming quality).  The characters act like they are in some never ending music video gone terribly wrong - it was obvious that they were shallow attempts to try and make us squirm. In the end everything was so over the top and stylized it just turns out to be ridiculous, staged, and boring. If you want to go see a movie that is imaginative and breaks through the normal movie nonsense go see Dancer in the Dark!!"
justin680,"Aug 7, 2002",N/A,"I was simply amazed when I first watched this film, reading a few other comments theres a few negative points about the realism of addiction, although I can see where your coming from....what would be left of the story if the main character sat in a corner shaking. I feel Aronofsky has made a masterpiece, a new member of my top10."
RiverCollins,"Apr 11, 2007",10/10,"Beautiful, artistic, haunting movie about 4 people whose lives and relationships are destroyed bye their drug addictions. There's so much to think about and so much symbology. Not recommended for people who like to have movies ""spoon-fed"" to them. Certainly recommended for people who like more from a movie than just a few laughs or a few scares. Certainly not the sort of movie you forget about.The editing is absolutely beautiful. And note the position each character is lying in for each of their last scenes. I'd love to talk more about the symbology but I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet.Excellently acted. Jared Leto is WAY under-rated. Most likely because he's always linked to some no-talent in Hollywood (eg. Lindsay Lohan).Marlon Wayans also showed that he's a terrific actor. It's a shame he doesn't do more movies like this, because he certainly proved to be a very versatile actor. A few more serious movies and the man would've had an Oscar under his belt by now."
DonFishies,"May 15, 2006",10/10,"Requiem for a Dream was almost six years old before I had a chance to watch it beginning to end. I had seen a few scenes from it on television before, but I'd never seen the entirety until a few days ago. What I thought would just be a standard ""good film"", has turned out to be a merciless, haunting masterpiece, that leaves the viewer changed forever after viewing it.The film is a parallel story. It jumps between Harry's (Jared Leto) story about trying to score enough heroin with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to live out happy lives, and his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) story about her desperate attempts to get onto television. The film chronicles these four individuals, and their ups and downs through the course of three seasons of a year.I have nothing but praise for this compelling and thought provoking film. It may be about junkies, but I'd be lying if I, who has never done hard drugs, said I could not relate to any of the characters. Each is played to perfection by their actor. Wayans performance is a total departure from his usual comedic roles, and is only a joy to watch some real acting chops being showcased by the young actor. Leto continues to impress me, and continues to prove why he'll be a heavy hitter in years to come. Connelly is excellent as always, shining through in a role that came just before her Oscar winning role in A Beautiful Mind. Burstyn is absolutely fabulous in her role, and clearly overshadows everything that won Julia Roberts her Oscar that year. Every supporting character, from Christopher McDonald's turn as infomercial king Tappy Tibbons to Keith David as the twisted Big Tim, to all the even lesser supporting characters, all are put to screen excellently and only complement the main actors.The writing is an absolute marvel. I cannot even begin to imagine what some of the sequences look like in Selby Jr.'s novel, but I can only come to think of them either being nowhere near as good as those created by Selby Jr and Aronofsky during the creation of the film. Watching some of the features on the DVD only helps to make the viewer feel more aware of all the planning and implementation that went into creating these gorgeous and appealing shots from the film. This is a Generation X film through and through, and the way it has been created only helps to make it more of a marvel six years later.But while the performances are all excellent, it's the style of the film that makes it absolutely unforgettable. Shots are all over the place. From crazy tracking shots, to shots of both characters view points, to the absolutely insane cuts all over the film, it all makes for a fantastic visual pleasure for the eyes. There are a few grainy scenes, but they only make the authenticity of other scenes become that much better. The cinematography and art direction are just astounding. Every piece of digital and normal camera work put into the film is put to the test here, and works magnificently in the final product. Not once does the editing falter, and not once do any of the visual elements not work. They all have been meticulously created to look and feel real, and they work as a result.This is just one of those films you cannot forget, and cannot keep your eyes off of after it starts. It is brilliant in every sense of the word, and deserved more praise than it ever got. The fact that it was nominated and lost its one Best Actress nomination is an absolute travesty. It is a visual treasure, and a true thought provoker. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end, and just cannot believe I waited so long to see it.Don't make the same mistake I did. See it now, before the opportunity evades you.10/10."
Kashmir384,"Apr 1, 2008",9/10,"There are a lot of great movies out there that make you think, this one stands out above all the rest. Friends have told me how disturbed they were after watching this and being someone not normally touched by movies I had to see it. I thought it would be just another druggie falls from the top type movie but I was in for a complete shock by the presentation of the situation. If you want to be blown away by a movie you need to see this. The end completely drained me emotionally, it should easily be higher on IMDb's list. There are drug movies like Blow and Scarface(I love both) and then there is this...in a league of its own. I am yet to see a movie that i can relate it to.The acting was superb, Jared Leto was incredible and completely believable. Ellen Burstyn showed one of the most heartfelt performances I believe I have ever seen. Jennifer Connelly played what I saw as the most mediocre performance of the main characters, but was still so much deeper than most characters you see today. Finally there was Marlon Wayans...He is so talented and showcases himself perfectly in this movie. All in all, this movie had an incredible plot, the camera work fit perfectly, and the cast put forth the best overall performances I can remember. WATCH THIS MOVIE"
laxdmcm,"Oct 26, 2006",10/10,"Requiem for a Dream is not a merely a film but a jagged, unrelenting decent into the desperate world of addiction. Shrouded by denial and a longing for fulfillment, the characters in this story feed their vices and insecurities until they are consumed by them. Aronofsky fuses his creative genius (i.e. ""Hip-hop montages"") with Selbey's macabre and emotionally ravaging writing to produce a work of art that brands itself to the minds of its viewers. Augmented with a stunning soundtrack this is the complete package. Inducing empathy and sympathy for people you would usually scorn, this is a shining example of the modern anti-hero. Though at times the imagery is gruesome, this only amplifies the pervasive motif of desperation. In my opinion, it should be required viewing for all high school drug prevention programs."
echozdog,"Jul 8, 2004",10/10,"This movie really shook me up. This is why I had to give it 10/10. Any movie that gets me thinking (even if it makes me feel bad) is a good one.This movie sucks you into the lives of these four souls as they are consumed by drugs (3 heroin, 1 speed). The quick cuts of cutting drugs, shooting, blood flowing through veins, pupils dilating is very powerful. The quick cuts get faster until things spiral totally out of control.I've know my share of junkies. This movie is if anything kind to the world of heroin use. The junkie in this movie are more together than the ones I knew (note the tense).When my sons are about 14 I'll show them this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a ""just say no"" person. I'm a legalize all drugs and educate people. If we spent all the billions we spent on law enforcement on educating people we would have less junkies in this world. I have no doubt about that. This movie IS education.10/10. Made my skin crawl like the ""the Fly"" 1986 did."
Bravo419,"Sep 7, 2023",7/10,"In an age where drug abuse has become an increasing problem and ""normalized"" throughout much of society, this film's portrayal of addiction and the progressive decline it brings is a refreshing one. The lead actors, especially Burstyn, gave notable performances. I found myself often comparing her character to my own mother, and how I'd hate to ever see the latter fall into the same drug addiction spiral. I sympathized greatly with Connelly's decline, and couldn't help but resent Leto for his active role in that, while at the same time neglecting his mother throughout the film.Those are the good points. The hype for this film may have set my expectations a little too high, however. I personally didn't find it as revolutionary or disturbing as other reviewers made it out to be, with films such as ""Grave of the Fireflies (1988)"" being much more impactful in that regard. An IMDb rating of 8.3 is entering ""masterpiece"" territory... and while it has a powerful message to convey, this is no masterpiece.The constant close-up cuts of ""needle, eyeball, pill, mouth, eyeball, needle, eyeball"" etc. Were intriguing at first, but ultimately overdone. When you consider the average 100-minute film has 600 scene cuts, while this one has 2,000, you get an idea of just how overdone it is. This, along with certain special effects, didn't age well at all, making it (at times) come across as a film made in the late 1970s (and all the cheesy SFX that entails) rather than a film set in the late 1970s.While it's fascinating to watch the train wreck that is these characters' lives reach its climax in the end, the film did go a little over-the-top with certain scenes (e.g. Being violently electrocuted while awake during a simple ECT procedure), but others are much more realistic, such as one drug addict remorselessly prostituting his girlfriend for drug money and a woman being severely degraded in an adult film to feed her drug addiction. The message hits home and I'm sure many viewers can sympathize or even relate to the pain and suffering we see in these characters' lives.7/10 for a film that ended on a powerful note and is even more applicable today than it was over 20 years ago, even if certain aspects of it left something to be desired."

billcody,"Feb 12, 2002",1/10,"This is a movie made by someone who was never in the game, and written by someone who has been out of it for years.There is nothing remotely truthful about this movie. The people who think that it is - don't know the first thing about drug addiction. It does have one thing in common with a drug addict, though. It is repetitive and boring.I was really looking forward to this film. I loved PI. I just hope Aronofsky isn't a one shot wonder."
voodootyler,"Jun 23, 2001",N/A,"I first saw Requiem in a small theatre, that is dedicated to showing foreign, and great films. When I walked into Requiem I knew nothing about it, only that it was the same director as ""Pi"".  for the next 90 minutes I was locked in my seat, unable to shut my eyes, or even think about nothing except the movie. This movie turned out to be my favorite of all time. It was so powerful, and the message so clear. Honestly I believe it should be shown in every classroom, as it will scare anyone out of the drug culture. It personally frightened me out of any hard drugs. The characters are so loveable and believable that whenever something happens to them you get more and more depressed. The movie ended on such a powerful note. The artistic integrity of the movie was astounding. Filmatography was excellent, and the director couldn't have done a better job. I was physically unable to move from my seat for 10 minutes after watching it in the theatre, and then again at home... Everyone... EVERYONE should watch this. There has never before been such a real movie in my eyes. It doesn't just entertain"
insomniac_rod,"Aug 16, 2006",10/10,"One of the most influential but somehow underrated movies from the new millennium. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is not an easy watch because it displays the real horrors of drugs and it's consequences. The events of the movie perfectly show what it feels like to be under the influence of a narcotic or any kind of drug (even alcohol). Through it's running time there's a feeling of sadness, desperation, and fear. By any means the director tries to state an opinion towards the use of drugs; the movie only shows what really happens.Anyhow, watching ""Requiem..."" is like being for the first time in a roller coaster because it takes you by surprise and you really feel desperation but you can't stop watching.The acting is perfect, excellent. Ellen Burstyn's performance always manages to send me shivers. Her performance is impressive, breath taking. Jennifer Connelly also delivers a strong performance. She's always great in her roles. Her eyes have many things to say... She can display deep feelings such as desperation, happiness, sadness, and even confusion. Jared Leto surprised me as the desperate junkie who had potential to be someone in life, but he wasted it. He was very good.The direction is from other world. I mean, it's genuinely impressive. The director knows how to transfer the character's feelings to the audience. That's not easy even for a movie that is very dramatic. It also blows away the viewer with bizarre and surreal images that are supposedly caused by drugs. Really, some events in the movie truly show what someone can ""think"" or in this case, hallucinate under the effects of a drug.I can't praise this movie enough and I believe that there are minimal things to spoil. ""Requiem..."" should be watched with regular expectations in order to be 100% shocked and pleased after the ending credits. But don't watch this movie for shocking purposes; I mean, watch it as a serious piece of film making that does not tries to prove anything. The whole viewing experience is an instant impact."
ericjams,"Oct 31, 2006",9/10,"I love this movie. From the underlying theme of addiction to the social commentaries to the sheer beauty of the cinematography. But ultimately, I like movies that force you to either look away or hold on, squirm in your seat and continue absorbing the visual imagery, no matter how beautiful or disturbing. There is rarely a point in this movie when the viewer does not realize that the main characters, although battling different demons are all entering individual downward spirals. Although the uninformed may label this a ""drug"" movie, drugs are only the catalysts which propel the characters into much deeper and interesting battles with their own souls. When I hear the song that plays during the final and most harrowing shots elsewhere, it always brings me back to the imagery of this movie."
kiradykesky,"May 15, 2020",10/10,"Lonely and desperate, I can't imagine a life without TV chocolates. There is no light in the world or they are all extinguished by the darkness of despair. Addiction to desire is like being lured by the devil. Time and time again, standing on the verge of collapse. There is only one person left in the world, the dim speed of TV in front of a bed or sofa, and the pupils after hyperactivity shrink and expand, the world is so empty and psychedelic."
suneha-27490,"Jul 28, 2020",10/10,"Honestly so good. For a movie made in 2000, it is ahead of its time in terms of filmmaking."
Tobatoba,"Jun 5, 2021",10/10,"No other film makes you feel as empty as this film. The acting is superb and the cinematography is harsh and hateful, but beautiful in it's own way. The editing and sound design is on point. I can not believe that Ellen Burstyn didn't win the Oscar, and I can not believe that it was the only nomination for this film. The academy was blind and deaf that year."
emperor_bender,"Sep 12, 2008",9/10,"Not a whole lot of movies these days get you to actually think.Luckily, Requiem for a Dream is one of the few that require thinking and feeling.This movie is not for the faint of heart or feeble-minded.The movie tells the story of 4 people who have big dreams of happiness only to have them ruined by drug addictions. Sara Goldfarb, a TV-loving widow who is addicted to diet pills, her heroin-addict son Harry Goldfarb, his coke-addicted girlfriend, Marion Silver, and his drug-dealing friend, Tyrone Love.You learn a lot about each character and begin to sympathize with their situation as they begin to spiral downward with their addictions.Ellen Burstyn was excellent in The Exorcist, so I knew she would give a good performance as Sara Goldfarb. I had never seen Jared Leto in other movies, but he sure didn't disappoint here as Harry Goldfarb. Marlon Wayans is usually in bad, over-the-top comedies, so I was really surprised with his excellent performance as Tyrone Love. I personally do not care for Jennifer Connelly, she wasn't bad as Marion though, just wasn't great either. And Christopher McDonald was perfect as Tappy Tibbons, the icon of Sara's TV addiction, who runs a talk-show talking about how he managed to lose weight and gain his life back.This movie wasn't perfect, but was still great. It claws into your senses and burrows in deep, making you really get the full-blast of what this movie is trying to tell you. This movie could be a weapon in fighting against the mass drug-use in this country.9/10."
forzosky,"Mar 1, 2024",6/10,"This is probably the most disturbing thing I've ever watched.I felt sick to my stomach watching this film and honestly I think I wish I hadn't watched it. If your goal is to shock yourself into quitting drug abuse, maybe this is a good movie for you. I feel like I need to see a therapist or something after watching this. It really dives into what it looks like to break down a human until they are nothing but a shell.All this being said, it is a movie that made me feel such strong emotions and for that reason I give it a high rating. I can't imagine what the actors had to go through during the filming of this.If you are looking for a very dark, unsettling movie this is it.If not, go out with some friends or family and appreciate your life."

Why? Because I've never felt so emotionally manipulated in my life."
wdanehy,"Jun 9, 2001",N/A,"I think the people criticizing the film for being ""style over substance"" because of the fancy editing have missed the point. The director seems to be using these effects for a purpose, to portray psychological time accurately, and in my opinion he succeeds. By slowing down time in some scenes or by speeding up events, he is showing us how it feels to be his characters, either under the influence of a drug or in a hurry to the next fix.Also notice that he does not hit us all at once with these devices. He starts out slow and gradually builds to the horrifying climax. I am not claustrophobic but I felt that way during the final 15 minutes all because the movie forced me to understand on a psychological level what was happening."
jorgitofunes,"Dec 4, 2019",10/10,"This film is 10 times more disturbing than any horror movie, the acting makes the characters feel like real people, the writing is brilliant and it the editing is at its absolute best. Ever. Absolute must see."
DarkSpotOn,"Apr 3, 2022",10/10,"I have seen this film two years ago i believe, and it is still one of the greatest films out there. This is how it should be done. You got characters to care for, relate to, and feel horrible for. Every single character here has it's own tragic story, and it makes your heartbroken. The acting is amazing, the story is perfect, and hands down one of the best films out there to check out. This film is a masterpiece, and it deserves all the love and respect it has. It would be a pity for me to spoil what happens, but this is the kind of content schools should provide kids to watch, instead of a stupid system that we willingly accept. Imagine a child watching this film when they are 12, 13, they most likely never will try drugs, prostitution or robbery. Instead in a corrupted system, you got children watching stuff like Lil Pump, 6ix9ine that straight up promote all of the content that this movie is fighting against! This film is a masterpiece and it deserves to be seen by everyone. This is how it should be done."
steveinadelaide,"Jul 10, 2022",10/10,"REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a shocking, compelling, and visually stunning film that explores the tragic downward spiral of addiction. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., the film follows the lives of four people as they descend into a world of drugs and desperation.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important one. The performances are all excellent, but it is Jared Leto's turn as Harry Goldfarb that stands out. Leto gives a brave and heartbreaking performance as a young man who becomes addicted to heroin and will do anything to get his next fix. Alongside his spiral downwards, Harry's mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn) becomes addicted to diet pills in a desperate attempt to lose weight and be accepted by society. As their addiction grows, both Harry and Sara lose touch with reality and descend into a world of hallucinations and delusion.The film's director, Darren Aronofsky, uses innovative camera work and editing to create a visually arresting film that is as difficult to watch as it is impossible to forget. Aronofsky never shies away from the horrific realities of addiction, and the result is a powerful and tragic film that will leave you reeling.A couple of things to remember if you are going to watch REQUIEM FOR A DREAM: 1) in Australia, the movie is rated R18+ and earns that rating. It contains strong drug use, sex, and nudity. 2) One of the scenes shows Sara (Harry's mother) being treated with Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT). ECT is not performed without anaesthetic nowadays, so the scene is not accurate in terms of modern medical practice. When ECT is applied today, it is given with general anaesthesia and muscle relaxants.This powerful and harrowing film is both difficult to watch and impossible to forget. One of the best movies I've seen about drug addiction."
hitchcockthelegend,"Jun 13, 2015",9/10,"What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition. All told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by Aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors. Love it or hate it, it's a film that simply can't be ignored, unsparing cinema produced by a most gifted director. 9/10"
diejohnny,"Aug 10, 2002",10/10,"Maybe the Academy Award voters saw something I didn't, but Ellen Burstyn's performance in ""Requiem for a Dream"" was far and away more impressive than Julia Roberts' in ""Erin Brockovich."" Now, don't get me wrong, Julia was good, but Ellen Burstyn is absolutely brilliant as Sara Goldfarb. It's one of the best performances I've ever seen.This overwhelming film is supported by great visual/ audio techniques, an unbelievably powerful score and inspired acting from the entire cast. This is not ""the feel-good movie of the summer,"" so be forewarned. If you're anything like me, you'll be left stunned after the gut-wrenching climax.Director David Fincher said he's not as interested in movies that entertain than movies that scar. This is a movie that scars.10+"
Pedro_H,"Mar 25, 2009",7/10,"Four loosely connected people get caught up in the world of prescribed and illegal drugs.Pretend this is a school project. Write a first draft of a screen play about the subject and where it all leads. Just kidding, just pretend you have. Then go to this movie and tick the boxes: Yes it is fun, fast and making life better in the early days, but in the end it is just downward spiral towards despair, degradation and serious illness.Given the story is just one giant cliché (in capital letters), the question is how well and how originally the cliché is played out. I have to say pretty well. If you enjoy hip-hop and fast cutting. Some real low budget style from Darren Aronosky. Keeps it moving along at a steady clip.Yes, the budget is pretty low and the actors a little bit too good looking (Jared Leno is the only junkie I have seen with a six pack), but this is for the MTV generation. Bad/good messages have to a bit of boom-boom-boom in the background or the audience will fall asleep.Oscar people love over-the-top (look at the rewards for Deniro and Nicolson) and Ellen Burstyn makes it to the red carpet by going completely and utterly bonkers. So bonkers that you ask, how could she have got on a subway train? Found a building? And what happens to her after makes no sense either. They don't force feed people/shock people like that in hospitals - that went out decades ago! The script is as mad and over-the-top as her fantasy world.I don't take drugs. Not from a moral or legal point of view, only that I have never viewed self poisoning as a way of making my life better. If coke was on offer at the local petrol station I wouldn't touch it. Some people do, that is their knee-jerk. I am not better than these people, only different. Who connects with this story (and some must look at the IMDb rating!), it must be people who think, ""drugs have a place and can help."" As I said before, maybe they can for a while.The popularity of the film is a clear indication that people need - still - reminding about what they are really doing and where it can lead. Requiem is a small failure in that it doesn't seek to highlight lives that were going anywhere or leading to anything anyway. If you prostitute yourself you are obviously capable of prostituting yourself. Despite being movie cliché and law - some people don't prostitute themselves even when starving. However they never get their lives portrayed on film. And sex is always exploitation in film - even when it is pretending not to be..."
Keemer44,"Jan 19, 2021",10/10,"This is one of the very few films that can leave a person with a lasting impression. Requiem thoroughly encapsulates the horrors of drug addiction with the use of imagery, disturbing incidents, and realistic acting. It may not be for everyone, and it may very well be a one-time watch for many, but for any film lover, there is no question that this is an essential watch. The structure of this film is perfect."
joana98,"May 9, 2021",7/10,"I came here expecting a masterpiece but it's just the descending into a psychosis of the characters.

How beautiful and fragile Jared Leto character was. A lost boy in a merciless reality."
MichaelHoward,"Dec 2, 2000",N/A,"The BeginningHubert Selby Jr. wrote a novel in 1979 about four addicts on a downward spiral entitled Requiem for a Dream.  Working alongside young writer/director Darren Aronofsky (Pi), Selby co-wrote the screenplay based on the novel.  The film is now in select theaters.The MovieRequiem for a Dream follows the life of four characters, (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn) connected to one another by family or friendship, trying to live a happy life.  Leto is a young man trying to make a lot of money selling drugs with Wayans in order to start a real business with his girlfriend, Connely.  Burstyn plays the mother of Leto's character and she dreams of being on television and losing the weight she has acquired over the years in order to do so. While Requiem is obviously an anti-drug film, it goes one step further and is more about addictions and self-destructive behaviors.  The characters are trapped in a vicious circle of behaviors that are impossible to escape and only grow deeper as time moves on.  The dreams fall further and further away as they enter a downward drug spiral. When people hear a movie is NC-17, they automatically think of hardcore sex or excessive violence.  And most of the time, they're right.  But Requiem is about the realism that goes along with drug use and addiction and the hopes and dreams that are shattered because of it.  The film should be seen and appreciated for the message it presents.  But because it's NC-17, many people won't even give it a chance.The ReviewAmazingly powerful and poignant. Now, marijuana is one thing.  Folks who say, `drugs aren't that bad, I've smoked weed here and there and I'm fine' don't know a thing about big time drug use.  Watching the characters in this film use hard drugs and then watching as their lives are slowly destroyed is not an easy thing to sit through.  Director Darren Aronofsky makes sure that you don't take it lightly with his quick editing and extreme imagery that is sure to stun. This film truly shows the horrible life that drugs can lead to.  And for you weed aficionados out there, this isn't nearly the same thing. Ellen Burstyn is absolutely remarkable.  I have not seen much of her work but she is top notch here.  This was not a simple role and she was completely convincing as well as touching and diverse.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely both shine in their roles.  They share a sweet relationship even through the rough times as drugs lead their lives in terrible directions.  Marlon Wayans was terrific.  After seeing his comedy sketches and Scary Movie, I was unsure he could pull this type of role off but he did it well.  As we hope for all of the characters to pull through, Aronofsky gives us the realistic resolutions that happen in the life of drug users. The cinematography is wonderful as it changes with the seasons in the film and the characters ever darkening lifestyles.  The soundtrack is mesmerizing and perfectly suits the film.  Many argue that the editing of the film is pretentious or down right excessive.  The difference in shots and, most importantly, the drug use scenes are critical parts in the delivery of this film.  See it and you'll know what I mean. Because this film is NC-17, theaters will not allow admittance to anyone under 17, even if the parent is there and approves.  At the age of 22, I got carded trying to see it.  Hell, I had to travel an hour to Denver to see it because conservative Colorado Springs won't show it.  And even in Denver, it was only available in one theater.  There is a big spectacle about young people seeing this.  I would rather it be Unrated or NC-17 than to have seen it cut down to an R rating.  Cutting down this film would take away from the entire point and the true affect would have been lost.  I also think that this movie should be seen by a younger demographic because in many instances, that's where drug use and addiction begins.  Sure, there are many scenes of gratuity and brutal honesty in the depiction of drug use and the surrounding life but that's the point.  And this is the type of film that can stop people from pursuing that type of life.  And instead of turning teenagers off to that type of lifestyle, we're keeping one of the biggest reasons for them to avoid drugs away from them.  But hey, they can always watch flicks like Natural Born Killers, right?  Since we forbid them from seeing a gripping film about drug use, we'll make it up to them by letting them watch all sorts of films filled with sex and violence everywhere else. Bravo. No other film I know of can compare to the reality that Requiem for a Dream portrays and the emotional turmoil surrounding such events. Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, to name a couple, don't even come close.  The film is hard to stomach for many people because the images are definitely disturbing.  But so is drug use.  This film spares nothing in showing the viewer the lengths people will go to in order to feed their addictions and the results that come from it all."
walirlan,"Mar 26, 2025",10/10,"""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) is not just a movie - it feels like a nightmare you cannot escape. It is strong, painful, and full of emotion. It shows addiction in a real and scary way, with no lies or soft pictures.The acting is amazing. Ellen Burstyn shows so much sadness and fear that it is hard to forget. The music and fast editing make the story feel intense and real.The worst part is how the world treats people like they are not human. The doctors, the system, society - they do not help, they destroy.This movie hurt me. I couldn't watch another film that day. I just needed silence.It broke me... maybe even more than that.One of the best movies I've ever seen. 10/10. A dark masterpiece."
nickzbekool,"Nov 11, 2006",10/10,"amazing. truthful.raw. very good story of how dangerous drugs and desperation is. an ensemble cast.4 people each pursing their vision of happiness no matter how dangerous it is.

Top_Dawg_Critic,"Jul 11, 2017",10/10,"Darren Aronofsky's directing and Hubert Selby Jr.'s screenplay combined created this riveting visual masterpiece!Top it all off with excellent cinematography and editing, and you have a film that is jaw-dropping.My regret is seeing the trailer first - of which did not really give the jaw-dropping scenes away, but still set the stage of what I'd expect. Had I gone into this blind, it would have had more of a shock value. So if you know nothing about this film, and are considering watching it, DON'T watch the trailer... just hit PLAY and sit back for a wild ride!Outstanding performances by Ellen Burstyn (not your everyday mom!), Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans and especially Jared Leto, who's character was very convincing.This is one of those films that will keep you thinking for a long time after you've seen it. Certainly needs to be in every movie buffs collection.A perfect 10/10 from me!"
liddyzissou,"Mar 19, 2006",10/10,"Needless to say, anyone who has viewed this film with an open mind, and has carefully considered the cinematography and sound, will be able to conclude it is a wonderfully made piece of art. Also, it is quite disturbing also, visually and mentally. The characters are portrayed to perfection; anyone who has read the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. can agree with that statement. This is one of very few films that truly ""moved"" me. Not moved necessarily in a good way, but moved. It should be noted anyone considering viewing this must keep in mind it will not leave you feeling happy and ready to take on the world. Rather, it will possibly upset the viewer, and if it doesn't accomplish that, it will at least leave you pondering much of your own ways in life.This is one of the best films made in the last twenty years, and the mix of great visuals, amazing sound, and a great cast combine to make it so. I own the film and have watched it at least twenty times. One thing I can say with confidence is I have never duplicated the feeling I had when I first watched it. I was left so speechless it amazed me, as few movies can really do that to me. Every time I watch it, I am left feeling reflective to say the least, but the first viewing is almost an out-of-body experience which will go un-matched for most. I say watch it, and really take it in as a whole, otherwise you will have missed out on a great opportunity to learn something about yourself and life in general."
space-13,"Jun 30, 2002",6/10,"It's surprising to see how many people are being duped by the director of this pretentiously and gratuitously violent film.  What the director offers are quick fixes of rapid fire imagery and viciously cut scenes without any need or opportunity for the audience to think hard or deeply about anything. Take,for example, his treatment of the character played by Jennifer Connelly. How is his degradation of that character any different than her debasement by the other men who exploit her for their cruel pleasure? The director consistently keeps his view of her ""objective"" in the literal sense of presenting her as an object -- upon which he projects his own fantasies of how an addicted woman would sell herself. Why doesn't he allow her to have any inner, believable life that could make her more real and make her conflicts more intense? (His objectification of her is so extensive that it feels at the end as if he is one of the men zeroing in on her pain to feed their horrifying pleasure.) Ellen B's character is more fully drawn, but even then, why does the director need multiple shots of electric shock treatment when one shot would show what she is feeling? The answer is that the director knows the fix his audience is seeking.  We say we're appalled, but we can't stop watching what the slick photography and postmodern soundtrack turn into the very kind of media-induced high that his movie supposedly is critiquing. Wake up, audiences, and try to think for yourselves. The best directors want us to do that; the worst are afraid of what will happen if we dare to do so."

The mother of one of the friends wants to lose weight so gets some weight loss pills prescribed by the world's most self absorbed doctor. How will it all turn out?A hard but gripping watch...

silviada-14403,"Oct 4, 2021",7/10,I would say the first 40 min do not offer much and the whole film abuses of brutal and gross scenes without need.However it gets the point as it will make you feel extremely anxios and sick. The las 40 minutes all I wanted was for it to finish.Great performance and character for Sarah.
Carch,"May 29, 2002",1/10,"If you subscribe to the masochistic belief that great art must be painful, then by all means, see Requiem for a Dream. If, on the other hand, you'd rather not spend 2 hours having Aronofsky pick at you like a scab, skip it. The director's intention is clearly to upset you, give you a headache, and instill in you a hatred of addictive behavior. He succeeds marvelously.Wayans, in the closing sequence of the film, vomits into a bucket of some white viscous somethingorother he's stirring.That about sums up my reaction to Requiem for a Dream."
kickmeplenty,"Jun 14, 2001",N/A,"You know Darren Aronofsky is a great director when you see his name above the title in large letters, and it's only his second picture (the first being the excellent Pi).Requiem follows the tale of four people's journey into spiraling into addiction, whether it be food, cocaine, weight-loss pills, etc, etc. The message hear is clear: Addiction can come in any form, any shape or size. But the movie NEVER becomes preachy, and does not hesitate to show graphic images (if you are looking for lots and lots of nudity, you will sorely be disappointed) of the drug's effect, using what Aronofsky appropriately, 'Hip-Hop Montage', which is basically quick images and sounds thrown at the viewer, along with many fast-forward parts, during the drug scenes. All of this style really shouldn't work with the subject matter, and turn it into nothing but an MTV film (cough, The Cell, cough, Hallow Man, cough, cough) and is probably the first serious drama that used so many special effects shots (keep your eye out for the revolutionary 'Snorrie Cam', which is a camera attatched to a person's body part, like the head) but...the whole thing is successful.PlotEllen Burstyn plays an overweight mother who just gets a call to be on a game show. Excited, she tries on her 'red dress', which doesn't fit, and ends up resorting to weight-reduction pills (which are really speed) and the red dress is her source of the addiction, she wants to get in the dress, but the pills have horrible consequences.Then, there are three drug dealers (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly) hoping to make it big on a sale. Their own paths change, for the very worst.The plot's simple, the charcters are four-dimensional. In fact, all four actors probably give their best performances ever, and Burstyn actually deserved that oscar more than Julia Roberts - her character is the most human, and, like the whole cast, totally believable. Marlon, fresh off of Scary Movie, also shows that he is indeed a great actor.The Bad?The whole thing is very dark. Too dark for some. If you are a little squemish, or faint of heart, please avoid this film. You may think, ""Hey, it's just a movie"", but some people have been actually pretty disturbed by its dark nature (It was released to only a few theateres because Artisan knew the NC-17 would give it the flush. It should have been called ""Requiem for a Nightmare"".Overall, if you find it at a store, pick it up (the DVD is especially great) and watch it with a high school student or by yourself or whatever (this is definitely not a date movie), just watch it. Better than Gladiator in my book."
erentuna-97421,"Nov 29, 2020",9/10,A very depressing drama that will make you feel like the walls are closing in.
juliaochaya,"Jun 26, 2020",10/10,"This movie deeply disturbed me. I was thinking of it everyday for about a year after I saw it. It's a heavy but a very important movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. Truly hats off to Darren Aronofsky for managing to make such an impressively impactful movie.
Also the acting is truly phenomenal especially Ellen Burstyn!!!"
adamonIMDb,"Mar 1, 2020",10/10,"Like a lot of people, I'd heard the music from 'Requiem for a Dream' before I'd actually seen the film. Indeed it was that classic soundtrack that drew me into watching it. Based on the music, I was expecting something dramatic, haunting and disturbing, but I never expected something as powerful and meaningful as what I watched.'Requiem for a Dream' is an outstanding film in every respect, in fact it quite comfortably makes my 'all-time best' list. The reason this film is so effectively disturbing - even uncomfortable to watch at times - is because the characters and their stories are so accurate of real-life. Tyrone, Harry, Sarah and Mary Ann are not fictional characters, they represent the millions of people in the world who have lost their freedom, body, mind or soul due to drugs. It's a harrowing watch, but essential viewing at the same time.On a side note and mainly just for personal reference, this review marks my 500th on this site - hard to believe given that I only signed up (almost four years ago now) to vent my frustration about a dreadful TV show that I'd seen. Life has become a lot busier since then and it's hard to find the time to sit down a write a review, but I've every intention of continuing to post when I can... so here's to the next 500!"
liamscherdin,"Jan 2, 2023",9/10,When making a movie about drugs and addiction it's quite easy as a director to slip and fall in the insubstantial trap. Meaning that everything that plays out is too far from reality. When you create a movie who's story is based on real life situations about drugs and addiction and make it too far from reality it just comes out as a big mess. Following that the viewers won't be able to feel and experience what the characters in the movie is feeling. Darren Aronofsky defenetly did'nt fall for this trap which led to him making in my opinion one of the best movies I've ever watched.I sat with a gut wrenching feeling throughout the last 20 minutes of this film. I felt for the characters in a way no other film had done. When the end credits rolled I sat in my couch and stared into the screen with some many emotions and did'nt know what to do. That my friends is how you know a movie is top tier.9/10 would defeneltly recommend but only to be watched once.
dr_anant,"Jan 1, 2007",10/10,"It was very difficult to get a DVD of this movie in India n after a lot of searching, managed to buy one.In medical college n also other colleges, u see people on cannabis with a few capricious beings trying cocaine n ketamine n the like..they go on with their life, u do your thing. Advice isn't well appreciated n anyway, cynicism is a quality fast imbibed in college. After seeing this movie, which is like a 1000 Floydian hammers smashing through your head, u wonder. Everyone of those idiots in college could have ended up this way. Much as the end of this movie was designed to represent the worst case scenario, its one hell of a fright. The smiles n quirkiness quickly turning to tragedy - scary and effective. Jared leto's mum in the movie - Deserved an Oscar if there ever was one."
Rashae107,"Nov 3, 2020",10/10,"This movie is Aronofsky's best! With the brutal in your face addiction, depression, and rock bottom it's one of a kind. It's honest in it's raw, and never seen subject matter. Top 10 of all time best!"
bgood26,"Aug 17, 2003",7/10,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is written to scare the hell out of anyone who even thinks of using drugs.Ellen Burstyn was Oscar worthy as Sara, the lonely Jewish mother who passes time by watching TV and talking to the other old Jewish women on her block in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She's important to no one until she receives a mysterious call telling her she's going to be on TV. She finds a red dress that she hasn't worn in years and no longer fits into. She sees her doctor, who prescribes weight-loss stimulants. She quickly becomes addicted to both TV and the pills, begins hallucinating, and eventually suffers full-blown schizophrenia.Jared Leto is Sara's son Harry. His drugs of choice are marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) score and distribute the drugs around the Coney Island-Brighton Beach area. (Wayans is an ironic choice, as he is pro-drug and thinks addiction is something to joke about, as evidenced by his ""Scary Movie."")The incredibly beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is Marion, Harry's girlfriend. She gets hooked almost immediately, and her dire need of future fixes is rough. But her frantic search for drugs around the apartment mid-way through the film is gut-wrenching.My main problem with the movie is this: Am I supposed to feel sorry for these three cokeheads? Because I don't. Unlike Sara, whose ethically challenged doctor prescribed her addictive drugs, they made a conscious decision to use. In a way, they got what they deserved. My other problem is that I did not need the extreme closeups of dilating eyes, popping pills, coke snorts, and nickle bags being zip-locked. The sound effects got really annoying too. I got the hint the first time around; they didn't need to repeat it a dozen times.The end of this film is absolutely brutal. Addiction defeats all of the characters in different ways; they all suffer different fates, all horrible."
elsiemsen,"Aug 3, 2018",10/10,"Graphic and disgusting in all the right ways and incredibly captivating. I wasn't sure it was ""my type of movie"" but if you've been touched by drug addiction in any way (most people have been) then this movie is a must watch."
mar-wit,"Apr 2, 2015",5/10,"ared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definitely deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.The other characters themselves hold their own with the two above-mentioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem."
drmrvandertramps,"Jul 21, 2002",N/A,"After hearing the countless good reviews of this movie, i rented it this weekend and watched it this afternoon. It's incredibly fast-paced, i found, where you as the viewer are treated to a barrage of short clips throughout the movie. These segments do a good job of making you feel uncomfortable, and i assume that was one of the director's intentions.  It was one of the saddest movies i've ever seen, due mainly to its realism."
rodrigocaetano-60602,"Aug 15, 2021",10/10,"This movie was scarier than a horror movie. Narrating the lives of four people with their different addictions, it's scarier than most horror movies filled with jump scares and supernatural stuff, this is the real horror, the real life horror. People go through all this during their lifetime and the rest of the world doesn't even care about it, we don't even notice what's around us, only caring about ourselves and our busy lives. Spectacularly terrifying, realistic and necessary. An absolute masterpiece only to be seen once."
educallejero,"Sep 2, 2018",10/10,"I promised myself that I was never going to rewatch this movie. After years and years of the easiest promise ever, I succumbed to the temptation to see if it still holds up.This movie deals with drugs abuse in the least exciting and glorifying way possible.If this isn't film as art... then I don't really know what is. It works at every level. As a message about drugs, as we see the self destruction of four lives in a slow and excruciating demonstration of addiction. Also as an experimental film with weird editing and cinematography and a great score.Also at acting, because we watch a clear descend into drug madness and all the changes the personalities of the characters go through as they fall.It might be a bit over the top here and there, but it is mostly grounded.One of the best decisions was not to pay too much attention at the ""fun"" the guys were getting with their hits. They skip the ""fun part"" that 90% of movies about the subject get so enamored to.And with that, Darren Aronofsky created a masterpiece that is a punch in the face to Hollywood usual and glorifying portrayal of drugs... the punch goes also to our stomach."
pedro_fernandes_nunes,"Dec 29, 2013",9/10,"This movie was considerer by Premiere as one of the 25 most dangerous movies, and i really feel like it is. Darren Aronofsky gives us a amazing movie about drugs, how it changes our lives, by showing how time can go faster or slower with the more than 2000 cuts that make us always be on the edge. It also reveals the dark side of the human condition who prefers a drug induced utopia than to do something meaningful to change their lives. It shows dramatically the pain of the characters and their endless search for something that at the end they always knew they wouldn't be able to achieve. The futility of current society is showed on the shallow goals of the characters who prefer a tragic ending than to choose different things for their lives.Although all the performances are very good, there's no shadow of a doubt that Ellen Burstyn gives a performance of a life as Sara Goldfarb, we feel her pain, we understand her needs, we feel her desire...Ellen makes totally drawn to a character who gets what she wants and no one deserves. And i believe everyone's heart gets broken when we see when she finally got in the red dress and that's the only thing that she now has in her live, a red dress who fitsA great movie that i highly recommend"
doninsandimas,"Oct 21, 2000",10/10,"Others have reviewed this movie so well.  I only want to add that the score and sound editing were superb from beginning to end.

I will never, ever, forget this film.  A definite must see."

VANILLAxxGORILLA,"Sep 20, 2009",10/10,"Never has a film been made that captures the disease of addiction like this one. It will haunt you for days. And if you're an addict, it will haunt you for the rest of your life.This film knows its subject. Knows what most of the world don't. Drugs are not the problem. They are a temporary cure, or maybe just a symptom of a devastating disease that manifests itself whether you're using or not. You can see it in the subtle behaviors of the characters that are brilliantly acted by the films four stars. You can see the sadness in Marlon Wayans's character as a child, long before he ever picked up his first drug. That scene with his mother is one of the most powerful aspects of this film, as it shows that addiction is a disease that is ever present long before the use of drugs becomes an issue. Reaffirming that no matter what you think, will power cannot save you.The film is criticized for extensive cuts and repetitive images. But I know better. I'm a recovering addict, and not some, but all 12 step programs define insanity as this: doing THE SAME THING over and over and over again; expecting different results. The films ability to show this visually, constantly darkening with every repeat, is metaphoical genius.Some may like the endings to the laughably unrealistic, Clean & Sober, or even the Basketball Diaries( which if you read Jim Carols second diary you'd know that his story didn't end that way). And like Requiem's sad conclusion, the truth is the ends are ALWAYS the same; jails, institutions, and death. Because if you pull any four addicts out into the spot light, there chances of recovery and survival are most likely a dream."
jay-22797,"Jan 31, 2025",7/10,"This kind of curiosity behavior insults a great and outstanding movie. It has to be pointed out that in fact, 'Requiem of Dreams' is a forgotten film, which is too outstanding and has a dark theme, leading to its forgetfulness. After careful attention, one day you may discover that it was also listed in IMDB and its ranking can be taken seriously. It has outstanding performances by actors, sharp editing by directors, high-speed switching of images, amazing montage, heart wrenching music, and a heavy theme that modern people should reflect on for a long time.If you want to correct the shortcomings of the film. I think: its excellence comes from its theme, but it is also destroyed by its theme. The film gives us no hope."
