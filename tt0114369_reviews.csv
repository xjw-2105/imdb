preppy-3,"Feb 14, 2008",9/10,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting."
TheLittleSongbird,"May 18, 2010",10/10,"From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
tomgillespie2002,"Mar 1, 2014",10/10,"After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
jpevoto,"Aug 13, 1999",N/A,"Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (""This isn't going to be a happy ending"") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first."
chvylvr80,"Oct 15, 2003",10/10,"Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it.Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life.John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore."
Boba_Fett1138,"Apr 30, 2004",10/10,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 15, 2022",10/10,"A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.10/10."
tsatsas,"Jun 20, 2002",10/10,"Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes."
purebace,"Dec 4, 2003",10/10,"This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film.  The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt's supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.The movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting.  There is a ""Pseudo-Noir"" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.  As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.  In this respect, the film doesn't ""preach"" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.  This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.Outstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****"
winner55,"Oct 14, 2007",9/10,"Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way."
ShyRaptor,"May 26, 2017",10/10,"""Se7en"" (1995) is a true masterpiece. I have seen this film like a thousand times and every time I watch it again it's as disturbing as the first time. It's always intriguing from start till finish. This is one of the best stories ever told on screen. 10/10 for this motion picture, it's a true art. A must watch."
Degree7,"Dec 19, 2014",8/10,"Se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another.It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers.There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti.Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion.I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. For those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of."
jcarlos-96740,"Mar 5, 2020",6/10,"I don't really understand the hype over this movie, it has a good cast and it is a good movie but it's different to be good and to be one of the greatest and this movie has nothing that makes it one of the greatest. The only interesting thing here is that the killer uses the seven deadly sins but even this premise could've been better used, the plot twist is kinda shocking but isn't one of the best ones, ain't one of those jaw dropping ones, at least not for me. The actors did normal nothing especial here too. I love movies of this kind but I got bored watching this and is really nothing special about it, just a massive disappointment"
pooch-8,"Aug 16, 1999",N/A,"David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking you off the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision."
namashi_1,"Sep 24, 2015",10/10,"David Fincher has made remarkable films throughout his career, but 'Se7en' finds him at his FINEST! This neo-noir psychological-thriller, is an astonishing piece of Cinema. I was mesmerized.'Se7en' Synopsis: Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi.'Se7en' is a Masterstroke from start to end. A dark, moody, violent & utterly gripping story, that keeps you at the edge-of-your-seat. There isn't a single dull moment in this blockbuster, in fact, the tale gets more & more intriguing as it progresses.Andrew Kevin Walker's Screenplay is Ace. It's a spine-chilling tale about two heroes out to get a psychotic killer. The Writing grips you from the moment it begins & refuses to let you go. Fincher's Direction is incredible. The way he has handled this twisted story, deserves an ovation. Darius Khondji's Cinematography is flawlessly done. Richard Francis-Bruce's Editing is tight. Action-Sequences are mind-blowing. Howard Shore's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: Morgan Freeman is at his understated best. The Oscar-Winning Legend delivers a master-class act here, that ranks amongst his finest to date. Brad Pitt is in terrific form, adding depth & anger to his part. Kevin Spacey is loathsome to the core in his creepy portrayal of the wicked villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful in a brief, yet important role.On the whole, 'Se7en' is a film to die for. Two Big Thumbs Up!"
manoj-aryan,"Jun 16, 2005",8/10,"'He is preaching.punishing'.Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage.It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shittyand we get used to them"".This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen.Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic."
Screen_Blitz,"Nov 20, 2015",10/10,"David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart."
supah79,"Jul 28, 2005",9/10,"After the Alien-debacle Fincher proved all the critics wrong. This film is one of the best in a genre that hasn't been very innovative for a long time.Everyone know's the story by now, so I won't waste time telling it. This film was trend setting with it's dark, gritty look and opening sequence. We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today. Everything is great about this film. I guess if anything, the weakest link in the film is Pitt, who is grossly overshadowed by Freeman. But let's not look for flaws when there really aren't any. The script is intelligent and uncompromising. The direction is innovative en daring. The production-design and cinematography are top-notch.Fincher is one of the big boys in Tinseltown these days. Seven is the reason why."
bob the moo,"Mar 29, 2002",N/A,"`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man.  With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him.  However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise.  Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created.  Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold.  The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller.  But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out.  From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc.  The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do.  Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen.  I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's."
ElMaruecan82,"Jun 11, 2012",10/10,"""Se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like ""Chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.""Se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""Se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of ""Se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed  an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though ""Se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.Again, ""Se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence."
heatsilver,"Sep 21, 2016",10/10,"Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic naïve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film."
richardtownsley-19550,"Jun 16, 2020",10/10,"Se7en remains one of the most disturbing movies I have ever watched. Unlike many other movies made during and since its release, Se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. Over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. What may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. So instead of showing the results of the crime, director David Fincher uses a somewhat Hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'LUST' scene and 'SLOTH' scene, Fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. Fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('PRIDE' had it easy) The acting is incredible, featuring one of Morgan Freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. However, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays John Doe. Observe his acting. Smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. His composure and fearlessness. The movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. He does. His performance is just as affecting as Anthony Hopkin's in Silence of the Lambs. But the most impressive feat of all, David Fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. It is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. And that's terrifying. We all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. These types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. This is you. It's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden."
adamkasher,"May 19, 2021",5/10,"It really brings nothing new, it's basically a long CSI episode with no edge to it what so ever. It all was very predictable, and in the end of the day there wasn't a single scene in the movie made me go 'WOW'. It just that nothing felt new, in contrast to what films of that supposed caliber should do. I think most of the love to it is deriving from people tendency to get excited from the two main actors, especially freeman for some unclear reason.All in all it is a pretty standard movie, that's the problem with it and unfortunately also the only source of it's positives.I'm not usually reviewing movies, but this one felt so blatantly overrated to me that I felt like I have to."
sandnair87,"Mar 24, 2015",10/10,"Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence – no spoilers here!) is a cliché pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror.Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!"
ShadowRomeo1784,"Mar 3, 2017",9/10,"My Personal Rating - 8.5/10 - This Film is also great the acting the atmosphere is good. especially the ending, i won't spoil anything, just watch this film if you love suspense, mystery, a little bit horror in my opinion. and as always this film might not be for everyone obviously it's no mickey mouse kinda movie that a kid can watch. it's dark."
RickHarvey,"Nov 14, 2009",8/10,"Thrillers are either a hit or a miss. They can be awesome while many can be awful. Seven is in the Very awesome category. Basing the film around the seven deadly sins is an concept that everyone can relate too. We have all sinned meaning we can be put ourselves in the shoes of the victims ( not all victims mind you ) . When you imagine a film in which it always cloudy and overcast with rain pouring down 24/7 , you would think it going to depress you . Truth is , you don't actually notice the weather , but instead take huge interest on what happening in the homes of the city.I'm not an huge fan of Brad Pitt but it seems that when he teams up with Fincher , he always puts on an good performance. Then there's Morgan Freeman, which is fairness, is playing Morgan Freeman. He fun to watch but you know what type of performance he going to act out. Both are very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in it for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable. His character is well made and maybe deserves a bit more screen time . The film is very well made and an joy to watch. It keeps you awake and leaves you to wonder about the next deadly sin. When watching it, you can clearly see that Seven was an influence towards Leigh Whannell and James Wan and there SAW film. Everything about SEVEN was great, the concept, the acting, the finale. I highly recommend this film."
fatalsin80,"May 21, 2015",10/10,"This was an awesome movie! Spacey should have won an Oscar he was devilishly cruel and good! Even Brad Pitt had a stellar outing in this as the young cop with something to prove, beautiful lady at home etc.. Morgan Freeman as the smart older and on the verge of retiring cop but is pulled back in for this one last case.. is excellent. Its a shame this didn't receive more Oscar attention. It really found its groove later on I suppose as a classic. Not recommended as a family film has a lot of violence as its a take on the 7 deadly sins. Overall this movie was a 10 for me the cast the directing the story line was dynamite! Well worth a watch a time or two!"
Phillip-Riback,"Jul 31, 2013",10/10,"Its today's cult status this movie gained thanks to the excellent work of director David Fincher (whom this was only the second major movie in his career) and screenwriter A.K.Walker (who also wrote the screenplay for ""8MM""). With this film Fincher ranked himself among the most wanted directors and gained a reputation of true heir of Hitchcock, which was confirmed by his later movies ""Play"" and ""Panic Room"". The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize Brad Pitt's acting (as in ""Fight Club"") which proved that he is not just a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but also showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a veteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of the killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the film is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders make it even more stressful. I was particularly impressed by the way murders were described, which are quite original and leave a big impression on the viewer. (Something like that was attempted in ""Resurrection"" with C.Lambert but not very successfully, and ""Saw"" - interesting, but not on a par with ""Se7en""). All in all this is an excellent and original movie which is rarely seen."
tomosp1965,"Mar 28, 2015",10/10,"This film may be the best film I have ever watched. I was gripped from start to finish and actually applauded when the credits started to roll. The last time I did that was when I watched 'The Sixth Sense'. The writing is exceptional, the plot believable and the acting is of the finest standard. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a great partnership, even though it would seem unlikely, given their different approaches to dealing with homicide cases.I would ask everyone to try not to second guess the outcome, but rather follow the clues, as the detectives do.This is a fine film of the finest quality, with an ending to make your hairs stand on end."
justine-goodwin09,"Nov 27, 2013",10/10,"I've watched this true masterpiece several times over the years,I have yet to watch a film that comes anywhere near it in terms of pure horror at the lengths humans will go to inflict pain on each other... The brilliance of this film is you don't see the acts been done,it's left to your own imagination. Brad Pitt,Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are fantastically cast , the setting is wet and dark,( you never find out where the city is meant to be ).A Constant feeling of dread runs through this film which I can only say is an absolute must watch movie. Its is in my(and many others) opinion, probably one the best films ever made in the history of film making .. WATCH IT!"
bradrufc,"Jun 13, 2019",10/10,"The film ""Se7en"", with outstanding performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, as well as a short but important performance from Gwyneth Paltrow, is a genius masterpiece of utter thrills, horror and the best suspense you will ever see. David Fincher's second cinematic release will leave you thinking for weeks on end, the build up to the ending is so insanely gripping you will not even realise that the film has finished after its unforgettable ending. The movie is paced fantastically, has an interesting dark visual style, a moody vibe, and is all round perfection."
muminndc,"Oct 30, 2016",8/10,"Seven is a detective movie of Brat Pitt and Morgan Freeman. This movie found a serial killer who killed people for their seven deadly sins. They are gluttony, sloth, pride, envy, greed, wrath, lust. Even the wife of Pitt was killed for the envy. The Killer John Doe used to envy the life of the detective Pitt that led to killing of his wife, Tracy in the morning when Pitt left the home for operation. The killer showed up and submitted in the police station with bloody hand and asked for lawyer and his help. However, he killed two other people that he wanted to show the detectives and took them to a barren high tension wiring places. Then a delivery van came and kept a box where Tracy's head was packed. In that morning, Doe killed her, she was pregnant. That misery Pitt could not afford and killed the Killer despite repetitive urge by Detective Somerset to stop firing. The quote of the Somerset is 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I like the second part'- Detective Somerset.This movie hugely used the idea coming from Divine Comedy, Purgatory of Dante and Canterbury's Tales by Chaucer."
maresal-musca,"Dec 28, 2015",9/10,"One of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's too bad that most of this genre movies aren't produced anymore during the last years. Best thrillers, in my opinion, are the ones from the '90s and early 2000. Why's that? Aren't there any good screenwriters? It's hard to find now days a good thriller that can blow you up. Most of them are at a 6 average mark or below and quite short (not so many over 1h30 min). Se7en has, almost everything that a thriller needs: action, emotion, curiosity, a good screenplay, good actors, unpredictable end and it is not a short movie. We have here a young Brad Pitt, that plays very well, a mid age Morgan Freeman as his mentor and a ""sick"" Kevin Spacey (in a good way, of course)."
tanzilnasib,"Aug 17, 2024",7/10,"Se7en is a movie that really sticks with you, not just because of its intense story but because of how it makes you feel. From the moment it starts, you're pulled into this bleak, rain-soaked world that feels almost suffocating. It's not just a movie about catching a killer; it's about confronting the darkness that exists in the world-and within ourselves.Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is the heart of the film. His character's weariness and wisdom come through in every scene, and you can feel the weight of all the years he's spent dealing with humanity's worst. Brad Pitt's Detective Mills, on the other hand, brings a raw energy that contrasts with Somerset's calm demeanor. You see the toll the case takes on him, especially as they get closer to unraveling the twisted mind of John Doe.Kevin Spacey's portrayal of John Doe is terrifyingly calm and calculated, making him one of the most unsettling villains I've ever seen. The murders, each representing one of the seven deadly sins, are horrifyingly creative, and the film's dark cinematography only adds to the sense of dread.The ending-wow. It hits like a punch to the gut, leaving you questioning everything. ""Se7en"" isn't just a crime thriller; it's a deep dive into the human psyche, showing how easily the line between good and evil can blur. It's a movie that leaves you thinking long after it's over."
Andrew_81,"Dec 9, 2004",N/A,"Although this film is 9 years old now it hasn't dated in the slightest and has more than likely been the influence for other serial killer films over the years; such as Taking Lives (2004) for that sheer twists value.I was only 14 when this film came out so I didn't get to watch it straight away, however after being blown away by it's storyline the first time I saw it (in about 1997, I think), I've since watched it several more times over the years and have been impressed every time. Be it by it's fantastic score (e.g. the library scene), it's sharp witted humour (e.g. when the police captain answers the phone with ""this isn't even my desk!"" - a phrase I'd love to use at my own desk at work everyday), or brilliant acting in the form of Morgan Freeman as Det. Somerset.The only part of this film I didn't enjoy was the ""SWAT"" team scenes. If David Fincher was aiming for OTT from the actors here, he certainly got it (especially from that bloke from Scrubs)The most compelling part of this film for me, and what stands out the most, is the relationship between Det. Mills and Somerset. Two detectives both with completely different lives and agendas both thrown together to solve the most disturbing case either of them will ever face. It's not a case of good cop/bad cop in this movie; it's more like overeager cop/retiring cop and by the end shocked cop/shocked (no longer retiring) cop/shocked audience.A truly great film, 9 out of 10 from me!"
Leviiiu,"Jul 20, 2025",10/10,"Are you kidding me what did I just watch oh my god the last five minutes of the movie took it to another level, I don't know if I should say they are the best five minutes I've ever watched in my life? The story of this movie is one of the most amazing stories I've never heard anything like it before the chase scene was beautiful too even though the movie was produced in 1995 one of the best movies in history. Ten minutes of chills I watched it in amazement and terror until the movie ended and I was shocked. This is the perfect ending. The acting was very beautiful from Brad Pitt,He is my favorite actor."
prasadgollakota,"Nov 9, 2024",9/10,"Se7en by David Fincher is a masterfully crafted thriller that sets the benchmark for tightly written, relentlessly suspenseful storytelling. The film's script is meticulously constructed, guiding viewers through a dark, disturbing plot that explores the seven deadly sins in a way that feels fresh and horrifying.Fincher's casting choices are pitch-perfect: Brad Pitt, as the brash young detective Mills, showcases his range and intensity, proving he's capable of more than just charisma, while Morgan Freeman delivers a nuanced performance as the world-weary Detective Somerset, whose quiet gravitas anchors the film. The interplay between Pitt's intensity, Freeman's restraint, and Kevin Spacey's chilling portrayal of the antagonist creates a brilliant counterbalance that enhances the film's moral and psychological weight.Over time, Se7en has become even more significant as a rare example of Hollywood's willingness to tackle grim, existential themes with sophistication-a rarity in an era of lighter, more conventional thrillers."
beardedmovieguy,"Mar 12, 2015",10/10,"Wow, here is the thing, most movies that have been out for a long time and I have been told that are great but have not got a chance to see yet, well, most of the time they never live up to the hype. That is not the case with Se7en. This is one amazing movie. The acting was stellar, directing was spot on and the use of the city and rain added so much atmosphere that it was almost another character in the film. I did see the end coming even though I was hoping that I was wrong.(I think I knew what was coming not because this movie was predictable, more so that after this movie lots of movies and TV shows have stolen from it, so it kind of easy to see where it was going, I am sure if I had seen this when it was first out I would have been surprised) This is a five star movie that I think will still be great 50 years from now. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review. http://youtu.be/WCVDBOziSrM"
Brazilian_Pharaoh,"Mar 22, 2017",8/10,"Inspired by the Divine Comedy (there are other religious books that inspire the villain but i don't remember them), the psicopath John Doe (Kevi Spacey) tries to teach a sermon by torturing people based on one of the seven deadly sins they are accused of committing.This movie biggest sin (pun intended) is that only became a masterpiece that it is known only half way through it. The first hour is a generic detective movie with all the clichés: the two cops who are opposite from each other(Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt), a murder mystery, etc.But aside from that, it's a great movie worth watching specially for the twist at the ending."
lbeattie-65122,"Apr 10, 2017",9/10,"Se7en is one of my favorite movies. I guess that says a lot about me. I can't pass it by when flicking through my cable guide. Every time I watch it I see or hear something new. Morgan Freeman is superb as a tired and emotionally beaten down cop getting ready to retire. Brad Pitt is very convincing as a young new detective running his first serial killer investigation with all the nerves and ambitious recklessness you'd expect from having to partner with a veteran on his last case before retirement. The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins. The real stars of this movie are the writer, director and set designers for presenting incredibly intricate and graphic murder scenes and making all the characters likable. The writing is deep and you have to pay attention to every detail. As the bodies mount you find yourself counting down each deadly sin to the incredible climax and shocking but truly awesome ending. You can't go wrong with the cast assembled in Se7en. It's a great movie for whodunit fans that like a little more tension and voyeurism in their crime dramas. It will not disappoint."

With the two Oscar-winning actors Morgan freeman as detective Someset and Brad Pitt as detective Mills in the lead this movie provides a energetic and true acting. Se7en is about a reckless serial killer killing ""innocent"" people related to the seven deadly sins of Christianity. Detective Somerset and Mills are put to on the case, but they're soon to know that the serial killer has a plan for them both. This movie is without a doubt a cult classic film. Because of its unique camera angels and editing as well as its quite absurd ending. It does make you think about the lifestyle that we are living in. Therefore i give this movie a solid 9/10!"

David Fincher has made this master piece in such a way the it will not make you feel boarded at all . The ending of the movies was the best as well as the darkest part of the movie which revolves in the viewers mind even after the move ends. Its one of the best Drama/Mystery movie I have seen. Overall this movie is outstandingly brilliant.
ryancortero,"Sep 14, 2020",9/10,"Seven is a mystery thriller with an interesting premise, which you should not look into before watching this. If you've seen Zodiac or Gone Girl, you'll like the feel of this movie (especially since they're all directed by David Fincher). The mystery surrounding this movie had me intrigued and was building up well. The ending was not what I was expecting but I think it was a good conclusion. Morgan Freeman is his same amazing self, and Brad Pitt does really well in his role. There is one more actor who sold his part well, but I don't want to spoil who that is. The score by Howard Shore fits well too. I would definitely rewatch this because there are definitely things to pick up on."
travola-35109,"Aug 13, 2022",10/10,Seven is the first time we ever really experienced Fincher (Alien 3 doesn't count!!). Great performances by a young Brad Pitt and the always reliable Morgan Freeman. Freeman is the highlight here and he should have gotten some awards consideration for Seven.Fantastic look and thriller story and one of the most talked about ending a of all time!! Highly recommend and watch at night to increase the the feel.
blueangel-76133,"Oct 1, 2019",5/10,"Despite the presence of the surely very talented Freeman and Pitt, this early David Fincher film is, like his other early films such as Alien 3, marred by his strange artistic obsession with grime and filth (every location and even the look of the film is dirty, scummy and excessively grimy for no realistic reason). Having said this, in his more recent films, such as The Game (Sean Penn and Michael Douglas), Fincher has grown out of this style and made some excellent movies."
Atif_AK,"Mar 18, 2017",9/10,"I developed phenomenally as a person when I saw this movie. Although not my favorite genre, but the plot is immaculate. I don't know how it can conceived this way. Was it a real story that was the inspiration behind. I don't know but just amazing. The performances, the direction, the editing, color grading, title- everything is near perfect. I became a fan of David Fincher, initially I thought it was a little talky but the movie is just hard to forget."
Sanjeev-902,"Jul 25, 2025",10/10,"I don't think I've ever watched a movie that left me feeling this shaken. Se7en isn't just a crime thriller - it's a full-blown descent into madness and morality. And it's absolutely brilliant.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman? Phenomenal duo. Their chemistry, their clashing perspectives - it just works. You've got the young, impulsive detective and the calm, experienced one trying to solve a series of murders that are straight-up horrifying.Every scene builds tension like crazy. The killer's plan is so twisted, so meticulously designed... and just when you think it can't get darker - boom. That ending.I sat there frozen. Couldn't move. Couldn't speak. I just kept repeating: ""No way. No way they actually did that.""And yeah... the ""What's in the box?"" scene? Pure cinema.David Fincher doesn't hold back here. This is gritty, intelligent, and emotionally devastating storytelling at its finest."
chavarriaviggo,"Jun 14, 2024",8/10,"Great crime story, and probably the best I've seen. The twist at the end got me completely by surprise, but I wish they had shown us more instead of abruptly ending. Story kept you reeled in, and the pacing was admirable. The killer's mindset near the end is contradicted by the final showdown which opened up some holes in the character that would not have been preconceived if there had been a different way of going about things. Someone who kills people who are labeled innocent by society but not by himself because of his examination of what sin they had committed alters his thinking for the involvement of Mills (Brad Pitt). Overall a great film that holds it's own on the shelf of noir films."
SnoopyStyle,"May 15, 2015",9/10,"Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wearied homicide detective. Mills (Brad Pitt) worked hard to transfer to the troubled precinct. He's married to Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). There is a serial killer on the loose delivering his sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Somerset is tired of the city. Mills is eager to investigate.Director David Fincher has filled with beautiful darkness. It's more than just the gruesome murders. It's the rain, the music score and the grungy setting. Fincher has weaved together an artistic masterpiece. Freeman is the perfect grizzled veteran. Brad Pitt is a terrific eager newcomer. There are surprising comedy sprinkled in. The final twist is simply cinematic history. The big line is awesome. Pitt delivers it perfectly with so much heart aching pleading. Some do deride its grotesque gloom but that's like complaining about a movie being too funny or too exciting. This is suppose to be dark and it achieves it."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Jul 8, 2005",10/10,"I went to a friends house last night and rented movies. I picked Se7en to rent because I've always wanted to see it since I saw David Fincher's masterpiece, Fight Club and his well made thriller, Panic Room. People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A"
rat_salad,"Jul 8, 2005",9/10,"This story takes you where it wants you to go.The proof is that while there are some gruesome acts in this movie (you only see the aftermath, no action), the most disturbing crime in the movie is the least gruesome.There are very few movies that pull-off a mix of repulsive crime and psychological involvement as well as this one.The character development was done very well with while not distracting you by burying you in the personal life of each characterInitially, I felt the main detective character was a little unbelievable a bit too methodical. As the character developed though, you start to see that as a part of his personality, the element that levels the playing field between him and the criminal. In the end, I found him to be as diabolically analytical as the criminal.The chess game between the main detective and the criminal was flawless. Had they got the criminal into custody any other way than they did.. it would have ruined the movie."

maidwell-45616,"Aug 22, 2020",10/10,"I remember walking out of the cinema at the end of this film in a daze, my brain incapable of computing the audacity it had been subjected to by the unhollywood ending and stylish bleakness on display for the previous couple of hours.
It hits you like a sledgehammer and won't let go. I love a movie that makes you FEEL, and seven does that every time I've watched it in the 25 years since.
It's not for the faint of heart or people who need to see a sunny outlook on humanity, it's far too real for that.
Fantastic acting, pitch perfect direction and screenplay combine to make a true classic of cinema.
If it passed you by in the 90s (or you weren't around then!)... give it a go, it has aged beautifully."
neon47,"May 11, 2005",10/10,"Se7en is great. Need I go on? Alright... Se7en starts off nicely making it look like another day at work. Well it is, but it's the beginning of something big. Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role. Overall this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the ending... oh buddy, the ending will getcha."
Leofwine_draca,"Mar 13, 2012",8/10,"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichéd characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time."
leomcom,"May 31, 2022",10/10,Without a doubt the best mystery film of all time. The story and development of this film is just awesome and the ending is definitely one of the best of all time. Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances maybe his best and Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are perfect too. I could watch it every day because it's just gorgeous. Definitely in my top 20 of all time!

NoArrow,"Jul 7, 2003",N/A,"""Se7en"" is a police drama about two cops trying to find a mysterious killer who is knocking off victims according to the sins they've committed.  The plot is intriguing, the acting is emotional, and the thrills are incredibly creepy.Though, this film wouldn't be as disturbing as some say it is.  Sure, the ending is sad, but aside from that, it's just as 'gross' as every other forensic movie.  In fact, movies like ""The Bone Collector"" are more disgusting than this.And, of course, there's Fincher's excellent directing talent.  The camera angles are cool, the chase scenes are suspenseful, and the investigation is clever.  Morgan Freeman plays the grizzled old cop well, and Pitt delivers a more comedic performance than a dramatic one as the young Det. Mills.The best part of ""Se7en"" would be Kevin Spacey's creepy role as the deadly killer.  Sure, Spacey looks like your regular nice guy, but that's what makes him so evil.  You hate him so much because you feel guilty for liking him.""Se7en"" is a funny, dramatic, thrill-ride of a movie, 8.5/10."
lesleyharris30,"Jul 15, 2016",10/10,"Se7en is an amazing movie with an incredibly well developed plot and a stunning cast. It had me glued to the screen for the entire run time, as we follow two detectives struggling to catch a serial killer who has been murdering people as a representation of the seven deadly sins, the images this killer makes the bodies in to are literally some of the most brutal things I have witnessed on film. David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker did a stellar job developing detectives Somerset and Mills, who Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring to life flawlessly, their relationship is a complicated one that becomes more layered as the film continues. However, the highlight was Kevin Spacey, who steals the show as the man we were waiting to see from the very beginning, and is not one bit disappointing, he is sinister, absurd and a straight up creep, he chilled me to the core, I do not think any other actor could have portrayed this psychopath better. Thrilling, engaging and incredibly well acted, I can not find a single flaw in Se7en, highly recommend to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller.Two detectives search for a serial killer who plans on taking seven victims as a way of exposing the deadly sins.Best Performance: Kevin Spacey"
SameirAli,"Dec 29, 2016",9/10,"David Fincher, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt; these 3 names are enough to make this movie a must watch for film lovers.Se7en is the story of a serial killer, who kills his victims for the seven deadly sins.

xAMERICANxPSYCHOx,"Nov 9, 2016",10/10,"What can one say that, I'm positive, hasn't already been said about this film? That taken into consideration, I will review this title regardless.Seven, from start to finish, is a film that ""Will Be Puzzled Over, Studied, and Followed... Forever."" That is a quote used in the movie to describe the crimes that ensue(d), but I feel it works quite well as a tag-line for the film itself. The Film is set in semi-modern New York and revolves around two characters - Detective David Mills & Detective William Somerset. (David being a transfer/""rookie"" and Somerset, the hardened veteran) The plot consists of Mills and Somerset trailing a serial killer by way of varying but distinct clues left at each scene. I personally believe that Seven lacks in no definitive aspect or area; it is (in my opinion) perfect in every way and a true classic that should be enjoyed by everyone - and I would be more than willing to debate this statement any time, any day. Breakthrough roles, more than incredible cinematography, plot line and supporting roles with awe- striking scenes, twists and developments at every turn."
shalkhty,"Apr 14, 2020",10/10,The situation where Brad Pitt the last few moment were really intense it makes you think about how the character of Pitt would have to go through while the decision he made finally was weirdly satisfying..
t4art,"Apr 7, 2022",9/10,"I consider this film to be a cradle and inspiration for every filmmaker who presents crime and mystery cinema.This is a film that should not be re-presented in any way, but I hope that there will be a new part for it and we will see after years what the investigators have reached and how they are facing crime in our time.The Seven Sins are still present among humans and the movie must present us with a new masterpiece with a new part and with the same weight."
preston_peace,"May 11, 2015",9/10,"I think the greatest strength of Se7en is its opening twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes makes you think that you're in for a decent, gritty, detective movie. But nothing worth the 250. It's sort of what Summerset and Mills thinks they're getting into. They think that this is going to be a hard case, but not scarring. They keep their heads high and don't think much of it. But after those twenty minutes, it becomes a tale of self worth, moral ambiguity, guilt and everything that'd usually be fluff in any other movie, turned into a disturbing look into what we can and have become as a species.The film is hard to write about because it does everything in a bad buddy cop movie and makes it realistic. How would Mel Gibson and Danny Glover function outside of the job? How would the world react to absurd James Bond like plans? How would a basically criminal master mind make his plans make sense? The film is like a satire that went all of the way. It makes everything that'd be nonsense in any other film, and I mean any other film, work. The dialogue works, the acting, the camera, the story, the plan, the makeup, everything works. And the best part is, you don't expect it to. By all means, this film should've been awful, and it's brilliant.This the first time I'm truly recommending a movie. Unlike a lot of good movies, this one you want to suggest to others. It's hard to recommend something like The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or Citizen Kane because of one reason or another. It's too long, some things don't make sense, but Se7en is a film that's enjoyable and for reasons that can't be explained. It's a watchable movie.The only problem is also the greatest strength. The first twenty minutes are a bit, well, ""slow"" because they're necessary and without it the film wouldn't work on an emotional or logical level. But, even then, it so much more watchable than a lot of other first twenty minutes. It's a ""good movie"" no matter what.If nothing else, everything about this film WORKS. What that means, I still don't know. But it's a working movie and make of that what you will. Please, watch this movie."
dionnevdnat,"Jun 12, 2012",8/10,"Are you afraid of the deathly sins? By Dionne van der Nat, Floris van Hoogdalem and Myrte TjoaThis review is about the film 'Seven', directed by David Fincher. The film is set in 1995, the year in which the movie was released. In which city the film is set, is unclear and unmentioned in the film. The two main characters, detectives Mills and Somerset are played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. It is a thriller which is very well directed and acted.The film se7en is about two detectives who try to solve a series of brute murders. Detective Summerset is retiring in seven days, the seven days relate to the title of the film and the seven murders committed. Mills, the young detective, is desperately willing to do a case on his own. Every murder committed relates to one of the deathly sins. When the two detectives discover after the second murder they are dealing with the seven deathly sins they know there are some more horrible murders about to happen. Summerset and Mills try and do their best to catch this guy, but are they able to stop him in time? We thought seven is a very good film and enjoyed watching it even more than once. The film is really catching and moving. While watching the film you have the feeling you are really in it and everything in the film is really happening around you, you can feel the terror and fear of the characters. Unlike other films you can relate seven to reality, without knowing everyone sometimes feels or acts like the deathly sins, what if you would be murdered if you did again...?Firstly, what makes this movie brilliant is that the acting is very convincing in Se7en. The character of William Somerset is brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman. His facial expressions, the way he talks and even his body language makes us believe in the character of William Somerset and he develops throughout the film. The connection between him and Brad Pitt is great and also shows us what a great actor Brad Pitt actually is. David Mills is the young gun in the movie, he is eager to learn and Pitt sells this really well. The two completely different detectives develop their 'bromance' throughout the film and you develop a form of sympathy towards the two. Another great acting performance is from Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Mils' wife. The young actress has to make David Mills feel comfortable in his new surrounding and she tries to do that, although she herself is very insecure. Paltrow might be one of the most important characters in the whole story.Secondly, the editing plays an important role in the movie. On the DVD version of the movie they show how and why they have sometimes edited the light and shots. When a scene with a negative mood is filmed, they edit the light in such a way that it is very dark at the set. When a scene with a positive atmosphere is filmed the set has been edited much lighter. The head-space of the actors has been chosen with care, e.g. in a serious scene they want to show the whole face of Morgan Freeman to show how serious he is and they also do this in the opposite way to create suspense. The use of the reverse shot is used quite often in this kind of movie, especially when there are interrogations. Se7en is not an exception, this technique also creates suspense, and you can clearly see the intentions of the one who talks. The average shot length in this movie is different per shot and this makes you think about it. The director has done this sometimes to create suspense, sometimes to make things clearer for the viewer. The use of parallel editing is not used that often in this movie, but when it is used, it is very effective and sometimes it shows a surprise.Thirdly, the use of camera-work is from big importance in the movie. The director sometimes does not show things to manipulate us into thinking nothing is there. The use of reverse shot has been discussed in the paragraph above and this is vital in the movie to show the emotions from the characters during conversations. The way we see the corpses for the first time in this movie is also very well done. The camera is moving very slowly and you will see the grossest thing first. This creates a form of disgust and sometimes leave you breathless. The close-ups are mainly to show that the characters are worried and you can see the desperate look in their eyes. The movement of the camera when the detectives are chasing someone makes you feel part of the action and is therefore used effectively. The angle of the camera is sometimes used to make one of the characters look heroic (low angle) or to make a character look weak and vulnerable. The low angle technique is effectively used when the detectives chase the serial killer and it stocks your breath at that point.We think this film was really well thought of and very well casted. Everything said in the film really makes you believe the serial killer could stand right behind you. The camera-work is very well done and the music well-chosen. The suspense keeps up throughout the entire film and at the end of the film we were breathless. We think this was a very good movie, and although is was made almost twenty years ago, the special effects are used effectively and the actors are believable. We really recommend watching this film!"
liviu_e2006,"Sep 20, 2015",N/A,"Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi"
TensersFloatingDisk,"Apr 15, 2004",2/10,"I'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film.  It doesn't.Let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem.Let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- Freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and Brad Pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, I'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly.  Gwyneth Paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and Spacey's character is...well, he's not a character.  He's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment?  That he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car?Let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them.What kind of police department is this?  There is not ONE ATTEMPT to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)?  Where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)?  Why aren't the cops even TRYING to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints?  Most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, EVER, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. When Spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. Rot in jail, sicko.""I suppose the success of ""Se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art.""  A sad comment on the state of the horror genre."
romanrock-48568,"Aug 9, 2023",10/10,"Se7en is an absolutely incredible movie in its genre, one of the best movies directed by David Fincher. The movie is about detectives who investigate crimes based on the 7 deadly sins.Let's go through all the points to adequately rate the movie:1) Plot - I give 1 point to the movie for its idea. The theme is quite off-the-beaten-path, especially in 1995. At that time, I'm sure, ""Se7en"" made a real sensation.The second point goes to the movie for the smooth development of the plot: from incident to incident the heroes get more and more buried in the investigation, and each next crime is tougher than the previous one. Dialogues are also worth mentioning: they are perfectly written, meaningful, and there is no sense of any naïveté.The third point is definitely for the logical ending. Nothing is broken - neither chronology, nor the original idea. The scenes ending the movie fit perfectly into the general plot and logically conclude it.2) Actors' performance - the actors have a psychological correspondence with the characters. The main actors played their roles admirably: Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt showed the highest skill. They are really unconditionally believed throughout the entire timeline. Kevin Spacey also coped with the role 100% - moderately calm and cold-blooded, moderately cunning, moderately painful. Also +1 point.One more, already the fifth point should be awarded to the movie for the stunning appearance of the characters. Each character corresponds to his clothes, behavior, atmosphere in the scene. As an example we can cite one character from the very beginning, this image is so memorable that it even found an echo in the music industry: German band Rammstein re-shot this scene for their Haifisch music video (2009).3) The music - not much can be said about this one. It is concise, keeps the tension at the right moments, and otherwise skillfully accompanies the awesome video. A well-deserved sixth score for the movie.4) Visuals - a lot has been said in the paragraph about the actors, and now we should mention their surroundings. All the sets, makeup, lighting, color correction - everything fits perfectly with what's going on. The movie is moderately dark, and this is to its advantage. The seventh point in the piggy bank.The camerawork is marvelous. The angles, framing, shooting of dynamic scenes are flawless. The editing does not strain, the frame does not shake, there is a clear understanding of what is happening. There are also a lot of incredibly atmospheric scenes in the movie. +1 again.5) The finale - oh, it's an absolute masterpiece. It is unpredictable, until the very beginning of the denouement the viewer has no idea what the antagonist's plan is. It shows a very emotionally powerful scene where the mind confronts the animal's anger and feelings. For the unobvious denouement I give the movie 2 points at once.10 out of 10Well deserved. Undoubtedly."
jdring2007,"Mar 23, 2022",10/10,"Let's start with the basics. Which, in this movie, aren't as simple as the term implies. There is mystery to be had, thrills to experience, chills down your spine, the wrinkling of your nose in disgust, the unease in your gut, and oh yes, even a handful of chuckles. Mostly thanks to the dark humor and sarcastic manner of Brad Pitt's character, while Morgan Freeman's is the much more solemn, except that one scene where he's laughing more than I've ever seen him laugh in any other movie. Their polar opposites help engage different parts of your brain, and emotions, as the movie progresses. It's a rollercoaster of sorts, but mostly stays in the ballpark of disturbing this after disturbing that, yet all the while you're immersed in the bleak atmosphere, you're simultaneously glued to the screen. The score is haunting, the cinematography just - I don't know the word, I just love it - and the performances superb from one character to the other. Aside from the main two stars, all the supporting roles throughout execute so naturally that half the time it feels like a sordid documentary. Then of course there's Kevin Spacey, in a notorious role that was a shocker to people watching it for the first time. Given that I only write spoilerless reviews, I won't touch on the details of what I consider one of if not my favorite movie ending of all time. Back to the beginning, I love that the movie opens with a scene, and then runs the credit sequence, which is unnervingly perfect in itself, and from there the movie proceeds. Sure, it has some slow moments, but to be expected, and ultimately I am still too enrapt to have any of that detract from my rating. Even though the movie strictly follows the detective side of things versus the actual murders, the riddles and intrigue suffice to keep you far from bored."
isaiahwilson15,"May 2, 2016",9/10,"Se7evn once again proves David Fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. Major credit also goes to Andrew Kevin Walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. The progression of Se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. The movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. The constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as Detectives Somerset and Mills. The progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. The introduction of Tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. Se7en's villain John Doe is what ultimately makes this movie. The brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. The scene where Mill and Somerset question Doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. Doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. The creep factor of Se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. It's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. However, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. Top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time."

Finntroll,"Aug 2, 2004",N/A,"David Fincher's breakthrough Se7en is one of few movies that deserves to be called a masterpiece. An incredibly dark movie (for mainstream that is) about cruelty and human depravity that hooks it's fangs into the viewers spine like a bloodthirsty beast and won't let go even after the movie's over. This is both very wellplayed and wellcrafted. Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all do top-notch performances, the script is one of the strongest in years and the ending must be on of the best I've seen. It's strange that a movie that doesn't rely on shock effects can be this shocking. After I saw this I was amazed by the pure cleverness of it all and the way I felt. The depressing mood of it all is just perfect and it works wonderfully as a foundation on which this movie lies. Go see it now.10/10"

neerajmenons,"Jun 30, 2024",10/10,"David Fincher's ""Se7en"" is a grim, unrelenting journey into the darkest corners of human nature and morality. From its haunting opening credits to its shocking and unforgettable climax, this film remains a benchmark in the thriller genre.The story follows two detectives, the seasoned William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the brash rookie David Mills (Brad Pitt), as they hunt down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi. Freeman and Pitt deliver powerful performances, their contrasting approaches to justice and life providing a rich, emotional core to the narrative. Freeman's portrayal of Somerset's world-weariness is a masterclass in subtlety, while Pitt's raw intensity captures Mills' youthful fervor and desperation.Kevin Spacey's chilling portrayal of John Doe, the methodical and philosophical killer, is one of the most compelling antagonists in cinema history. His calm demeanor and twisted rationale make for a deeply unsettling character that lingers long after the credits roll.Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay is tight and meticulously crafted, each sin-related murder scene more gruesome and thought-provoking than the last. The dialogue is sharp, often poignant, and imbued with a sense of impending doom.The film's cinematography, by Darius Khondji, is visually arresting, utilizing a desaturated palette to emphasize the bleakness of the urban landscape. The relentless rain and perpetual gloom heighten the sense of decay and hopelessness that permeates the film. Howard Shore's haunting score further amplifies the film's eerie atmosphere, blending seamlessly with the visual elements to create an immersive experience.""Se7en"" is more than just a crime thriller; it's a profound exploration of human depravity and the complex nature of justice. The film poses difficult questions about the nature of sin and punishment, forcing the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about society and themselves.The climax of ""Se7en"" is one of the most shocking and powerful in film history. It is a testament to Fincher's directorial prowess that the tension remains palpable, the revelation both horrifying and inevitable. The final moments are seared into the viewer's mind, leaving an indelible mark that sparks reflection and discussion.In conclusion, ""Se7en"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that excels in every aspect of storytelling, performance, and technical execution. It's a dark, disturbing, and unforgettable journey that stands the test of time. If you haven't seen it, prepare yourself for a relentless and thought-provoking experience that will stay with you long after the screen goes dark."
MysticSolver,"Jun 2, 2024",8/10,"The main actors of the film deliver hard on this one, bringing the stakes to another level and making the movie quite thrilling to watch, even when I have seen it multiple times.The movie of course is very dark, but considering when this was made, I can appreciate that because it must've been a very risky choice at the time when cinema was overall a more positive environment when it comes to the themes and imagery of film. This film won't hold back on its grittiness, but also doesn't show you stuff just out of the need to be dark, and that I also appreciate quite a bit with shows like The Boys around which do the polar opposite. Dark for the sake of being dark is never an appealing thing for me, and never will.So much has already been said about the movie that I'll end my review here, movie is solid 8/10."
m-burakyuksel-564-438070,"May 17, 2020",10/10,"When I first saw the movie, I was too young to understand the movie. Many years later, I re-watched the film. It's really a much better production than any other film that's been made in those years. Morgan Freeman once again plays an old retired citizen. Ever since I was born, he's always been old."
braddugg,"Sep 8, 2016",10/10,"Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.Engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. David Fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. His first film Alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. Then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well.The dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. It's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. The action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. The culmination or finale is a shocker. To say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling.The nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. In the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. Yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time I see this film thus, I call it as action-packed. I must say, I have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time I like it more. So this film just keeps growing on me.The cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. These two departments technically are supreme. Other departments did their job well too. Of all, it's the direction that mattered. Fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was ""The Fight Club"" which is a cult in itself.It's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. I have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does."
DVR_Brale,"Sep 7, 2016",7/10,"Why is Se7en so good? Well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than David Fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. Other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt and one I won't mention because Fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. How can you not like Freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to Pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)?Do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? Of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. He thinks that the world is better without them. Theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from God. As a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. If one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask God for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. This serial killer is not merciful. He positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. Since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. He had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel.After this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). As I mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. Together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. This is important when you consider the ending. Everybody knows Se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being Requiem For a Dream). Since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of Se7en. This movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. That's at least what I think.So why did I give Se7en a symbolic seven? I don't have any particular reason. Se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. Apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. It's predictable as well, but it seems to me that Fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. We know what is going to happen and that gives us more ""space"" to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. Soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. Se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better.So to conclude: Se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. Underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. Those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should I say seven."

Macleanie,"Jun 19, 2019",10/10,"An incredibly dark and noir thriller by David Fincher. It stars three of hollywood's best in what is a twisted mystery with some classicly memorable scenes. Right from the off, this movie sets a tone which it continues throughout with such strong performances. This is one of my all time favourite movies."
caitlinmalone,"Sep 21, 2016",8/10,"David Fincher reveals a masterpiece of a movie in his film Seven. The movie follows the process of two detectives, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) as they attempt to track down a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is choosing his methods and victims based off of the seven deadly sins. The film is high quality for two main reasons: its complex characters and its moral commentary.The most intriguing character is easily John Doe, the killer. Rather than creating a stereotypical mindless killer, Fincher makes Doe a serious, soft-spoken man, whose power comes from his brain rather than his brawn. Doe is extremely logical and methodical in his approaches, as his killings require intense planning. His character poses as a striking contrast to Mills. Although he is the ""good guy""-the cop, the detective, the one trying to stop a killer- Mills is not likable. Unlike Doe, he raves and constantly shows frustration, and often reverts to physical violence to try to accomplish his mission. Although the watcher probably will still root for Mills, when Doe speaks, they will be more apt to listen. Somerset serves as the voice of reason, reeling in Mills when necessary and respecting Doe's genius as he tries to catch him.These characters, especially John Doe, perfectly display the film's social commentary on the seven deadly sins within our culture. More importantly, they raise the moral question of what is evil, and what is good. There is a clear clash between good and evil within the film, but the reason it is so successful is that it makes the audience ask themselves questions. Are evil people able to be victims? Is society harming the killer or did the killer harm society? What is a just price to pay for evil doings? Therefore, I highly recommend Seven to anyone who is not too squeamish and who enjoys a perplexing film that will leave you thinking. I enthusiastically endorse this film with an ""A""."
davidburrows89,"Sep 22, 2013",10/10,"IMO this is David Finchers best film. Fight Club was good. The Game was interesting, but this overshadows them all.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives who are after a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O.Brad Pitt actually acts in this film, Morgan Freeman is awesome as always, but Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen.This film had me gripped from start to finish, however it is the last 30 minutes of the film that made this so special. Never before or since I watched this film have I ever been so engrossed in a film than I was in the last 30 minutes of Se7en.10/10. Superb."
MrBoMzIMDb,"Sep 7, 2025",7/10,"David Fincher's Se7en (1995) is often celebrated as one of the darkest and most influential crime thrillers of its era. Its premise-a pair of detectives tracking a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his method-is undeniably compelling, and its grim atmosphere left a lasting mark on the genre. Yet, revisiting it as part of a younger generation, the film does not strike with the same impact it once had.On a technical level, Se7en is expertly crafted. Fincher's direction, paired with Darius Khondji's shadow-drenched cinematography, creates a claustrophobic urban landscape that feels both timeless and suffocating. The rain-soaked streets, decaying apartments, and oppressive gloom perfectly mirror the bleakness of the narrative. The performances are also strong: Morgan Freeman brings measured wisdom as Detective Somerset, while Brad Pitt's impulsive Detective Mills contrasts with youthful energy and recklessness. Kevin Spacey, though appearing late, delivers chilling restraint as John Doe.Where the film falters for modern audiences is in its pacing and predictability. What once felt groundbreaking now feels familiar, as countless thrillers and TV shows have borrowed from its formula. The infamous ending, though still shocking, no longer carries the same weight after years of cultural references and parodies. Moreover, while the atmosphere is meticulously built, the character development outside the central trio is limited, making the film feel narrower than its ambitions suggest.Se7en remains an important milestone in crime cinema, but for viewers encountering it today, its impact is somewhat muted compared to its reputation.Summary: Dark, stylish, and influential, Se7en is a strong thriller, though for newer audiences it may not feel as groundbreaking as critics suggest.Rating: 7/10."

BenjaminPopkin,"Mar 30, 2022",9/10,"Se7en is a 1995 Crime/Thriller directed by David Fincher that stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two homicide detectives on the hunt for a serial killer who is committing various dark and gruesome crimes based on the Seven Deadly Sins. This movie is very well filmed and tells a haunting yet realistic story. In the sense that there could be a serial killer who does things like this in real life, because nothing is too extraordinary in the film to the point where it's not possible; so, that's what makes the brutality of the crimes so impactful and horrific.The film has great direction by Fincher. The movie does a good job at keeping you interested throughout. It is written well and Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman really bounced off one another. I was surprised with their chemistry on screen because I have never seen them together like this in a film before.The films aesthetic throughout the runtime is dark, gritty and filled with dread through the use of production design, composition, color and cinematography. The colors in the film were always murky. Stylistically the film is beautiful in a sick way with how Fincher manipulates what's on the screen and how it's on the screen. Although, there were times in the movie where I didn't even want to look at the screen, but there were also times where Fincher doesn't even need to show us and we still know something horrifc is on the other side by the way it is suggested through the mise-en-scene. (The Lust sin in particular). There is a clear vision that is being executed. However, the focus is not all on the violence, but on the setting and the people as well. The characters all have depth and they feel like real people that we have to spend time with. The scene with Pitt, Paltrow, and Freeman having dinner together is an example of one of these scenes we get that are character driven. The setting is constantly shown off through the mise-en-scene.Overall, I thought Se7en was an amazing movie. I thought it was written well. There were some great dialogue scenes in the middle of the movie as well as the end. The end was really good one of the best parts of the whole movie. The entire third act is pretty insane to be honest. It was very well written and executed; totally had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The cinematography, writing, acting, and direction were all very well done. The film was disturbing and gritty yet in a way very real which makes it all the more shocking and the climax is one of the best I have seen in a while. I really liked it and I recommend checking it out especially if you're into darker movies."
danrutnut,"Jun 16, 2017",10/10,"I saw this film in an empty cinema with a mate and I came out with chills, Kevin spacey plays his role amazingly same as Morgan freeman and Brad Pitt and could watch this film over and over and it would never get boring! The effects are also amazing the tone of the films is bleak at times but I like that in films so this one is definitely highly recommend!"
PredragReviews,"Jun 13, 2016",9/10,"Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe (Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending. ""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film. One of the most haunting ironies I find in Walker's script well portrayed by Fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between John Doe, the antagonist and Somerset, the protagonist. If you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that Somerset agrees with Doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify Doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings. With Doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, Somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallel that exists between the two characters. Yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while Somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, Doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer. The film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller: mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
TheAll-SeeingI,"May 22, 2019",10/10,"Put your goblins and monster films away: This one's based on the horrors humans commit, and therefore hits home in a real-life way.The performances are incredible.

Meaningful movie,Although the story isn't original, it's powerfully directed by David Fincher, The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. As a narrative, the film is quite involving.The Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances. Decent film making, universal subject, overall good performance, David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in American film history, far more interesting, handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analyses and briefly glimpsed post Morten shots, but never showing the murderous acts themselves."

While the whopper of an ending has stuck with me, I recalled little else other than that I wasn't super impressed by this back then and I think a lot of that had to do with my then not very high opinion of Brad Pitt. It's a well made, unusual, sometimes gruesome serial killer crime story about with a solid performance from Morgan Freeman. I always had a problem with Pitt when he was young in that I didn't think he was all that great of an actor. I still have some issues with him here, but he's better than I remembered and has some moments that are interesting. This was a big year for Kevin Spacey with this and The Usual Suspects, but it's hard to look at him now in this creepy role that he plays so perfectly. Seems a lot of people on here love this good movie."
john in missouri,"Jan 27, 2006",N/A,"Maybe I've just seen too many movies. Maybe my expectations were too high, having seen this movie highly praised here. Maybe the story seemed a bit too predictable to me. Maybe I just found some of the gore a bit over the top. Or maybe I've seen so much gore in films already that I simply wasn't that impressed.Whatever it was, this movie struck me as okay, certainly not bad, but not the masterpiece others have praised it as. Interestingly, I've seen most of the main characters in movies that I liked better: Kevin Spacey appeared in The Usual Suspects; Brad Pitt in Twelve Monkeys (although he also did a fine job here); and Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy and The Shawshank Redemption."
chera_khalid,"Sep 9, 2023",9/10,"Sure! ""Se7en"" is an intense and gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. With its dark and atmospheric setting, the movie creates a sense of unease that lingers throughout. The performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are outstanding, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. The plot is cleverly crafted, taking you on a twisted journey as the detectives hunt down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders. The cinematography and direction are top-notch, adding to the overall suspense and tension. While the movie is undoubtedly disturbing at times, it's also thought-provoking and leaves a lasting impact. I highly recommend ""Se7en"" for its thrilling storyline, strong performances, and its ability to keep you guessing until the very end. It's definitely a must-watch for fans of crime thrillers. 9/10!"
lastliberal,"Oct 10, 2008",9/10,"There is no one who could argue against the fact that if you put Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey together in a film, it is going to be a hit.I have watched countless hours of murder mysteries in movies and TV and have read innumerable books, and there is no finer murder/serial killer story than this one.It has every element that one would look for in this type of story and it delivers with a punch to the gut that is visceral and lasting.This is one of those films that you can watch countless times and never tire of."
SpelingError,"Aug 30, 2015",8/10,"This is one of the most horrifying movies ever made. But it doesn't just consist of violence. It has amazing performances, tense scenes, and a nail-biting finale which you won't ever forget for a very long time.2 detectives try to hunt down a psychopath as he kills people in grotesque ways based around the seven deadly sins.This movie contains several memorable scenes which have the tendency to knock you off guard. Besides the ending, another amazing scene is when they investigate the sloth victim. The gore is amazing but we get the jumpscare of our lives in it. I'm not going to spoil it though because otherwise I'll ruin it. Many people will agree that the ending is the best part by far. It is tense and suspenseful and it is completely unpredictable. It is one of the most memorable movie endings by far.Also, the acting is amazing also. In my opinion, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt both give one of their best performances yet. Morgan Freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in The Shawshank Redemption.The acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. Fincher probably looked at previous works of Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off.As much I want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which I felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. There weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though. However, I do think that this would've been a masterpiece if it weren't for those few scenes.Nobody thought much of Fincher when he directed Alien 3 and he was originally dismissed as just another style over substance director. However, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. Since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially Fight Club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today.In conclusion, Se7en is a near perfect movie. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it contains one of the best finales to a movie ever. I understand why some people disliked this movie but none of the reasons affect my opinion of this movie and I think that it is a must-watch for everyone as long as you don't mind realistic violence and gore."
TheSilentBlur,"Jul 4, 2016",10/10,"The 7 Deadly Sins: Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy. Wrath. Pride. Lust.""Se7en"" is definitely a movie no one will forget after watching it. The story follows two detectives: Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) tracking down a serial killer who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. Seriously, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the first time watching it. I was too young to see the movie when it came out in 1995, but I managed to watch this on DVD just recently. This movie is told from the point of view from the detectives, trying to find the motives and reasons why the killer is taking out random victims. We see them in a frustrated situation (Brad Pitt's character is a fine example of this along with his F bomb dialogue).The performances from the cast are superb. The majority of the film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's chemistry - how their relationship builds up as the two are desperately trying to solve the case. Gwyneth Paltrow is placed third in the top billing as Detective Mill's wife - a woman who loves her husband but has a dislike for living in the terrible city they live in. Her performance sells, but I feel she did not have enough screen time.There is one other actor's performance I really want to talk about. But I can't. You'll have to see the movie for yourself and you'll know who I am referring to.The movie never fails to lose your interest. You are invested in these characters solving a murder mystery that is (to them) not common, yet very disturbing. Each kill has been done off screen, and we are left to our imagination of how each murder went down. What we don't see is much more effective than if we do see...And I believe director David Fincher has done a great job at this. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout, and it's executed unexpectedly which works for this kind of film.""Se7en"" was a movie ahead of its time. I can't imagine what would it be like had the film been made in let's say 1989-90. Definitely recommend this thriller if you're into surprises. Even on repeated viewings it's still a thrill to watch and look out for things you may have missed in the first time viewing."
evancartin,"Jun 21, 2023",10/10,"This film truly haunts with its darkness. The crime at the end of the movie is shocking and full of chaos. I couldn't have guessed that the villain would do something so wicked. The ending is truly haunting, but that's what makes it intriguing. This film is the true definition of a thriller. Se7en doesn't play around with excessive philosophy, but instead presents extreme and terrifying nihilism. Director David Fincher successfully creates a terrifying atmosphere that surpasses the supernatural. It's a horrifying nightmare of terror, and its mystery holds the audience until the end. Despite being incredibly frightening, this film shows no mercy for a cruel world. I don't support nihilism in this film, but I see it as an extraordinary work. Without Fincher's chilling touch, this film wouldn't succeed. The screenplay writer is also remarkable, as they manage to present morally unsettling questions from beginning to end. It is relevant to the horrifying real world."
jackthepgl,"Aug 9, 2023",9/10,"Here I go on my mission to find the seven deadly sins in this David Fincher mystery crime thriller, Se7en. It focuses on dark and brutal themes of mystery and horror and it has that very evocative story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat whilst Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are witnessing the horrors of the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Whoever uses those sins as motives in murders is John Doe and he cut his own fingertips so that the police and two detectives, David Mills and William Somerset won't know who killed these victims but Mills and Somerset do know it's John Doe who committed these horrible crimes. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry together on-screen to have the mystery to solve the seven deadly sins in this creepy cruel world where sins and crimes are committed including in bad weather 'cause the filmmakers wanted to make the atmosphere look gritty and dark. David Fincher has his reputation for making his films and cinematography look gritty, brutal and dark as I said in his previous films. The twist at the end is brutal, it's amazing. The box has something inside and Mills know that someone's head is inside and he says that one line that everyone knows about is ""What's in the box?"" and he has the great chase scene between him and Doe. Both of these scenes are suspenceful. I love Se7en and Se7en is an brutal and dark edge of the seat neo-noir crime thriller that will keep you invested for some mystery and thrills by David Fincher. There is another films that stars Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher is Fight Club and I am interested in checking it out because of David Fincher's directing style and cinematography. If anybody hasn't seen Se7en, I would recommend you go watch it and if anybody who hates the film, they are totally sinned. I know that's just a catchphrase but that's just the way it is for people who hated Se7en."
arashrastan,"Apr 22, 2017",7/10,I really liked the movie's direction and atmosphere. Acting was great. Characters were real with sufficient motives. Cinematography was perfect. Over all was a good work of art in many aspects of filmmaking. The film's score helped to create the tone of the film. Very good camera work and Art direction was very good. I will give This movie A.
onerslnt1,"Feb 24, 2011",1/10,"I always take the trouble to write an IMDb review when I think a movie is too horrible to watch - the good ones, I am sure people can find them without me.This movie is rotten to the core. It does not entertain a sensible mind. It does not uplift. It has not humor, no fun, no moral. It is morbid, depressing, meaningless. But it is not meaningless like, say, life. Life's meaninglessness has a depth, it is somber. The meaninglessness of this movie is like a small child killing a white rabbit - wanton, senseless, rabid.What did you learn from this movie? What did you enjoy? What moved you? Nothing unless you admire gore and violence per se. Yes, the acting, especially of KS, was superb. But I do not see any glamor in superbly acting the part of a mad killer. The mad killer can do it himself.Anyways, I am rambling; but after a movie like this, you are at a loss for words. You wonder what kind of people spend a million dollar on a movie like this. You wonder what kind of people go to watch it. You wonder, most of all, how someone can enjoy spending money on this rather than giving some money to, whoever."
motezart,"Dec 31, 2013",10/10,"If Fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. This is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. And this remains Fincher's best film.Two cops in New York are hunting a serial killer. The presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through Kevin Spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm.Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. Walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. Apparently he was quite depressed at the time. New Line Cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production Walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. It was released Sept 22, 1995. By using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killer's prerogative, the film's plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but Seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best Thrillers of all time because of Fincher's vision of a hellish New York. This world is poison and Fincher makes it seep.The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this film's beauty is in the compilation. The sets and lighting are so complex that making Seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. It is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes Se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement.More at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"
costasachin,"Sep 1, 2012",10/10,"If you will see this movie the first thing will come into your mind will be""Oh my god"". This is a tale of a serial killer and let me tell you this one is quite different from other you seen. This guy (kevins.) is looking so intense in the movie. Though the story seems fit to the characters but the creepiness of the main idea is very unique....!! And like always brad pit is looking handsome and morgen is intelligent but kevin is a winner in this movie. when i saw this movie last night i wasn't thinking that it will be so intense like its review says on IMDb but just after watching it for 30 min. it gripped me in such a ways which words can not define. this is movie which you will remember for a lifetime and discuss with 1000 people and everyone will have the different theory for the characters but i bet on that - everybody will be agree on the idea and the intensity of the movie. A must watch if you like the serial killer movie and light blood n gore but i bet the idea will more hit you then this. I am giving it 10/10!! Best in its category."

diegoalcivar,"Apr 15, 2020",10/10,Maybe one of the best movies of the 90's. The work done by Fincher and Khondji and the atmosphere they created is just outstanding.
dudov-61967,"Jan 22, 2020",10/10,This movie is so disturbing and that's why I absolutely adore it
Duncan07,"Aug 24, 2023",7/10,I really liked it suprisingly. Seeing it is not the type of genre I would normally watch and that I generally like but this film was really well done. It has a gripping and interesting storyline. I think the whole plot around the seven capital sins was really ingenious and made the story great. I love the beautiful dark cinematography and the screenplay is really intelligent. To add on top of that great performances from Morgan Freeman playing the detective and Brad Pitt as Mills. I also like how the film talks about a lot of murders but really not much is shown. Overall a disturbing yet really good film.
ahunt,"Dec 21, 2001",N/A,"Morbidly intriguing, disgustingly fascinating.  I was deeply shaken by what I would call ""my favourite film"".Forget Brad Pitt, I found Morgan Freeman's acting amazing.  He is calm cool and collected throughout the whole film.  A complete stoic.Some good jazz tunes are part of the soundtrack and the film has style.Watch carefully, the ""lust"" scene.  I didn't understand what had specifically happened, the first time that I saw it.I would like to compare the film with the psychological personality inventory called the Enneagram.  ""Ennea"" is Armenian for 9ine and I guess gram means...chart?  It is based on 9ine different personalities which, according to some sources corresponds to the se7en deadly sins + 2wo more.1ne = wrath2wo = pridethr3e = deceit4our = envyfi5e = greed6ix = fearse7en = gluttonyei8ht = lust9ine = slothThere is a theory about the enneagram (which I don't agree with) that states that a person will transform from 1ne personality to another in a particular order to become more psychologically healthy as a ""whole"" person.  The order is this:se7en: becomes fi5efi5e: becomes ei8htei8ht: becomes 2wo2wo: becomes 4our4our: becomes 1ne who becomes se7en to complete the cycleThis is the same order that the ""sins"" are mentioned throughout the film. It's basically the same order as above.se7en gluttony is mentioned firstfi5e greed is mentioned secondei8ht lust is mentioned.  9ine sloth is mentioned, which is next door to ei8ht and breaks the cycle in half2wo pride is mentioned4our envy is mentioned1ne wrath is mentioned.In both cases The order is 7-5-8-2-4-1.  I was obsessed by this fact in 1995 when the film came out because I was studying the enneagram at the time.  Obviously, someone needed a life :)"
MarieGabrielle,"Oct 19, 2007",10/10,"This film has many indelible moments, an amazing cast: Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is impressive and real. The Charlie Parker soundtrack with the blues sung by Billie Holiday ""I Cover the Waterfront"" captures the dark mood and underlying violence which exists in the city. Being from New York, the street scenes at night are 100% accurate, executives, harried workers, hookers and dealers all intermingle in a pastiche of chaos.We see the early scene where Freeman first meets novice detective David Mills (well portrayed by Brad Pitt) and he asks him what NYC homicide is like, and won't agent Somerset regret retiring? Freeman answers tiredly ...""I am moving....anyplace...far away from here""...Sloth, Greed, Lust, Pride, Envy, Gluttony, the seven deadly sins as proclaimed since Medieval era. Each murder is precisely carried out. John Doe is creating his masterpiece, an artwork of perfect murder. Kevin Spacey is superb as John Doe. His presence and diction are cutting and menacing. I would love to see him in more of these roles. The quote from Morgan Freeman at the end of it all resounds true: it is the quote from Hemingway. The theme is ""ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee""....Everyone is affected by violence. Best thriller and suspense, other than Hitchcock. Kudos to David Fincher and the cast The screenplay is amazing, I have bought that as well as the DVD. Highly recommended. 10/10."
alexanderliljefors,"Oct 6, 2024",8/10,"Its a real surprise that i havent seen this yet, its a movie that ive have heard so much about and i just simply thought ive watched it before.But when i decided to watch it it hit me that i didnt recall seeing it.Being on Imdb too 250 all time and having a bery high rating i was really intrigued to see how this was gonna turn out. The plot is really interesting and really fits the dark mystery/crime/thriller genre.First of all the acting is phenomenal and outstanding especially from Morgan Freeman, which always makes world class performances! A extremely intelligent film!Pitt and Freeman creates a really well dynamic!Storytelling is amazing!The directing, the soundtrack and filming is really good aswell!I really recommend this one! Its a film you have to watch!"
rish1603,"Dec 29, 2012",9/10,"As a 15 year old, I did not know what to expect from the movie. All I knew is that it was supposedly good and that the actors were the best there are. The storyline takes the viewer on a journey along with the characters. The viewer soon begins to empathise with Brad Pitt's seemingly over- confident character. This is similar for Morgan Freeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be significant towards the end of the movie. This movie is no murder mystery like any other, and perhaps not much of a murder mystery at all. This is due to the difficulty that the detectives have when attempting to solve the case. With any other actors, the movie may have been unbearable as it is often slow paced. However the acting was so real and, well, brilliant that you can't take your eyes off the screen for one second. All in all, the magnificent, unpredictable storyline combined with brilliant acting makes this movie a must- watch for all fans of film."
reefosj,"Dec 2, 2021",9/10,"Not one for watching these movies due to the stomach turning it causes me, but then I started to realise that's what makes this movie so captivating. Not all of the terrifying scenes were visual, a couple depended on your own imagination, scary to think about but it really pulled me into the film, I felt more and more horrified as the movie continued. You can expect quality art from these actors and the direction from the writing/ producer is top notch. Horrifying with a satisfying ending. Great film."
timothyhilditch,"Jan 12, 2022",8/10,"A young detective transfers to the city to replace the aging detective who is on his final week. Strange homicides start coming in which they have to investigate. A detective thriller which doesn't follow the usual story beats. You fall into the twists and turns as you learn about the seven deadly sins, ultimately I think this movie is about pride. Brilliant performance by the killer and excellence writing throughout. It really leaves you at the end to think."
ColonelArthur,"Dec 14, 2024",10/10,"Se7en is, without a doubt, the best film in its genre. It hooks you from the very beginning and doesn't let go. The performances are incredible. Morgan Freeman brings a calm and wise presence to his role, while Brad Pitt captures the emotional intensity and frustration of his character perfectly. Kevin Spacey is haunting in his role and really leaves an impression long after the film ends.While Law Abiding Citizen shares some themes with Se7en, this film takes things to another level, especially with its unforgettable ending. It's not just a twist-it forces you to think about human nature, morality, and the harshness of the world we live in. It's an ending that leaves you speechless and questioning everything.What I love most about Se7en is its simplicity. Unlike a lot of other detective movies that get too complicated or hard to follow, Se7en keeps things clear, yet never loses its depth. It feels like it's always building towards something bigger-something philosophical. The movie really makes you think: What is justice? How far should we go in trying to right wrongs? And how do we keep our humanity in a world full of pain and corruption?Se7en isn't just a great thriller-it's a movie that makes you reflect on life and the darkness that exists in the world. It's an experience that sticks with you. Even if you're not usually into crime dramas, this one is a must-see. A perfect 10/10."
firefalcoln,"Aug 18, 2016",7/10,"First off let me say that the direction and acting is very good. I don't recall having any major complaints and can't recall many minor complaints. To me this film just didn't have a 10 out of 10 script which is why I give it 8 stars. For me, the story is the most important part of just about every film. This movie's story was very good for the most part. However I had 2 big complaints. 1: for the first murder, they mention receipts for the food he bought. They mention that there was food bought twice the same day. Why didn't the cops investigate the store on the receipt and see if there was any video footage from either/both purchases? 2: I was able to predict the end right before it happened, which really is less than ideal when it was clearly meant to be a shock. I might have ranked the film higher if I hadn't just watched: Witness for the Prosecution. And that film pulls off the surprise ending better and more dramatically than just about any other film. So I had a high bar of expectation prior to seeing the film and I had really high hopes for 7, seeing how it has an 8.6 ranking. I think following my viewing i won't leave as a fan or hater of the film. I managed to see a lot of impressive components in the piece, and it's still well worth a viewing if you can handle the disturbing content. And maybe I was a rare case in predicting the end."
uds3,"Dec 13, 2004",N/A,"There is no doubt ""Seven"" is a superior film in every way, so far as crime dramas/psychological dramas go, Fincher is indeed a visionary director. This film however has achieved an unrealistic and totally unsupportable ""aura"" of brilliance that is simply unjustified. Having seen it now five times, the latest last night after my son bought it for my birthday, I have to declare it to be as boring and pretentious as the first night I saw it.Without anything but praise for everyone's performance (Spacey, especially) I still have nothing but blank indifference to every character presented here. What in Zeus' butthole was the point of the film? Any half competent lawyer would have gotten Pitt a suspended sentence (justifiable homicide...temporary insanity..whatever) Who cares what the hell Freeman decided to do...hang around a few more years, go shoot a few chickens? As for Ms Paltrow - the most boring and one-dimensional actress yet paraded on the silver screen (though Nicole Kidman isn't far behind)...HER fate was the highlight of the movie.Shamelessly exploitive crap though it was, I found RESURRECTION (A ""Seven"" clone) way more interesting and given that starred Mr ""Wooden"" himself (Christopher Lambert)....maybe I need therapy.Quite frankly for all its social comment, upmarket direction, cinematography and set-design, I think ""Seven"" is a modern ""Kings New Clothes."" Great film....shame about the entertainment factor. ANY film that feels like you've just donated four hours of your life has at its core, a problem.As for those who even MENTION this in the same breath as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - you HAVE to be kidding! That sequence between Hannibal and Starling during their first meeting alone, blows everything this film has to offer out the window."
il primo,"Apr 8, 2001",1/10,"Wow. There are a lot of bad films out there, but even with the worst of the worst there is some redeeming quality, like that neato big wave in the Perfect Storm. But Se7en? The acting is flat (Brad Pitt's opening lines seem like they're coming from someone acting for the first time, his moaning at the end, when he gets his special gift, just seemed pathetic); the script is not at all inventive and unsuccessfully covered up by hyperbolic special effects and redundant gore. The ""twist"" at the end is hardly disturbing because the writer/ director have been shoving gimmicky horror effects down the our throats for the entire movie.People who like this film- the dark, urban atmosphere, the pseudo-noir elements: please watch some David Lynch films and see how this should be created, i.e. not by using video game titles, not by relying heavily on special effects, make-up, and yet ANOTHER plot with biblical references, but instead by a careful selection of actors, beautiful cinematography, and incredibly original stories.Stop funding this director so that he will go back to making TV commercials instead of two hour long theater commercials."
snoducky,"Jul 3, 2024",10/10,"A dark, gloomy and hideous masterpiece.From start to finish this movie grips you tight and doesn't ever let go. The storytelling is perfected with the narration extending throughout the whole film. The film creates a chilling and disturbing atmosphere perfect for the plot of the film. The acting carries this film to what it is, it's shuttle but realistic and manic. The movie shows the perspective of a maniac , how he thinks, believes and acts and how hard it is to fully understand what's going on in their head. It also shows the downsides of our world, how it is and how there truly is a sin on every street corner."
haydenbate-95920,"Mar 18, 2022",8/10,"Seven is a crime, thriller following a rookie and a hardened, retiring detective as they try and solve the case of the mysterious murders, one per day for Seven days, finding that the victims also follow a pattern, they all represent one aspect of the seven deadly sins. The duo must find this killer before he finishes his grand masterpiece.I love this movie, the grimy and dark atmosphere, almost rustic in nature. Beauty in imperfection. David Fincher is a masterful director, choosing to rely on the weight of the scene, allowing it to hold, over fast cuts and fancy camera movements. The movie hooks you in most with it's disturbing nature, everything is so graphic and or disturbing in context. Right there, seeing what the detectives sees, trying to solve this puzzle with them.But outside of that, the story is simple yet deals with complex ideas, while also keeping it in a 2 hour runtime, which is impressive, knowing how long it needs to be and not over staying it's welcome.The only real issue i had with the movie is that i didn't feel that much of a connection as much as i should have to the story, until John Doe finally comes into the picture. From there, the movie is tense and had me hooked the entire time, the building music and the overall feeling that the characters are not in control. This is Fincher's true start into cinema. Though i prefer fight club and zodiac, this is by far his best original project."
eman063,"Jun 14, 2017",10/10,"This is just an all around great movie. Great acting, original story line. They don't make them like they used to. A good movie I hope they never try to re make. Some movies just need to left the way they are. A Great villain role in this movie and the hero's are both perfect in their roles. A must see"
saytosandeep,"Apr 16, 2014",8/10,"Se7en. An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!"
steiner-sam,"Sep 20, 2023",9/10,"It's a psychological crime drama set in the 1990s in a large American city. It follows two detectives tracking a serial killer basing his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins.William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is an older, unmarried African-American homicide detective one week from retirement. He is thoughtful and highly educated, with a clear religious base. His replacement and partner for a week of overlap is David Mills (Brad Pitt). Mills is a young, impulsive high school graduate with limited literary interests. He and his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), have just moved to the city from ""upstate,"" where Mills previously served as a detective. Tracy is less than enthusiastic about the move.Somerset's and Mills' first case is a bound, obese man found at his kitchen table. Then, a prominent lawyer lawyer dies. At the crime scenes are the words ""gluttony"" and ""greed."" The two detectives realize they're pursuing a serial killer and, at one point, almost catch him. Later, the highly literary John Doe (Kevin Spacey) reveals himself and offers to lead the detectives to two more bodies. There is a horrendous ending.""Se7en"" sifts through the life views of both Somerset and Mills and their struggle to analyze the killer's motivations. Freeman and Pitt pull wonderful characters from an excellent script. Though there is one memorable chase scene, their dialogue is much more important than the action. Paltrow and Spacey are good in their more limited roles. The cinematography includes much rain and dark, grimy interiors, making this outstanding neo-noir. The ending is twisted and unforgettable, reminding one of ""Silence of the Lambs."" The display of the murders is horrific but not overly gory. ""Se7en"" is not a formulaic mystery."
amathubagoldhq,"Jan 2, 2013",7/10,"Throughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse for murder. The director in ""Seven"" cleverly makes use the seven sins as Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin of them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the name of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their weaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets defending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The director David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch each brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman and Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the wiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer taunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are filled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want the killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more than that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and fills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also want him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him! The question to be asked, is the unborn child saved from been born in a world full of religious contradiction or should those who wrong us be punished without question?"
jerrylb,"Apr 30, 2008",1/10,"I know there are many reasons to like or dislike any movie, and that most people who rate a movie 1 or 0 simply don't 'get it'. I feel a great sympathy for those who cannot find anything to praise in a film. Se7en is not an especially bad movie; it creates and maintains a particular atmosphere most of the way through; it is deliberately grungy, nasty, and brutal. The extreme lack of lighting serves a purpose - Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now seems bathed in floodlights by comparison - and the film achieves its ends efficiently enough.I am relatively OK with gore and violence (either on-screen or implied.) Many plots have holes, many movies get very clunky at the end, many actors share features with cardboard, and Se7en is no exception. If this film were in any way critical of the human capacity for the sheer unbridled brutality which it portrays, I might forgive it. If it had any redeeming qualities whatever, I like to think I would be prepared to try to acknowledge them, however grudgingly. Many dark movies manage to evince a knowing smile at some point, or succeed through technical brilliance or gripping acting.But I came out of this film wanting to throw myself under the nearest bus. It was as if everyone involved with the making of this film had spat (I think I spelled that correctly) in my seat. My experience of this film exactly matched that of another reviewer: it raped my soul. What worries me most is that there are quite so many positive reviews for this movie. I think this would have been one of H.P. Lovecraft's favourites, since the guiding hand behind it is most obviously that of Cthulu."
dblegendsdragonballs,"Jun 28, 2024",10/10,"David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence. With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking you off the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear."
jameslinton-75252,"Apr 18, 2016",8/10,"Anyone else think that Kevin Spacey is being type-cast as psychopathic serial killers? It's only because he's so damn good at playing them.Se7en is no exception. In this film, he plays the unnamed serial killer who kills people in conjunction with the seven deadly sins. His portrayal of the serial killer is chilling, unnerving and powerful. Se7en delves well into his backstory and fleshes him out as a character.Although I did think the film was a little anti-climactic in terms of its scariness. I expected a crime thriller to be gorier than this and I was disappointed when it wasn't, but this is more of a minor criticism.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/04bo6s"
buckeyes-05926,"Apr 18, 2024",10/10,"The best the Crime Mystery Genre has to offer. A deep and quality genre of films. This homicide thriller has a tantalizingly morbid atmosphere of unease. A dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller. It's intriguing, appalling, savvy, nasty, grossly unsettling. You may not like what you see, but you'll definitely be affected by the sight and will not be able to turn away and definitely not able to turn off the TV. The film is anything but dull. David Fincher style makes the film and instant classic that will be remember for the test of time. Just not the film to put on for a family outing and causal gathering of friends."

The story is also really good it keeps you engaged and curious. for acrime film its done In a different way than I'm used to, I'm used to the new age crime cop movies and this is done a lot better. The crimes are sick and twisted but they are key to the story and moveing it forward and very well thought out and purposeful.Also the shots and cinematergraphy are so beautiful and well framed."
Sonic_Ocean,"Jul 22, 2013",10/10,"Getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things I've done for myself as a person who loves film. Deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. Movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. This is everything that makes Se7en a great movie, in my opinion.I could go on and on about the film, but first I have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. It is just pure grit and grime and I love the film's consistency in its tone. Not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. These aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. A key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in film thus far.What also makes Se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from Morgan Freeman who makes each movie I've seen him in have depth and character. While Freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, Kevin Spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. To deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching Hannibal Lecter on screen was a feat that I didn't even know could be accomplished. I was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. He was that captivating in his acting performance.I don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch Se7en. The film is so good that I had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. A pure classic in every way."
lucasrosano,"Apr 8, 2016",10/10,"This is the best movie that i have seen of my life. The acting of brad pitt and morgan freeman is amazing. I think that David Fincher could do one the best thrillers of the cinema history. I still see some director trying make something like that, but never it be possible. It has many scenes that will be in my mind forever. Kevin Spacey do a work awesome doing of murderer how also morgan freeman like detective. Without a doubt it has a plot interesting of the beginning until the final. I'd like to watch more film of this style. I'm boring of watch films about super heros and romantics or teenegers like Maze Runner, Papers Cities. C'mon Fincher for more movies like that!!"
Reyhan5289,"Mar 17, 2022",10/10,"I watched Se7en assuming it would be a regular detective movie. I am happy to say that I have been proven wrong to a great degree. First off, I'd like to gush over how perfect the cinematography is for this movie. The intense downpour of rain present throughout (most of) the movie adds so much to the noir atmosphere the film evokes. The lighting is quite minimal throughout the movie. This choice was obviously made to create a more claustrophobic and creepy ambience and I would say it works. Howard Shore's score is not too noticeable in the film, it does add tension and in the final act it does help with freaking out the viewer even further.The disgusting murders shown in this movie are what set it apart from other crime/thriller films. Not to spoil anything, but the people who made this were certainly creative. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are beautifully cast here. The best way to see this movie is completely blind like I was, so I won't give anything away.This movie is definitely not one to forget and is a must-watch.10/10."
moonspinner55,"Oct 3, 2005",6/10,"There's a serial killer on the loose in rainy New York City who's modus operandi is to stage seven grisly crime scenes modelled after the Seven Deadly Sins. He is soon aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and becomes enamored with their drive and determination. Hit thriller from director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker is mostly left vague and unexplained. We learn precious little about the psychopath except that he's highly literate and educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. Fincher mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of déjà vu (it has ""The Silence of the Lambs""-itis). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The lust-and-death-soaked atmosphere is wallowed in--it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell--and, certainly, the grimy vibes are palpable and captured successfully, but they're also off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like ugly crime scenes from the evening news, and Fincher and Walker aren't clever enough to distract us nor cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible. It's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger, sick-making scale. **1/2 from ****"
pzjg1,"Apr 9, 2006",5/10,"I had been waiting a long time to see this movie and I finally had the chance. #42 all time? 8.4 on IMDb? Man it must be GREAT.Instead, what I watched was a slow, almost boring movie. Where were the great twists? It was amazingly predictable. Guys print on a wall? Bet he's missing a finger or hand. Guy starved to death? Bet he's still alive, why else would they so lovingly pan over the body? Friday the 13th did that, too. Nice serene music and BAM! I wasn't counting on Seven being a ""slasher film"" but it sure seems to have followed many of the ""tricks"" of cheaper slasher films.There was some character development, I guess, and i'm sure that slowed things down a bit, but that hardly made this a great film.And why was it so damned dark half the time! IT ISN'T NECESSARY! Man I hate that in movies.Anyways, i'm sure some will love it. I found it totally run of the mill, with a lot of wasted star power."
cwat-97965,"Oct 6, 2022",8/10,"This movie is incredible for a multitude of reasons. The acting, the premise, but I think one of the things that really sets this film apart is the pacing and deliberate cinematography to create a sense of dread. During the scenes at the crime scene they light the scenes and have the camera follow the lead characters in a way that enables us the viewer to discover the true horror of the acts committed as the lead characters do. We as the viewer are along for the ride and experience the sheer horror and rising terror that the characters experience in the moment.Also, Brad Pitt's line ""What's in the box?!"" might be my favorite line he's ever spoken in a movie."
imdb-92083,"May 18, 2024",9/10,"David Fincher directs Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman. Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow in a hunt for a serial killer, slowly knocking off innocents based on the 7 deadly sins.Pitt does his usual head scratching, hair fluffing as seen in Fight Club and Twelve Monkeys, Freeman is as calm and slow speaking as ever, almost sounding like narrating in The Shawshank Redemption. Spacey is as creepy as ever.They quickly work out the killer is basing his kills on the 7 deadly sins as the murders add up until only one is left.The climax is unforgettable as Spacey turns the tables on Pitt. In one of the most dramatic finales I have seen.It comes from a time when films were films, these days it would be a Netflix mini series, with adverts liberally scattered throughout- breaking the flow. 2hrs6minues extended to over 3 hours once you have adverts every 5-10 minutes.Classical music, long shots instead of the ADHD style of cutting every few seconds, silence, without dialogue- it's a classic."

DavidYZ,"Apr 20, 2017",9/10,This is an excellent serial killer thriller.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play police detectives who together are tracking a serial killer who kills people who have each committed one of the seven deadly sins in a way that's relevant to the specific sin. Kevin Spacey plays the killer.
Nikhil_87,"Feb 11, 2004",9/10,"This great thriller is about a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) and his Se7en victims who represent the Se7en deadly sins. Two cops (Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt) have been assigned to investigate this case.This is the best movie of the 90's, it has great thrilling moments, Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitts performances are excellent. Se7en has one of the best but shocking and surprising endings of all time. The end is something nobody would expect, i kept rewinding over and over again to see them 3 short seconds where you see... (im not going to spoil the movie).Kevin Spacey's role in this movie was a surprise for everyone, well except for the people who use IMDB, it said who the killer was played by.The most shocking moment for me was when you see that body on the bed and everyone thinks that person is dead because of the state of the body, but its not, that scene shocked me alot, i never forgot it and never will.Overall i gave Se7en 9/10, everyone that likes thrillers should go see this movie, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
BaronBl00d,"Mar 2, 2008",9/10,"Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride."
deleyshaun,"Aug 10, 2024",9/10,"Se7en - for the most part is a procedural thriller/ mystery featuring detectives young idealist ( Pitt) and cynical and experienced (Freeman) together. They are chasing the clues of a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as the denominator of his kills. You don't actually see the murders- only the aftermath. Throughout - the movie delves into themes such as banality of life, evil and humanity intelligently. And at the same time doesn't deviate from the story moving along. There is a lot of dread throughout which is fitting. What elevates this film to ""greatness"" is the final 35 minutes- featuring discussions between the villain ( Spacey) and the detectives after his voluntary surrender- and then the final denouement which will test the viewers faith in this world we live in. It is extremely rare that a film builds you up to expecting a great conclusion - but then actually delivers on this promise. The acting is first rate by all and is masterfully directed by Fincher with great score throughout- especially the last scenes. A truly life changing experience. An absolute must watch."
vav-61764,"Jul 12, 2015",9/10,"As I was watching Se7en, I was both shocked and fascinated, this movie surely can be used as a mirror to other suspense films to show how they should be made. The anxiety and apprehension grows along the film for having such a captivating story, even if some scenes are very disturbing to watch, you can't take your eyes off. Another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling. The director, David Fincher, did an amazing job in crafting this movie, it's proved how talented he is and something noteworthy is in some particular scenes, how they were shot regarding the style, angles of the camera that make you feel like you're in the scene.The cast, both leading and supporting, did a marvelous work in performing the characters. They're so consistent and believable, we really have the chance to know the identity of every single one in terms of dreams, emotions, regrets. Morgan Freeman plays an old detective, Somerset, who is fed up with his detective's life, because the city and the world as in general are too hateful, the apathy is present in people's everyday life and he can't take any longer this. He's methodic, pragmatic and due to his long career in the police, he's very meticulous in a crime scene. Detective Mills is played by Brad Pitt, different from Morgan Freeman's character is a young detective with a lot of stamina, enthusiasm but he's reckless and very emotional too. The contrast between the characters is pretty perceptible and is very well explored to show a man already marked by a tough and cruel world, Somerset, and other still untouched and a bit naive about the cruelty of the society.The murder scenes are so realistic and disgusting, they really make you feel uncomfortable and revulsion witnessing them and passing how sick the serial killer is. The murderer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey. The tension drastically grows when he's speaking, his performance succeeds in portraying a person mentally disordered, a psychopath. No Doubt, John Doe after such a remarkable acting gained a sit among the most famous psychopaths of the cinema."
deatman9,"Oct 14, 2012",7/10,"This movie was just awesome.A thriller that really leaves you on the edge of your seat the whole time your watching. It starts morgan freeman who always does a superb job, accompanied by brad pitt who always did an outstanding job. And to top it all off it was directed by David Fincher who has made some great movies.This movie is about two detectives (Freeman,Pitt) who are sent to invesitage a weird string of murders. There is a murderer killing people using the seven deadly sins as justification.Overall this movie was really good. Great actors, great story line and a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested. I really liked it."
archiebalsdon,"Apr 8, 2022",N/A,When I first put on the movie my expectations were very high and still it exceeded. The characters are fun to watch and Brad pitt was incredible. The villain was scary and the twist? Unbelievable.
therealwargame,"Dec 19, 2015",10/10,"David Fincher's great style of directing, a movie that's brilliantly dark and it's superbly acted. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are a pairing couple or opposite personalities and Kevin Spacey is the villain we all love and hate, such a great performance. Intelligent writing with no clichés and the imagery of the grotesque never descends into thoughts unnecessary gore or sensationalism. Brilliant cinematography with a bleak tone, the film has a sense of dread and some moments are climax. Se7en sticks with you in your and it's really unforgettable. The plot keeps you hooked until the most terrifying final moments you will ever see. It is scary because it uses your imagination against you in a deep, deeper level. A classic crime thriller that remains uncompromising no matter how many times you watch it."
shahaberry72,"Mar 2, 2022",9/10,"I was too young to fully appreciate this when I first watched it. Now though, whole different game. I love it so much that I think I'm watching it every year. Fincher's finest."
sir_striker886,"May 1, 2017",10/10,It's very hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it so I need to keep it simple. Thinker/mind bender. Its insightful/disturbing nature is the only reason why I can see that it only has 8.6 rating. It's a movie you have to pay attention to. A movie you can watch over and over and always find something new. If you don't agree with that... watch it 5 years from now.
hooflethroid,"Jan 11, 2004",10/10,"I first saw this movie when I first visited America, I knew nothing about this film (as it had just opened) so I paid my money and gave the film a chance. It simply blew me away. The ending is just unbelievable. The performances are fantastic, the direction and art design are exceptional and Kevin Spacey (my fave actor) popping up towards the end was the icing on the cake. Plus every time I watch the film now it reminds me of being in America... it's my favourite movie, for so many reasons. :)"
berggeit9,"Jul 2, 2005",9/10,"Se7en is a reflection of our everyday life, we live in a world filled with media & information technology which makes people often live beside each other instead of with each other, even though the serial killer is portrayed as the devil in this movie i can empathize with his feelings/opinion about seeing sins on every corner of the streets. The intellectual, patient personality that's Sommerset & the young rebellious ""let's dance"" Mills really contrast each other, creating interesting character development.We as the audience are confronted with biblical/religious statements throughout progress of the film concerning homocide cases, if Sommerset had to choose a playing card then he'd retire as soon as possible, he's been doing detective work for way to long, but however he does get motivated by the unusual case of 7 sins that are about to unfold including all the plot twists & turns.Se7en has been directed with unusual grimmy & dark look, during the film it's constantly raining, as if time never seems to change the mood is captured with great directorial vision, the dark & wet apartments that seem to be abandonded for ages, a combination of brown & black colors recreating a new kind of innovative film noir, consciously leading us to unique cinematographic history.Sommerset comes to terms with our serial killer John Doe & even though they might agree on certain points when it comes to the subject of everyday life, these 2 characters are worlds apart at the same time, in a sense that John Doe murders his victims using the 7 deadly sins.Pacing of this movie is nice but if you're expecting a big action movie, perhaps you're better of watching a vin diesel (XXX) movie. We're invited by the director to be intellectually stimulated, while the story develops we must think along, asking ourselves new questions about every single horror murder committed as we go.With that said the film is in my humble opinion highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the acting skills of Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman, it's got quality(not much though)action, dark mood, acting, story development, character development, mystery, among others. Even though not for the faint hearted, since some scenes of the committed murders are visually shocking to say the least (adult rated), Se7en is a great police drama by director David Fincher. * * * * * * * * * 9 OUT 0F 10 STARS !"
danamadeus,"Jul 4, 2013",N/A,"I'm a little late to the party with Se7en, as I first watched it just this year. One of those things where it's been in the queue forever and I'm slowly working my way through. Anyhow as a result of my procrastination, my ""experience"" of the film was slightly desecrated, but my appreciation was not. I realized just before I reached the massive twist of the film that I saw what was coming. I don't even remember who spoiled it for me...but oh well.The only reason I address this is the final scene of the film is by far the most talked-about aspect of the film...by FAR. And I didn't think it was greatest final act shake-up I've seen, but the movie itself is incredible.My favorite part of Se7en is it's stylishness. David Fincher delivers a beautifully noir aesthetic to the piece that colors the entire story. And my other favorite thing about Seven is the surreality of the nameless, ever-raining, Gotham-like, hellhole city where our mystery unfolds. I cannot overstate how much I love that story-telling choice. It gives the film an immeasurable sense of dread and intrigue. Aesthetically, simply a masterpiece.Se7en's other major strength it its leads. The script doesn't over-talk anything; it's economical and concise, but provides just enough chemistry for it's protagonists to make this ""buddy cop"" film stand out. Pitt and Freeman turn in some of their most thoughtful work and play excellently off one another. It's a character piece that succeeds without dwelling too long on exposition or any forced ""bonding"". Their relationship develops naturally, and in the face of abject psychological chaos, calm moments are brief and rare.I suppose it would be unfair to not mention Seven's creatively macabre components as well. I realize I didn't include a synopsis, but if you haven't already heard it 100 times from cinephiles and review sites, I'm sure it's somewhere on this page. The killer in Seven patterns takes inspiration for his murderous work of art from the seven deadly sins, and dispatches his victims in accordance with said sins. But the bizarre and disturbing, (albeit not explicit) murders are still a means to an end. The film's really about the tone, characters, and noir feel. 8.1/10"
Tiamat10,"Jan 29, 2000",1/10,"I can't understand what the critics saw in this film.  It's basically a standard serial killer film full of cliches (old cop on verge of retiring and young eager cop full of new ideas -yawn) but with two main differences - the ending, and the sheer grossness of the murders.I've watched many horror and crime movies and I'm not squeamish but I found the murders so unpleasant that I became detached from the movie and started wondering.  .  The disgusting crimes combined with the general darkness and mumbled dialogue made the whole film depressing and hard to care about.As for the ending, it only served to remove any suspense that had been building up.  I didn't find the last few scenes shocking or surprising - I realised what was coming and just wanted it to be over.Well made - maybe.  Well acted - perhaps (if you could make out all the dialogue).  Innovative - yes, but not in a good way.  Imaginative - yes, but not the kind of imagination you want to dwell on.  Watch only if you actively enjoy being made to feel miserable."
Hitchcoc,"Mar 9, 2010",8/10,"I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again."
i_know_people,"May 10, 2005",10/10,"i love this film, it is the ultimate thriller film, everything about se7en is brilliant. the cast are well picked and make the best contributions, the main characters Somerset and Mills are portrayed perfectly through Freeman and Pitt. in my opinion this is both Pitt and Freeman's best film, they still have not outshines there fantastic performances. Paltrow as mills wife was a good choice though there are a few other actresses that could have played this part, though i think that what paltrow brought to the role was the fragile emotional side of the character, so i am pleased that she played this part so well. the director is my favourite of all time, Mr David Fincher! he is a fantastic director, not just for this film but for his other films like fight club. he gets fantastic results from his cast and crew and makes the perfect film. and as i'm a budding editor myself i have to mention the fantastic edit on the film, by the editor Richard Francis-Bruce, i do love the edit on seven as he cut at hit points and generally did well.if you haven't watched it watch it, if you've seen it seen it again! i certainly will."

People go into a lot of different emotions.Everybody thanks for the movie. These types of movies are not satisfied with one time of watching.
supertom-3,"Jul 23, 2004",10/10,"David Fincher has become one of Hollywood's most wanted directors since this film and this is a fantastic film. Since this he hasn't done a bad film, in fact most are excellent. Seven is more conventional than his films the Game and Fight Club but it has a great script which is fantastically directed. The actors of the film are of the highest calibre. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwynith Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are all fantastic, Freeman and Spacey in particular. The film has plenty of twists and is involving while everything comes to a shocking and stomach churning ending. This is definitely one of the best crime thrillers ever made.As with other Fincher movies it looks fantastic. The cinematography is outstanding. The score is also fantastic and the overall look and sound of the film is top class. This is a modern classic, no doubt. *****"
Mister_Gordon_Shumway,"Dec 2, 2007",10/10,"Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light ... (John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432)""Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tag-line for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher:~ Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain (R Lee Ermey) while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~ Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher (Zodiac) but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clichés found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp (Secret Window) was ultimately realised once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on. Se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, Se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all.Co-stars John C McGinley as California (captain of SWAT team)Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review."
swmoncur,"Dec 4, 2021",7/10,"At times, the movie felt somewhat drawn out to me. Most of the details and scenes were necessary to the buildup, but I felt it could've been done in a more concise manner. The setting and feel of the first 3/4 of the movie also began to feel repetitive and, at times, boring.With that said, the acting and plot in this movie were fantastic-especially the latter. The grand finale, which transpires over the last 20 minutes, deserves a 10/10 rating. Truly chilling the way it all comes together at the end. If it were all accomplished with a bit more brevity I think the desired effect would have been even more powerful."
gazzo-2,"Oct 15, 1999",N/A,"You are in for a real treat here film fans: endless scenes of torture, abuse, bondage, a beheading, rape; assault...body functions, the human condition as a Butcher block, if you will.Nothing in this movie makes me want to see it again-Morgan Freeman was better in the Electric Company; for Pete's sake, than he was here-and for Brad Pitt....he looks like he was mad at his agent for making him be there. Kevin Spacey is okay but so what? He was much better in Usual Suspects and the Negotiator. Gwyneth Paltrow as always seems vaguely emaciated, and the main co-star, the smothering rain-was as much in the way as anything else.Don't go see this unless you have always wanted to know what the cause of a Scripted Barfing marathon looks like. Personally I can't imagine why dreck like this and Hannibal Lector keep on getting made; Hollywood must be wanting to reach the Jeffrey Dahmer/John Wayne Gacy demographic more.Rating? ** outta ****; I hated this one-belongs in the goat bin."
peisherman42,"Jun 13, 2022",8/10,"The filter, the rain and the depressing elements from the city in general set the dark, mysterious vibe of the movie, grabbing your attention from the start.The actors are, as expect, amazing are delivering their lines and had a lot of chemistry with each other. The dinner scene was especially super natural and spontaneous.I also really enjoyed how the film isn't scared to show heavy gore in the victim's scenes.But, to be honest, the plot was not as intriguing as I was hoping for. Sometimes, the investigation seemed kinda forced, like they were really lucky to find answers. Maybe my expectations were way too high. Still one of the coolest thrillers I have ever seen tho."
pretg,"Feb 11, 2008",10/10,"This movie is such a 'blockbuster' that it is only movie I have ever purchased on DVD. I do not purchase movies because they are a waste of money to me, because I don't like to watch most movies more than once, and because it is so easy to download movies to ones PC from different websites for little money. But I purchased Se7en because this is the one movie I can watch over again. Me purchasing a movie is the highest assessment I can give. So watch Se7en for yourself; it is suspenseful, a thriller, has a great cast of actors who all perform outstandingly, and most important of all an ending no one could have guessed. I just wish that other writers, directors, etc., could produce more movies of this quality and genre."
emperor_bender,"Feb 24, 2008",10/10,"It really was. I saw this movie in a Five Below store. There were about 10 copies of the normal version, and abut 2 of the special edition ones that look like notebooks. I went on a limb and bought the special edition for $5. I had no idea what this movie was like nor what it was about. But I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. This movie turned out to be a personal favorite. Morgan Freeman was excellent, not just because he's a great actor, but because in this movie he was different than the ""optimistic, nature-loving"" characters he usually plays. In this movie he plays the close-to-retirement Detective William Somerset, who dislikes the world and what it has become. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the loud-mouthed, over-jumpy Detective David Mills. Usually I don't like Brad Pitt and I think hes obnoxious and a lousy actor, but in this movie I'll make an exception. He was obnoxious in some ways in this movie, but it fit his character perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a decent performance as the stressed Tracy Mills. R. Lee Ermey was great as the Police Captain, I always enjoy his performances no matter what the circumstances. Even the bad guy (Will not give the actor's name to prevent spoilers) was Grade A in his part. The weather was rainy for most of the movie, and scenes were always lighted in small doses, meaning it was dark and gloomy for most of the film. THis really set the tone. I recommend this movie to fans of crime, thriller movies. 10/10"
ketulpatel23,"Nov 9, 2024",10/10,"I love long movies where there is plot and deep cinematography. Se7en maxes all that and more it is an absolute thriller. It contains strong graphic content so it is not recommended if you are watching with children. The storyline is amazing far from predictable and the actors have played their characters quiet well. Amazing shots were captured in rain. A well-executed thriller crime suspense movie captivates the audience by combining intricate plotting with psychological tension, resulting in a compelling narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. This genre demands not only a masterful control of pacing but also an ability to craft a multifaceted storyline with layered characters whose motivations gradually reveal themselves. In a standout thriller, the screenplay balances red herrings and plot twists with precision, ensuring that every revelation feels both earned and surprising.The strongest elements of this genre often lie in the interplay of suspense and surprise. A great thriller doesn't merely rely on shock value; it builds tension through atmosphere and character development, often manipulating time and perspective to heighten anticipation. The strategic placement of dramatic irony-where the audience knows more than the characters-creates an unease that lingers even after the film concludes.Cinematically, these films leverage mise-en-scène and visual storytelling to reinforce the emotional undercurrent of the narrative. A moody, often claustrophobic setting can become as integral to the plot as the characters themselves, amplifying the sense of isolation or danger. The sound design and score work in tandem, subtly guiding the viewer's emotional response while intensifying key moments of suspense.Moreover, a well-crafted thriller embraces a dynamic moral ambiguity, often leaving the audience questioning the very nature of justice, right, and wrong. The protagonists, often flawed and morally complex, can blur the lines between heroism and criminality, compelling viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature.In conclusion, a truly remarkable thriller crime suspense movie is one that not only entertains but also challenges perceptions, providing a visceral experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It remains an art form that requires both technical skill and narrative ingenuity, marking the genre as one of the most enduring and impactful in contemporary cinema."
MissCzarChasm,"Apr 13, 2001",9/10,"Seven is by far one of the best serial killer movies ever made. This movie has a great premise, fantastic actors, great direction by David Fincher, and a fantastic gritty atmosphere.The story centers around 2 dectectives, both going down seperate paths. Det.omerset(Morgan Freeman) is heading toward retairment while Detective Mills(Brad Pitt)is just starting out his career. He's full of energy and opinions. Soon the both are on the msot disturbing case they have ever come across. A serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Sloth, Wrath, Lust, Greed, Envy. The killer is very smart and the two detectives soon realize that he is using them as a pawn to complete his masterpiece.The acting in this film is amazing. Morgan Freeman turns in a great performance. very subtle, yet commanding. He's like a wise-man spreading his knowledge to others. Brad Pitt is also very good in a more energetic performance. His character is pretty unlikable but he does have a certain charm. Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused but she is still very good. She's one of the only bright spots in this othe wise dark film. The killer, who's identity i won't give away here is avery effective in his small amount of screen time. He gives a very creepy performance that will leave a lasting impression.Another thing this film has going for it is style. David Fincher has put together a film with a fascinating atmosphere. It's very dark and it sets th tone for the film.I suggest you go out and rent this film if you haven't seen it. Also for fans of the film the 2 disc dvd is a must have."
matty79m,"Jan 22, 2005",7/10,"Se7en is an undoubtful masterpiece concerning suspense, locations and camera. The actors are also brilliant and the story is one of the most thrilling and intelligent of our time. Really great: none of the killings are shown and are left to the mind of the viewer. So, why should someone like me who has just written so nicely about this movie rate it with just se7en stars? It is because of its ending. Surprisingly indeed, but... I think, a little too surprising. In the ending this movie seems to lack in logic. The characters Pitt and Freeman are playing make some progress in the story and they get to know each other better and better. Freeman's role is the one of a very intelligent cop who often has to calm down the hot-headed character Pitt is playing. But in the last minutes of the movie - I cannot imagine why - he doesn't calm him down and absolutely underestimates the danger. It seems to me that this movie just wanted to have a surprising, shocking ending (it really doesn't need to have!!!) and spoiled it a little bit to me. But anyway, this is a brilliant movie everyone should have watched. Once again, se7en out of ten!"
pageblake,"Sep 2, 2006",N/A,"absolutely appreciated the movie upon first viewing and subsequent viewings....however, now after brad pitt's divorce and unseemly behavior with another woman resulting in birth of a child, my appreciation for the actor and movie have been altered. surprising, even to me, the movie does not hold the same significance....i thought i could rise above my personal feelings at brad pitt's apparent lack of integrity without it affecting my feelings for his movie/movies, but i cannot. he, like others, have nosedived in image for me. it makes me very sad, because i enjoyed enjoying success for him, especially after hearing about his climb to stardom, i.e., standing on the street in a chicken suit, etc."
Dr_Kruger,"May 21, 2008",10/10,"Thinking back, I do believe this was my first 18 certificate film I watched at the pictures and it left a real impression. It's always been a favourite even though for some inexplicable reason I have only seen it just the once.So it was with some trepidation that I bought the 2-disc DVD on ebay recently and decided to watch it the night before last. I wondered if knowing the dramatic outcome already would spoil the viewing pleasure of what goes before.....It didn't.I wasn't wrong as a 15 year old in my assumptions that it was the best thriller I'd ever seen and while I've seen some great films over the last 13 years I'm pleased to say that this one is right up there with the best of them. It's also weird how I seemed to remember every single detail from every scene, even with my notoriously dodgy memory.I just can't fault this flawless film, Fincher was on top of his game here and it's definitely my favourite of his and I am a fan of Fight Club"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 23, 2018",8/10,"Deeply unsettling and intensely dark, this hard hitting thriller relies on great performances and a fully developed script to create a relentlessly oppressive tone that builds a growing sense of unease throughout. 'Se7en (1995)' is an interesting and subversive detective drama that layers its gritty, grimy and gruesome aesthetic atop a competent and compelling mystery to toe-curling effect. Plus, that bleak ending and gut-wrenching twist really punctuate the piece - providing an apt, if horrific, release for all the tension built up before it. 8/10"
willyortegav,"Apr 12, 2020",10/10,"Simply put, a disturbing masterpiece. Everything was brilliant. From the acting to the screenplay and the cinematography. Wow, I'm still blown away by this incredible film. Kudos to director David Fincher, and of course to Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman for playing their roles so impeccably."
ciscokid1970,"Sep 8, 2007",8/10,"This movie is a cross between Silence of the lambs and Bone collector. There are some very clever investigation scenes and clever writing and set creation.This movie was a showcase for Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. This movie had one of Morgan Freeman's best roles where he plays a educated, intelligent and experienced detective. Brad Pitt has a role but is not as impressive.This movie certainly had a new approach to police / horror movies. This movie and Silence of the lambs brought a whole new level of gore and horror to mystery movies. This is not a kid friendly movie and does not have a happy ending."
The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Nov 12, 2007",10/10,"You really can't say enough about Se7en. It may have lacked critical acclaim (how this wasn't at least nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay is beyond me), but this film is easily in the top 10 films of the 1990's, and one could argue that it is the best. Andrew Walker pens a marvelous script that is brilliantly realized by David Fincher, along with the help of 3 of the greatest actors of their generations.David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young up and coming detective who's just been transferred. His partner is William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who's on the verge of retirement. Different though they may be, they must track a serial killer who is choosing his victims according to the seven deadly sins (gluttony, sloth, greed, lust, pride, envy, and wrath).What makes Se7en so excellent in my mind is how incredibly real it is. There's the gritty feel to the film, and Fincher uses great shots and locations to effectively pass on his intentions to us. The film is one of the most suspenseful I've ever seen, and that is also attributed to Fincher, not to mention a wonderful musical score. Andrew Walker's script is fantastic. Easily one of the best of all time. It's such a simple concept, but the creation of the characters and the depth and development of each one is one truly remarkable quality of the script. The best quality of course, is the unpredictable, unorthodox, and scary ending that will make your stomach sink like a weight. The cinematography and editing are brilliant as the film is fluid and seamless. Technically, this film is perfect.The acting...well, anyone who's ever said Brad Pitt is for show obviously hasn't seen this or Fight Club. He's wonderful as the motivated, yet rash and sarcastic David Mills. It's a great character arc, and Pitt plays the complex character with heart and ease. Morgan Freeman...what can you say? He's Morgan Freeman, so he's excellent. Once again, a well written character that the actor takes and makes his own. Freeman is magnificent again.Of course, our 2 detectives are great, but the true stand out of the film is the actor who plays the killer, whose inclusion in the film was kept secret until the day of release. Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything. He gives a magnificent, yet haunting and disturbing performance that will stick with you for day after day. It is one of the best villainous performances of all time. The final confrontation is spectacular because of him.All in all, Se7en is a must see if you are a movie fan. It's one of the best films I've ever seen, and you'd be a fool to miss this classic. As terrifying as it is suspenseful, Se7en is a thriller that will stick with you, an experience you'll never forget. I cannot recommend this movie more.10/10 --spy"
james_norman1981,"Feb 13, 2006",10/10,"Now don't get me wrong, I love Fight Club and will write a very positive review of that movie sometime soon. However, to me, Se7en will forever be the superior film.The plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. One is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of Los Angeles (I think), a place he regards as Hell on Earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. Of course, like every cop on his way out (in Hollywood at least) Somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. Instead it's the property of a young buck, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. Of course, where director David Fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered.Further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. This movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (Kevin Spacey's 'John Doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. The fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to Fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. Pitt isn't pretty, Somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Mills' wife Tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of LA has become a living nightmare inside of it.The cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. At no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. Fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. This technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. A corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. One tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! And when Fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint.In this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on DVD. Any criticisms I have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in Se7en, something I think Fight Club also suffers from. The minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. Instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. But that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all Fincher's work.All in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from Hollywood (and since I'm writing this the day before Valentine's day I feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). Every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an Oscar' pitches that I often feel when I see a modern, 'worthy' film. On top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. The director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (Somerset and Mills). This understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while Fight Club may be cooler, Se7en is superior.Therefore my recommendation is: if you haven't seen Se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!"
gbill-74877,"Aug 12, 2020",7/10,"Man, Kevin Spacey can play seriously creepy characters very well. His performance is excellent, though I'm not sure about Brad Pitt's (""what's in the boooxxxx?""). Gwyneth Paltrow's miniscule role is a complete throwaway, and Morgan Freeman is just kind of ... Morgan Freeman. It's an entertaining thriller but felt more than a little contrived at each step along the way, and to be honest, like pretty standard Hollywood stuff. I'm surprised it's as rated as high as it is."
Mr-Fusion,"Mar 22, 2017",8/10,"This is exactly why I hold fast to the idea of a second look, particularly when it comes to movies. ""Seven"" is Exhibit A, and what I'd remembered about it over the last twenty-odd years was the mindscrew ending - as well as the omnipresent rain and dingy interiors, a world I don't want to stick around in.But within that hopeless environment is a deeply unnerving thriller and even a good cop drama. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well-defined characters; theirs is an abrasive relationship but a good one to focus on as the world festers around them. The horrors in this movie run the gamut from shock to viewer's imagination; and as ghastly as those crime scenes are, they're handled with serious skill. And then there's the ending, a magic act that could've failed so easily, yet holds up amazingly well.It's surprising that such an ugly, wet and claustrophobic movie was filmed in Southern California. And that wretched setting gets under my skin. Who knows when I'll sit down to watch this again, but it surprised me as an adult.8/10"
debrahnava-52496,"Sep 16, 2022",10/10,"So very good! I especially loved the ending when David (Pitt) is saying 'what's in the box'... don't close your eyes because you will actually see Tracy's (Paltrow) face, as the last image David saw of her. It's a brilliant and compelling cinematic move. It makes for really fun viewing because it's just a nano/split second, but once You see it - you can never unsee it. It stays with you forever. The whole film is wonderfully gritty and stands the test of time so well. We just viewed it again and realized how really classic it is. Take it in again... and I promise - you won't be disappointed. Bravo - David Fincher!"
bwicknoff,"Mar 24, 2023",10/10,"WOW. Thats how to describe this movie. Absolute masterpiece that everybody needs to watch at least once in their life, wouldn't be surprised if everyone has already seen this once in their life, it is that GREAT. Now whoever put Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deserves a medal for life because they created the BEST DUO OUT. The story is so well written, the movie has your interest the entire time, I can watch this for the rest of my life and never be bored of it. Everybody involved in this movie needs an oscar each, it is just a history record breaker of being the greatest movie ever made of all time. Every actor, scene, suspense, plot, story in this makes it the movie it still is today. It is so hard to reach this high of a level of a movie nowadays, just an incredible watch. Thanks to all for creating this gem!"
billion_mucks,"Nov 30, 2007",10/10,"What is the most simple way to present the Human's dark side? The answer is by sins: Sins that from the Fifth Century announce Man's most awful deviations from God.This movie isn't catholic yet, nor does it have an approach: it's impressively dark and violently grim. From the first start, the characters are presented surrounded by a whispering, sad rain. The mood is also set with dampened colors and grayish tones. Nobody ever smiles in the film, they laugh for few seconds when united in a dinner. But throughout the story, Detective Mills (Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Freeman) will set up on a case that is horrendous and enigmatic: a serial killer roams the city with the Capital Sins as basis to create his assassinations. He preaches, according to Somerset. Mills isn't accustomed to the following Odyssey, he is yet not aware of the fatal obscurity of the Human Mind. Somerset is about to retire, and he knows what he deals with his job, Morgan Freeman with his tired eyes show you everything the character has seen among his trail.As the play is opened; the killer behind the murders shows to be analytical and intelligent and he isn't afraid of people chasing him: he just introduces him to his ultimate ""work"". He plays with them. He presents a puzzle for them to solve as he is in total control. Kevin Spacey will surprise everyone with his psychotic demeanor and his empty gestures, showing spiritual deprivation.""Se7en"" is likely not for everyone. It is intended to expose the Dark, Twisted side of mankind, engulfed by a series of morbidly well thought murders. Actings are stupendous, all variating from a negative panoply: depicting Sadness, Anger, Worry superbly. Nothing is cheerful, nothing is lightning and warming. The movie shows you perfectly what man is all about on their obscure range. It is shattering, it is demanding. But it is one of the most excellent experiences on nowadays cinema."
Roastie,"Aug 10, 1998",10/10,"This film is pure genius, it nearly made me give up writing altogether. But instead I decided to become a darker, more disturbed writer. Fincher directs as a pro and Morgan Freeman is a God like actor in my book. Genius!!!!!"
raphaklopper,"Jun 8, 2013",10/10,"Sin: 1-transgression of divine law;2-any act Regarded to such a transgression, especially the willful or deliberate violation of some religious or moral principle;3-to commit a sinful act. The Sins began the film and led to the end,but it was no sin making this film.""Se7en"", as you can see, it is about the seven deadly sins: Gluttony; Greed; Sloth; Lust; Pride or Vanity; Envy; Wrath. It all starts when the veteran Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the rookie detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are both faced with a line of murders, and every death there is a message written with one of the deadly sins. They begin to notice that the killer, who later discover is called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) uses all sins for a different kind of murder. Soon both detectives begin a long study and research behind the insane psychopath who will later lead them to an unexpected end.With ""Se7en"" David Fincher showed the fantastic director that he can be. He went from hated (thanks to ""Alien 3"") to a true filmmaker giving a spectacular direction. Each scene is shot accurately making the film more tense and the investigation more thrilling. But it also gives credits to Andrew Kevin Walker (screenplay) with a superb writing delivering dialogs very well written and developed, and an insane study in each of the sins, but even with the gloomy environment, the movie manages to have humor that pretty much serves to calm the frantic pace.The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman superb as always; Brad Pitt once again great; but who stands out is Kevin Spacey, after his appearance everything in the film seems to have a relapse, the suspense increases, the atmosphere darkens, all thanks to its whimsical and cultured expression of ""serial killer"".An electrifying thriller, well directed and written, loaded with stunning performances, leading to an unexpected ending. ""Se7en"" is the film that brought David Fincher to filmmaking life and to the world his fantastic films."
alejandroalcantara_,"Jan 24, 2022",7/10,"77/100Se7en might just be the least David Fincher film out of all of the films I've seen from him up until this point. Nevertheless, that intent at keeping the audience at the edge of their seats in the very final act is still there. Besides from his hability to expand the screenplay's own storytelling with his impeccable usage of spaces and locations we've all seen to have improved over the years.Even when I can't fully settle for the writing structure this movie aims at, which usually tends to mess around with conveniences, any lack of quality can't be prevailed. Anyone who calls this film ""badly written"" is just stupid.Pitt does a great performance all the way to the very end, but who I want to call out is Freeman. He definetly became my favorite performance out of the whole film on account of the elaborateness he seeks in order to take over the scene he's acting in, even guiding some of the actors he's collaborating with as they go on.Even when Se7en doesn't have the charm I've grown to love from David Fincher, this still very much is a film of his, and he managed to let us know the potential he eventually took advantage of was still there, even if it was just his second film."
AMar_rom,"Jun 29, 2013",N/A,"Se7en has a lot of things going for it: A talented director and two among the best American actors of the past 20 years (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, the second at the start of his career). Furthermore, the plot is interesting enough: two detectives (Somerset and Mills) the first just before retirement with his much younger colleague try to resolve a number of murders perpetrated by a serial killer somewhere in a north American city (looks like Philadelphia but could be Chicago, it does not matter).I think the strength of the movie lies with the interaction of these two characters who are so different from each other and see their job from very different perspective. Both are very good professionals but Mills is more ambitious and sees the murders as a puzzle to be solved and does not spend much time trying to understand the killer's motivations and mindset. Whereas Somerset is more resigned and perhaps pessimistic about the efficiency of the police force to fight and contain the evil of the serial killer and the crime in a big metropolitan city like the one the action takes place.Finally, I thought that the movie tried to impose a visual style, e.g. The way of showing detailed images of crimes and torture that made me feel uncomfortable at times. If the director's message is that crime is bad because it looks 'bad' visually then I have some reservations."
max-850,"Mar 20, 2009",1/10,"This movie is almost unwatchable because of the pornographic use of violence. There are filmmakers who use violence sparingly when necessary and then there are the ones who wallow in it like porn. This is an example of the gratuitous use of violence. The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers. David Finscher is talented but I can just imagine him and Quentin masturbating to graphic violence. They need it to get off."
Alemme01,"Mar 14, 2013",10/10,"This movie effected me emotionally more than any other movie I can think of. (Except maybe for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, for different reasons.) Basically, it's about a young cop and an old cop who's about to retire, who investigate a serial killer whose murders are based off of the seven deadly sins.What makes it so horrifying is that you see the aftermath. You hear the investigations, as they detail what happened. Match that with the images of the dead bodies, and you've got yourself a profoundly effective mental image. Good luck sleeping tonight! Aside from the disturbing elements, the movie is still a good movie. Pitt and Freeman give great performances as usual, and it helps that their characters are likable. Pitt's character is an arrogant ass. Or is he? As you find out by the way he acts outside the police station, he seems likes a fun guy to be around. And as the movie goes along, you see how his job and the disgusting murders that he has to get knee deep into affect him as a person. Freeman's character is pretty much the straight-up good guy, and you could argue that he's the typical ""retiring black cop"" that was made more common by Glover's character in the Lethal Weapon series.The story is very engaging, as the investigations become more intense, and the more the protagonists get wrapped up in the case. So much so, that the climax (which begins with possibly the most heart-pounding chase scene I've ever seen) becomes one of the most jaw-dropping and engrossing pieces of film I've ever witnessed.The dialogue is good, but with only a couple memorable lines (which I won't say, because they either possibly spoil the movie, or aren't that great unless you've actually seen the scene.) However, with that said, the dialogue is used as a tool for sending a graphic mental image to your head during the murder scenes. And that, is probably the best words can do in a movie.Overall, if you can get over the shudder-inducing murder scenes that I've only brought up about a thousand times up to this point, definitely give this movie a go."
CuriosityKilledShawn,"Sep 30, 2006",8/10,"After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". Good luck.Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect."
davispittman,"Jul 13, 2015",10/10,"This film got everything right! I mean every single casting choice, scene, and line was perfect! This was Brad Pitt's best role in movie, I don't recall a movie where he ever achieved better acting than here. Also, in my opinion, the same goes for Morgan freeman, him and Brad make a great on screen team. The film was a real mind bender, which I love! The dialogue was unbelievably great! The plot was so genius as well. The twist ending was one of the best twist endings I've ever seen hands down! This movie has perfect acting, characters, plot, dialogue, ending, and it definitely keeps your attention throughout, I wasn't bored once, and that's very important to me! 10/10, not a single flaw 👍🏼"
iquine,"Feb 16, 2022",10/10,"If you've seen this film, you'll know what I'm talking about by the review headline. This film does not mess around. Every aspect is on point. From the lighting, color pallet, accurate dialog, camera movement, character development and of course the editing and script. This is a tense and gruesome story with thrills that don't rely on a loud sound effects but in pure genuine and unexpected surprise, shock or even disbelief. This is about two detectives, one an intelligent veteran about to retire and a young buck who just moved to this city with his wife. They team up on what ends up being the start of a serial killing spree. It is really interesting to watch how the two detective's approaches to just about everything are in contrast to each other and how they begin to gel as partners. But the real story is the gruesomely unique killings they must investigate as they attempt to stop the killer before his finishes his plan. This film is hauntingly engrossing as all cinematic facets engulf the viewer in tension. If you have the stomach for such things you'll want to but never be able to forget them; this is a must see."
loganschainker,"Sep 8, 2022",10/10,"When Se7en was first released, it was viewed as nothing more than a ""gorey shocker"". Today, it's considered a classic. This was the film that put David Fincher on the map. Alien 3 was technically his first film, but it was awful and he barely had any control over it. He stated that he would rather have brain cancer than make another film at the time. But thank God he continued. He was a born master with his signature perfectionist filmmaking. The performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptional. They played off each other so well. Especially during the scene where they talk about apathy. The dialogue in said scene was incredible. This film also contains one of the best finales in cinematic history. Right up there with Whiplash. Se7en is yet another one of my favorite films of all time."
barnabyrudge,"Dec 5, 2003",N/A,"A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.Detective David Mills (Pitt) joins a new homicide squad in a particularly unappealing and unsafe (un-named) city. He is partnered with William Somerset (Freeman), an old, wise, experienced cop who is just a few days from retirement. The mismatched pair are sent to a crime scene where a fat man has been tied to his dinner table and forced to eat and eat and eat until his stomach bursts. Scrawled on the wall is the word ""Gluttony"", and when other bodies start turning up alongside messages like ""Greed"" and ""Sloth"", they soon realise they are dealing with a serial killer who gets his ""inspiration"" from the seven deadly sins.However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. The ingenuity begins to show in a scene as powerful as it is unexpected, in which the killer gives himself up with two murders to go. For a moment, it seems that the film has made a terrible mis-step, but in actual fact we are being readied for one of the most fiendishly clever and shocking climaxes imaginable. The film ends on such a cruel note you'll come away from the film wanting to shout ""no - that can't be it... it can't end there!"" Oh, but it can! What's most disturbing is that when the killer explains his motives, he actually makes a totally valid and agreeable point about why he chose his victims. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). The best mainstream Hollywood film of the '90s."
ccthemovieman-1,"Nov 11, 2006",8/10,"I am shocked that I watch, much less own, this movie, and as often as I do. It's so dark, so uncomfortable to watch in many spots and so profane (although I use a TV Guardian) that it's not a very likable story and film.....but I find it fascinating. Let's continue on with the bad, and the good, of this film - at least from my vantage point.THE BAD - As a Christian, I get tired of seeing the villains, the sickest of serial killers, portrayed as Christians. It's unbelievable Hollywood bias that would never be tolerated if minorities were the constant victim of this kind of prejudice. In case, you don't get the message they even pass by a brightly-lit neon cross in the guy's room! That, and another cheap shot about a Southern Baptist being the killer, and comments about the sicko ""preaching a sermon"" plus Kevin Spacey's talks about people's sins....all are designed to portray a sick killer as a religious nutcase. Also, for further Liberal slants, good-guy Morgan Freeman is talking to Gywneth Paltrow at a neighborhood diner and he relates having talked an old girlfriend into having an abortion which Freeman says, ""to this day, I am positive it was the right move."" Yet, he also says it was a mistake and he regrets it. Huh?? Other negatives include too many f-words and usages of the Lord's name in vain, mos of them said by Brad Pitt. There are also several really, really downright gross scenes in here. If you don't expect them, you can easily be shocked with these disturbing images: some very sick pictures of tortured and mutilated bodies.THE GOOD - Despite all of the above, the story - as shocking and sordid as it is - is a fascinating one. It gets you so involved that it's almost impossible to put down, even with the unpleasant scenes. The finale is memorable, too. I also appreciated the wonderful cinematography in here. There are some strange colors in here but it all looks fantastic on the special-edition DVD. Spacey was relative unknown in his acting career at this time was riveting in that final 30 minutes when he had his speaking lines. All the actors in here are excellent. This is a film that is impossible to forget.OVERALL - As a friend once told me, ""This movie is very disturbing."" It's also extremely interesting, but beware it's not easy to watch."
zhivago97,"Aug 4, 2022",10/10,"Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, a misunderstood but well meaning community leader who does good deeds in dirty New York City. His goal is to help people. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are two bumbling detectives who add a comic element. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a depressed wife who goes on a spiritual journey and ends up in a better place with some help.Overall the movie is upbeat and really points to how important it is for people like Kevin Spacey/John Doe to help others overcome their inner demons from obesity to laziness and other evils. His techniques are very effective! And he even does expert manicures! He is a multitalented saint.After watching this movie, anyone can become inspired to help those around them be better people."
