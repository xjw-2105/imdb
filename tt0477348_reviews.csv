Hey_Sweden,"Feb 9, 2013",8/10,"Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile. Eight out of 10."
ProfRevDrFilmReligionHistory,"Apr 20, 2017",9/10,"No Country for Old Men won four Academy Awards in 2007, including Best Picture and Best Director(s). Despite the critical acclaim, the Coen Brother's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel was probably a bit of a head-scratcher to many people.The film's narrative begins in familiar fashion, introducing you to the main characters and setting up the plot using recognized, established filmic devices. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a suitcase filled with cash and wants to keep it for himself. Anton Chigurh is the sociopath who will stop at nothing to get the cash back. Ed Bell is the Sheriff tasked with bringing Chigurh to justice and, it is presumed, keeping Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, from danger. In addition, there's a corporate backer, a hired gun, and a Mexican gang who are also after the cash (i.e., the McGuffin). So much for the usual narrative elements.When the film continues far beyond the point that the expected narrative structure breaks down, viewers are left to grasp at what the film is actually about. What, if anything, is this film trying to say?I propose that the film is, among other things, a meditation on the impotence of human and divine systems of justice in light of unflinching, unrelenting, random, radical evil. There are a number of elements in the film that indicate such a meditation, but one need not look much further than the meditations of Sheriff Bell, whose words begin and end the film. Consider:""There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. 'Be there in about fifteen minutes'. I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure.""With these words, the film's ""story line"" unfolds, with Sheriff Bell trying, and failing, to be effective.At the end of the film, the retired Sheriff Bell describes a dream to his wife:""It was like {my father and I} was both back in older times and I was on horseback going' through the mountains of a night. Going' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going'. Never said nothing' going' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.""The film is nihilistic in both structure and content. If you would like to force a less despairing ending, Bell's dream could be interpreted as a ray of hope: a light shines in the darkness! On the other hand, it is a dream that he wakes up from.I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. But that doesn't mean I can't try."
Lechuguilla,"Jul 13, 2008",9/10,"While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. ""No Country For Old Men"" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.""No Country For Old Men"" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate."
Eric-Douglas-Statzer,"Nov 3, 2017",9/10,"Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there's nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole' cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he's ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.With its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you're left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it's a score that's frightening and precise.-Eric Statzer"
littlemartinarocena,"Mar 4, 2008",10/10,"I don't remember being so scared in a movie theater since ""Don't Look Now"" Here the Coen Brothers take everything a step further with exhilarating ease. The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them."
Xstal,"Apr 29, 2023",8/10,"An opportunity presents to get rich quick, a stash of cash made up of bills thick as a brick, but your conscience sets a trail, for a reaper to assail, a real psycho, has a vessel with a kick. You start to make a run, but you're tracked down, these pursuers cause a grimace, and a frown, until you spot the hidden tracker, locater for deadly attacker, you make escape, but get injured, as you leave town. Determination keeps the story rolling on, everyone risks, the singing of, their own swan song, the lives of others are ignored, fate, luck, destiny explored, but the bounty counts for nothing, if you're long gone.Some of the finest cinematic characters you'll encounter."
DonFishies,"Nov 26, 2007",8/10,"Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.8.5/10."
jp71ph,"Mar 5, 2008",9/10,"It was not very long before I watched 'No Country for Old Men' that I watched the other remarkable film of 2007, 'There Will Be Blood.' Back then I thought that Paul Thomas Anderson has delivered the Best Picture of the year with his oil epic, but after watching the Coen brothers chilling and violent adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, I knew right away that here was a film destined to be even a greater film than any I've seen this past year.It's not easy to watch 'No Country for Old Men.' The first time I saw it, I found myself dazed enough to not be able to stand-up immediately even after the whole end credits have finished. And yet, mixed with the feeling of shock is the profound sense of wonder and awe with what I have just witnessed on the screen. It took me another viewing to fully appreciate the meaning and intention of the film, and while the experience from watching the film is not one everybody will enjoy and understand, it certainly is one of the most moving and thought-provoking movies I have ever watched. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, the kind that stays with you even after a long time has passed since you've last watched it. On the literal level, it is a simple cat-and-mouse chase thriller movie, but from within its roots lie a very profound philosophical and penetrating analysis not only of the characters and the situations involved in the story, but also of the kind of world we are living in today and the more monstrous sides of it we often choose to ignore.The story revolves around the chase between a guy named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin,) who stumbles upon a stash of money in a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert and a psychopathic but surprisingly ""principled"" assassin named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The third party and the moral center of the story is the guy trying to find both the hunter and the hunted, Ed Tom Bell, the old sheriff of a peaceful, but increasingly becoming violent locality in West Texas.The movie features the perfect mix thrill and excitement that would be expected out of a movie in this genre. The Coen brothers' direction of the particularly intense chase scenes between Chigurh and Moss are masterful, evoking emotions of suspense to the highest level and pushing the audience to the very edge of their seats. This is achieved by very careful editing and sound direction that perfectly recreates the tense atmosphere whenever a particular scene is being played out. Also remarkable is the photography (done by Roger Deakins) of vast scenes in the desert where even what the ordinary moviegoer would consider as ""empty scenes"", where no action is played out, tells a story in a visual manner, where even when there is no dialogue or action on screen, the sweeping images speak out for themselves.'No Country for Old Men' is rich in such bravura kind of film-making. The particular camera move, position and choice of background and other trivial details such as time of day, cloud cover or positioning of the props and point-of-view perspective offer the best experience for the audience, and the most effective means of story-telling for the Coen brothers. Just watch the scenes of Tommy Lee Jones as the tormented old sheriff being burdened by the challenge of something that is greater a force than himself, something that he ""does not understand,"" and you will realize what I mean. The environment and tone created by the filmmakers perfectly accentuates the performance of Jones and more importantly, the core messages of the film. This style is present throughout the film and one of the particular points that makes it more than just a chase movie.I must say that I can't help but agree to most people when they say the Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is the most disturbing character (and yet mesmerizing) to grace the screen since Anthony Hopkins introduced us to Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs.' Chigurh effectively radiates evil and embodies violence in a very intelligent and forceful manner that touches the fear in all of us. Like Lecter, he personifies evil not in the conventional and simple sense, but in way that somehow presents to us the whole magnitude and complexity of its nature. In the dialogue he speaks, a kind of thinking revealed is one that is calculating and deeply philosophical but essentially ruthless and sinister.The film's monumental achievement is in its ability to remarkably transport us into a world where the places, emotions, fears, anxieties, choices, morals and realities of life are strikingly brought to life and presented to us in a manner where we, after the whole experience, can reflect upon and look back with careful consideration. In the end, the moviegoer is left to marvel at the beauty (and madness) of it all. Here the theme of innocence lost as it is corrupted by evil and violence is explored in the most cinematic fashion, delivered perfectly with richness of emotion and the greatest impact possible. The violence and bleakness of it all is not there to simply evoke reaction or engage the audience, it is there to tell a story and impart an experience of great magnitude and intention, to which the Coen brothers have brilliantly succeeded. All at the same time the movie is a character study on the effects of evil and innocence lost, an exploration on the themes of fate and chance, an analysis of the freedom to choose and its consequences, a reflection on evil and good as forces of society and the investigation of basic human emotions such as hope, fear, love, violence and aspiration in the face of a variety of situations."
Craig_McPherson,"Nov 17, 2007",10/10,"There's very little ""good"" in No Country for Old Men beyond the mesmerizing acting and viciously dark screenplay. Instead, the unholy trinity of temptation, cynicism and pure, dark, evil take center stage in this modern western directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun.Bearing little in common with pretty much any previous Coen film with the possible exception of Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men is a dark, bleak, ode to the baser elements of the human soul, and a spit in the eye to the noble ones as well.With a structural trademark hinging upon breaking the conventional norms of predictability, No Country is a movie that will unsettle you at successive turns - in the way deaths are dealt out; by its palpable tension that can almost be cut with a knife, and its periodic deviations from the narrative norm  the latter likely the only Coen brothers ""quirk"" for which their movies are renown.Switching back and forth between the game of cat and mouse being played out by Moss and Chigurh and the investigation of unfolding events by cynical aging Texas Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the Coens weave a web of dangled threads that one can't help but expect will be neatly tied together at story's end, only to tie them up in ways that buck the storytelling norm and manage to be both unsatisfying and true to their nature at the same time.Unforgettable among this tableau is Bardem's Chigurh. The Spanish actor who has also appeared in Love in the Time of Cholera and Goya's Ghosts evokes the most amazing presence of a ruthless killer with his own twisted adherence to a bizarre code of ethics that nothing short of witnessing his performance can do it justice.Sadly, however, justice is one of the few items in abundance in this movie. And yet, as unhappy as I am that the Coen's screenplay defiantly refuses to cater to the audience's inherent desire for satisfaction, I grudgingly have to admire them for opting for the unpredictable.Consider the movie akin to one big coin toss  will it be heads or tales? Call it - you've been calling it your entire life."

lucasaq-1,"Nov 16, 2007",10/10,"""You don't have to do this,"" repeated words in this lingering film, which really does not feel like a typical Coen Brothers film to me. Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natured intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing."
fluffyrona,"Oct 29, 2007",10/10,"If you like films that literally take your breath away, then this goes to the top of the list.As stated elsewhere, Javier Bardem is so spectacularly evil and menacing that, if I were Mrs Bardem, I'd be worried about him coming home at night. The man exuded controlled evil, and I found myself not breathing when he came onto screen, yet couldn't take my eyes from him - a truly mesmerising presence.Tommy Lee Jones turns in a belter of a performance, and mention should also be made of Kelly MacDonald who nails a faultless Texan accent alongside a multi-layered performance (despite the paucity of her screen time).Beautifully shot, as you would expect, and with some (welcome) moments of humour amongst the gore, this is a very very fine film. Miss it at your peril, because when those little golden men are being handed out next year in LA, I predict a lot of them will be going to this film. A belter."
FiftyTwo_52,"Nov 8, 2025",8/10,"I went into ""No Country for Old Men"" skeptical - its reputation felt like critical overhype, and McCarthy's bleak worldview isn't typically my thing. I was completely wrong. This is masterful filmmaking that earns every accolade.The Coen Brothers strip their usual stylistic flourishes to create something stark and uncompromising. What emerges is a neo-Western that functions simultaneously as nail-biting thriller and philosophical meditation on violence, fate, and moral decay. The pacing is deliberate without dragging; long silences build unbearable tension that explosive violence releases only temporarily.Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is genuinely terrifying... a methodical killer who operates by twisted principles involving coin flips and fate. Tommy Lee Jones brings weary humanity as the sheriff who realizes he's outmatched by forces he can't comprehend. Josh Brolin makes Llewelyn Moss more than a plot device; his stubborn pride feels authentically Texan and tragically human.Roger Deakins's cinematography is breathtaking - vast desert landscapes become characters themselves, beautiful and merciless. The minimal score lets suspense build naturally, making violent eruptions genuinely shocking.The ending will frustrate viewers expecting conventional closure, but it's thematically perfect-emphasizing the randomness of violence and the futility of imposing narrative order on chaos. Not every moment is perfect, but ""No Country"" is undeniably great cinema.Rating: 8/10 - A brutal, beautiful meditation on violence that lives up to its reputation."

ClintsUnforgiven,"May 18, 2007",10/10,"I saw this film at a private preview screening in Pittsburg on 5/16/07. I went with five other friends. The entire group was male, 20 yrs old, and mostly college athletes. I explain the demographic of myself and my companions to reason why I was the only one that came away from the film completely satisfied. The story was fresh and different and I don't think my friends had the capacity to fully enjoy what was going on on-screen. I did. And I am still trying to fully understand what an accomplishment it is. Let me try to explain.The Coens begin the movie with a voice-over against a barren Texas landscape, much the way Blood Simple began. In fact, there are several similarities between the two films, like the auspicious lack of music. A reviewer whose name escapes me once said that all Coen Bro. films look great and sound better. I'll get to sound later but to talk about the look... Other than some CGI animals, which really shocked me in such an otherwise perfect film, each frame is filled with such interesting material that the tone is set perfectly so that as you view a scene, you know whether to wait on a laugh or brace for...A large part of what fills those frames is great performances. Perfectly cast is Tommy Lee Jones. He nails it, the crowd goes wild etc... That's expected though. Josh Brolin, on a very recent hot streak, has given us two tremendous performances this year and both would have been a Cannes if the superbly talented Tarantino was loyal to his material and friend and kept the masterpiece that was Grindhouse untouched. Brolin's performance in that film was spot on with the perfect amount of ham and cheese to set the tone for the whole movie. In this one, he shows he can do just as well playing strait and absorbing into character as he does at crowd-pleasing cheesballing it. Kelly Macdonald will have to do something else to prove to me she really isn't the Clara Jean character she portrayed even though I know she is a Scot. Woody Harrelson, who I think gets too much praise sometimes, is at his best here and actually manages not to get blown off the screen (well sorta) by Javier Bordem. Mr. Bordem's performance is a force, much like the character he portrays. His Chigurh is a representation of the lunacy of violence that exists in society. There is no negotiations with it, it has always been here and it will always be here. It/he leaves us in shock and terror and all we can do is... ??? The first thing that needs to be said about the sound is that if another film wins an award all year for sound or sound editing, investigations should be held and the judges' bank accounts monitored. The sound in this movie is so shockingly good. There is no music (save some comically placed source music)and the movie is all the better for it. People talk about the way the music in Jaws enhanced the tension of what was happening on screen. People should, from here on say that the lack of music and the placement of source sound in No Country for Old Men thrilled more.I am certainly rooting for No Country for Old Men to come away with the hardware from Cannes."

Move over O' BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call."

NO just NO this is a movie after-all there's a reason why even history & biopics are MOVIE'fied"
Thiago-Aghi,"Nov 30, 2025",8/10,"A tense, beautifully crafted thriller that proves how powerful silence and restraint can be. Bardem delivers one of the most terrifying villains ever put on screen, and the Coens' direction keeps every moment sharp and unpredictable. The pacing is slow and the ending divisive, but the craftsmanship is undeniable. An exceptional film, even if not flawless."
sam_smithreview,"Jun 9, 2016",9/10,"Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natures intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing."
saytosandeep,"Oct 13, 2013",8/10,"No Country For Old Men. It's a near perfect western thriller gone somewhat wrong in the end. Hero a hunter himself finds a bag full of money from a crime scene but then gets hunted down by a crazy lunatic killer. Adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying to help hero without his knowledge. The movie starts and flows like a clean water with edgy characters, tricky situations and some clever ideas. Then when you are all set for bang-bang climax, movie takes a different route, plot becomes ambiguous, motives become unclear and our hero is out of the story just like that. If you are not overly miffed by the deviation in last half an hour, then you would be attracted to this like an iron to magnet because of its crazy characters, witty dialogs, haunting atmosphere and chilling silence."
vailsy,"Nov 9, 2007",10/10,"there will be plenty of other reviews here on the story, acting etc etc but maybe less on the sound in the movie so i'll focus on that here..the Coen brothers are well known for paying close attention to detail in their soundtracks. i've always found in the past though that they have a tendency to go over the top with this, and the sound can become a little pretentiousnot so here. they don't try to do anything outlandish with the soundtrack but tremendous detail is placed on the effects and atmos in particular.just about everything sounds wonderful from the dropping of a bag, the uncurling of a wrapper to more 'interesting' sounds like the ricochet of a bullet from a metal bridge and of course the fantastic signature sound of our bad guy.. the nail/air gun. some wonderful atmos in the air duct for example, and even on the polished metal of a blown out door lock. subtle and excellent use of the surrounds is made, and i especially liked how they used this with some of the dialogueoverall i was really impressed. and as you'll likely hear elsewhere, the rest of the film was great too!"

chiragrathod09,"Jul 18, 2024",10/10,"""No Country for Old Men,"" directed by the Coen Brothers and based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, is an extraordinary film that combines gripping storytelling with profound philosophical questions. Set against the stark backdrop of West Texas in the 1980s, the film follows the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, centering on three key figures: Llewelyn Moss, a hunter who stumbles upon a suitcase filled with money; Anton Chigurh, a ruthless hitman with a chilling moral code; and Ed Tom Bell, a weary sheriff grappling with the changing landscape of crime and morality.From the very start, the film captivates with its haunting cinematography, capturing the desolate beauty of the Texas landscape and amplifying the tension that permeates the story. The Coen Brothers expertly build suspense through minimal dialogue and long, atmospheric shots, allowing the tension to escalate naturally throughout the film.Javier Bardem delivers an unforgettable performance as Anton Chigurh, a character defined by his cold and calculated nature. His portrayal is both menacing and magnetic, making Chigurh one of the most iconic villains in modern cinema. In contrast, Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss brings a sense of desperation and resourcefulness, while Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Sheriff Bell adds depth and gravitas, embodying the film's central themes of aging, morality, and the struggle to maintain one's sense of right in a world that appears increasingly chaotic.The screenplay is masterfully crafted, staying true to McCarthy's narrative style while allowing the Coen Brothers to infuse their own distinctive touches. The film raises essential questions about fate, chance, and the nature of evil, prompting viewers to reflect on the choices made by each character and the overarching implications of their actions.The absence of a traditional score further enhances the film's atmosphere, leaving the audience to absorb the tension and existential dread that permeates every scene. The CLIMAX and subsequent resolution deviate from conventional expectations, eliciting a profound sense of contemplation among viewers as they grapple with the film's ambiguous ending.""No Country for Old Men"" is a masterclass in storytelling, direction, and performance. It is a film that defies easy categorization and leaves an indelible mark on its audience. With its exploration of morality, fate, and the relentless passage of time, it stands as one of the most significant films of the 21st century-a gripping reminder of the complexities of human nature and the unsettling realities of life."
drisley-72230,"Jan 6, 2022",6/10,I have heard so much about this movie over the years I finally gave it a watch and I was mostly disappointed.The acting was great. The casting was great. The cinematography was top notch. But the story was pretty much just senseless violence as is common with American movies.At the end of the day it didn't make me laugh or smile; it didn't leave me pondering my existence or the meaning of life. There was really nothing to remember.
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 25, 2008",N/A,"No Country for Old Men (2007)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A hunter (Josh Brolin) comes across a group of trucks with dead bodies everywhere and discovers $2 million in cash, which he takes. Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what's going on. I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I've seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I'm not sure if that's how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don't expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he's on screen you can't take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I'm usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful."
jonflottorp,"Jul 23, 2022",10/10,"No country for old men is a great movie with one of the best characters of all time. Javier Bardem was great as Anton Chigurh.It has some of the best acting i've ever seen, i think most of the people who was in the movie chould've won an Oscar.Tommy Lee Jones was great.Ethan Coen directed it greatly and he should be proud.It's a top 5 movie for me and i recommend it to everyone. 10/10."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Dec 17, 2007",10/10,"No Country for Old Men is the movie that has everyone talking; this morning, I was reading how this is going to be the Oscar winning movie, I just had to find out where it was playing. I just saw this with my friend this afternoon and I was blown away. It's a little odd because this did not seem like a typical movie that I would love, but the performances were absolutely flawless and the writing was brilliant. My friend just kept saying how horrible it was, but I don't think some people are going to understand how great this movie really is or need to see it again to understand it. I was never really a fan of the Coen Brothers and their work, but the reason why I loved this movie is due to the fact that it points out the violence in the world and how far people will go to get money or drugs. No Country for Old Men is blunt and shows the ultimate evil of the world, but also the good as well.Llewelyn Moss is a cowboy who has just encountered quite a find, he stumbles across the desert to find several dead bodies and a truck load of heroin. When he walks a little farther, he finds another dead body, but there's something in a suit case that's a little bit more of what he could use, 2 million dollars! He's got everything in the clear, but he remembers one of the bodies that survived and needed water, so he goes back to help him out, big mistake. Now the serial killer who owned that money and drug load is after him. This serial killer, Anton Chigurh, is possibly the most cold blooded murderer and will not stop until he has his money and Llewelyn is dead. But also Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is trying to find Anton and find Llewelyn before it gets more deadly.No Country for Old Men is the most brilliantly written movie of the year. Javier Bardem, who plays Anton, will hopefully get an Oscar nomination for his performance. Javier pulled such a chilling performance, he was terrific and so frightening, I never really took a look at his talent until No Country for Old Men. Josh Brolin, it's truly amazing how far this man has come, from The Goonies to a gut-wrenching performance, he's great. Tommy Lee Jones also held his own very well and made the sheriff the most likable character and was the light in this dark movie. No Country for Old Men is a great movie, believe me, it's worth the watch, just take some time after the movie to think about it and what you have just seen, because for the first time, I can say that the Coen Brothers are really amazing.10/10"
fh147,"Nov 15, 2023",8/10,"This movie was so intense in the cinematography and the sins of danger and slow rolling tension that is the most theme I can find it this movie the feeling of slowly getting attacked and not knowing when and where.The main antagonist is some of the most scary villain, I have seen in a movie, Just chaos happening without a reason we can see as an audience, he determination almost make him feel like the predator. He is a horror villain.The contrast they uses where most of the scenes have a dark shadow to the mix it look so distinct and good and all the shooting when people get shots look so gory and disgusting in the best possible way it gives it a really big punch shots happens.And the way the characters are a few words makes it almost a silent movie where you have to judge it by the characters movement and the few lines they say it is so good and makes it so more tense.The actors did an amazing job and was totally believable I didn't not happen to find a logic floor anything like that. It was tossed a really good written and acted movie and especially the antagonist villain."
shanekraus,"Mar 30, 2022",7/10,"This is possibly the coen brothers best movie. A very dark thriller that shows characters being hunted. Anton is one of the scariest, most evil characters ever. The first half of the movie ramps up the tension, but the second half is kind of disappointing. Plus, the ending does feel pretty abrupt and unfinished. Still, this is a greater dark thriller."
perica-43151,"Jul 19, 2018",10/10,"If you want a movie about a likable but menacing hero (or perhaps antihero), then this is a movie for you. An effective agent of fate, Javier Bardem's character does not care what you think about his haircut or his ways. What he cares about are rules. But not your rules, he has a set of his own, just like in his world, he has the coolest haircut there is. And he wears it with confidence. The same confidence he executes his tagets, who have it coming. One way or the other, on the flip of a coin. And his ways are memorable, you have to give him that. This angel of death plays some sort of cat and mouse game, but this is not a man, this is a sublime being, and he is magnificent, inspiring awe. Cant say awesome since this word is ruined in the English language, but in 1940s, it would have been the most appropriate way to describe what the actor Bardem delivers. This is a must see movie..."
r96sk,"Jul 13, 2022",7/10,"I can't say I view this one positively. I clearly don't get it, which I'm fine with.I'm all for films that don't play it so straight that it's predictable, but at the same time I'm rarely a fan of films that are so full of themselves to end in such a derisory way. Listen, that's probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt, but 'No Country for Old Men' is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for me.I will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever, they are all fantastic. Javier Bardem is awesome, easily the star, and Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are all top value. Kelly Macdonald and Garret Dillahunt are also involved, I like them too. Stephen Root, Mr. 'L for Love' himself, as well. Away from the onscreen bunch, the cinematography is superb.It's the story. I didn't get what I wanted from it, at all. All the ingredients are there for a 10/10 film, that's the level I was expecting it to reach based on the opening half or so. The second half though... super disappointing! So many underwhelming choices. Such a waste of a strong cast... 'The Counselor'-esque. Bardem is also in that, sorry my dude!The fact I'm still giving this what I consider to be a positive rating shows how much the conclusion frustrated me. This had top tier written all over it but it somehow messed it up as it went by... and I'm not usually one to dig out a film's ending.In my defence, even some reviews (many, in fact) from people who love the film mention that the ending isn't perfect so I guess it just comes down to how the final moments sit with you. For me, evidently not good!"
AshleyO-699,"Oct 26, 2025",10/10,"No Country For Old Men was released in 2007, making me around 17-18 years old at time when I first watched this picture. Prior to this my movie collection consisted primarily of no sence shoot em up action movies. I had no real expectations watching this movie, in fact only reason I originally watched it was I was a fan of Tommy Lee Jones.Today I watched it again, counting over the years this may be the 8th time I've watched it as a rough guess. How can I justify giving this movie a perfect 10 star?Because of its impact on me. It didn't just change the way I looked at characters, it didn't just change what movies I would later watch and love. It literally changed everything about not just the movies I watched but what novels I read.It was the first movie where I observed something other than quality of special effects. It had me appreciate how certain camera angles were utilized in movies, how long shots could be meaningly effective. It made me appreciate when a musical score was or wasn't needed.What I made me appreciate most was it's use of characters. Some reviews have critized the lack of character development. I understand that notion but at the same time the movie is set in a short period of time, it's not the type of picture that needs the development of say a Breaking Bads Walter White. What I love most about the picture is that in two hours not one character or any of their dialogue feels unwarranted or not needed. Every Interaction is either integral to the story or necessary to understand a motive of the character.It's extremely well acted, everyone completely bodies their roles with no bystanders. Obviously the main praise from critics and award shows are aimed at Javier Bardem, personally I can't argue with that. And becoming the first Spanish actor to receive the Best Supporting Actor Oscar is nothing short of deserving. But to say he steals the picture would be false, yes his role as Anton is brilliant, but Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin hold their own.The direction and cinematography is outstanding, but almost expected now from the Coens with their unique filmmaking style. Look, ultimately theirs nothing negative I have to say, it's a very well made story with well written characters. It broadened my horizons with cinema, had it not been for this movie I would of very likely not been interested in exploring westerns and other similar genres.Because of its impact on me, that totally justifies giving it a perfect rating."
abooodalalimi,"Aug 22, 2025",7/10,"The movie was perfect probably the fastest 2 hours in my life but the ending is one of the worst ending I ever saw I recommend watching it just don't expect the best ending I wish they could at least just maybe thought of a better ending at least but I guess it is what it is , if you like cowboys and killers and stuff then watch just don't expect the is good."
alibrahim1,"Feb 11, 2025",3/10,"Very disappointing and Overrated. So i waited 2 hours for this! Very frustrating!Even though the movie has strong performances (Brolin and Bardem), and great cinematography, and an intense atmosphere. However, it really fails to deliver a compelling narrative structure or meaningful resolution overall.Extremely slow paced, would have loved for closure. Very ambiguous. Also, the lack of character development!Things i dislike:1- The whole chunk from the movie is the conflict between Moss and Chigurh... Moss gets killed, WHY NOT SHOW IT!!?! Then why bother build the tension and the story so much around them at fist!! Disappointing! Should have showed the climax of the struggle that was built for a long time.2- Sheriff Tommy Lee jones
What's the point of the whole thing with him if he has ZERO effect on the narrative of the movie?So what did he do really? Nothing. Just some philosophical dialogue about how the world has become too violent for him.So, showing him from the beginning of the movie
just for that? He literally has ZERO contribution to the conflict that happened.Even during the investigation he appeared not interested and not invested in the conflict, what kind of sheriff is that!3- Tension without climaxYes, tension was built.. and it was extremely tense! But what happened at the end? Nothing
So no point in making the movie at the first place.4- ChigurhAmazing performance!! Just amazing! However, from the character standpoint. Would have loved to discover his motives and what made him a psycho! (Background)Anyways, I disliked the movie for these reasons. Yeah i get why people love it (fate and whatsoever)... but it's certainly not for me
The only thing i enjoyed was Bardem's performance.No story at all
No point
No Ending."
MajidS-650,"Oct 8, 2025",10/10,"A truly epic masterpiece, a slow chilling suspense with next to no music throughout the film is a rare sensation exclusive to this film, it captures the true essence of the 1980's neo western atmosphere, the acting is super and the pacing is sublime - Truly worthy of winning it's 4 oscars in a very competitive year back in 2007."
KamyarMatthew,"Nov 22, 2025",8/10,"In a world where fate is both silent and brutal, morality becomes a shadow.No Country for Old Men is a film that hums with quiet dread, the kind that settles in your chest long after the screen goes dark. It's a story where violence is almost invisible, yet omnipresent; where each choice, each glance, feels weighted by the inexorable hand of chance. My rating of 8 reflects a film that is profound, yet deliberately distant , an existential meditation rather than a conventional thriller.Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is terrifying not for his cruelty alone, but for the eerie logic he carries in his stillness. He isn't just a killer; he is a manifestation of entropy, a measure of life's arbitrary cruelty. Every deliberate step, every coin toss, reads less like a plot device and more like a philosophical question cast in flesh: what does justice mean when morality itself is collapsing?Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell, conversely, inhabits the world with the weariness of someone who has seen time slip past him. His introspection , the pauses, the quiet gaze into empty spaces , reveals the human cost of inevitability, the way conscience carries weight even when the world has lost its moral compass.Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss navigates a path of instinct, intellect, and desire, embodying the precarious human belief that skill and reason can outrun chaos. And yet the subtext whispers that hubris is no shield against the universe's impartial cruelty.Every frame, every silence, is a study in tension: not just external danger, but the internal reckoning of choice, consequence, and survival. The Coen brothers do not entertain; they illuminate the stark poetry of inevitability. This is cinema that asks you to listen between the gunshots, to read the spaces where human truth quietly trembles.In sum, No Country for Old Men is more than a story of crime , it is a philosophical parable on chance, morality, and the human condition. An 8, because it is brilliant, yet deliberately unyielding, leaving you to wrestle with questions it never answers.Kamyar Matthew, I write where films stop and the soul begins."
syre-24208,"May 5, 2023",7/10,"A thrilling movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. The plot is well-crafted and the acting is top-notch, particularly from Javier Bardem who delivers a haunting performance as the villain. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the bleak beauty of the Texan landscape. However, the film's ending may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied, as it leaves many questions unanswered. Additionally, the pacing can feel slow at times and the lack of a traditional soundtrack may not appeal to all audiences. Overall, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a solid movie that is worth watching, but falls just short of being a masterpiece."
1Genius_Gamer,"Nov 19, 2024",10/10,"No country for old men is a long movie made by Coen Brothers and its story is based on a book which its name is the same as the movie's name and it's written by Cormac Mc Carthy.The story is not a complicated one and I'll try to tell a bit about it without spoiling anything , a drug deal goes wrong, drug dealers kill each other, one of them escapes with 2 million dollars but he dies...
Another man who is a hunter and was a former soldier accidentally finds the money and he takes it for himself but then he finds out that a killer is after him and his money and he's going to kill everyone who stands in his way...
And there's a sheriff in this story who's the narrator...
The important thing about the movie is, unlike its simple storyline this movie has a lot of concepts that we can talk a lot about them; like the way that violence is growing in society, the personality of the killer which reminds me of the Joker character and a lot more things; I personally believe showing these details in the movie made No country for old men a perfect movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who like movies from this genre.In the end, thanks for reading my review."
Olek_G,"Nov 24, 2025",10/10,"What struck me most about No Country for Old Men is its stark, undecorated portrait of a world where evil often goes unpunished and justice returns to no one. The film shows how greed and the impulse to take what isn't yours can shatter not only your life but also the lives of those closest to you, no matter how clever you think you are.Roger Deakins turns the desert into a character of its own - stark, endless, and utterly unforgiving. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones ground the story with performances you can trust, every look and move loaded with weight. But Javier Bardem? He steals the show. Anton Chigurh is cold, methodical, and terrifyingly precise - a villain you can't look away from, and one that made his Oscar feel completely earned.The film's one notable ambiguity lies in Chigurh's motives. It's never entirely clear whether he's acting out of financial interest, loyalty to the crime syndicate, or simply his own cold, twisted sense of purpose. That mystery fuels the tension, but it can also leave viewers wanting a bit more context - a peek into why the most terrifying figure on screen does what he does.Ultimately, No Country for Old Men isn't just a crime thriller - it's a meditation on fate, morality, and the quiet terror of a world that refuses to bend to expectation. Brutal, intelligent, and unforgettable, it's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll."
kevencordoba,"May 27, 2017",9/10,"For the love of god, do not let the reviews from those who gave this a 1/10 discourage you from seeing this memorable film. They're just angry because they didn't understand the movie and think it's overrated. If anything it's underrated. I wasn't a fan of Joel and Ethan Coen before this film and even after I'm still not a huge fan. I am, however, a huge fan of the writer of the novel No Country For Old Men and this movie is very faithful to the novel and the Coen's captured the essence of the novel almost perfectly. This is a great action film with some of the most realistic shootouts I've seen in film. It's suspense and even humorous at times. Again, don't let those bad reviews decide for you that you already dislike this movie. The story this movie and book tells is worth it."
st-shot,"Nov 22, 2007",6/10,"The Coen brothers are on firmer and more familiar territory with this Texas noir based on the Cormac Mc Carthy novel. Trailer park resident Llewellyn Moss stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert and makes off with the fortune in cash. A machine like but philosophical psychopathic killer is soon in pursuit. An aging sheriff takes up pursuit of both with little success as bodies begin to litter the territory.The film is filled with some highly suspenseful moments and for the most part remains that way for much of the film. The pace maintains itself by shifting back and forth between three characters with a detour here and there to introduce other players and plot twists. The diversions and turns eventually become wearisome though and Country starts to slow down.No Country is vintage Coen. After the Big Lebowski (a worthy follow-up to their masterpiece Fargo) the brothers seemed to have lost their edge with four lackluster efforts. Country recalls their superb earlier works such as Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and Fargo and therein lies part of the problem. A lot of Country has scenes and characters directly lifted from these works.The Coen's are masters at oblique dialogue that gets to the heart of the matter and many scenes resonate with these elements giving them both tension and humor. Their originality and unpredictability of action and character can raise suspense in the most benign of settings. Their heroes and villains are complex. They are not 24-7 people of virtue or mindless cruelty. Their quirks flesh out and bring depth to their character thus increasing the possible directions of the plot.Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is a burned out Andy of Mayberry moving from middle age crisis to old age and the uncertainty of retirement, always a step behind the bad guys. Jones conveys his fatigue and dogged determination in a fine measured way. Josh Brolin is even better as Moss who goes to great lengths to hold onto the money. Brolin, who stole acting honors in American Gangster as a corrupt jersey cop does so here as well as a stoic Texan. Based on these two roles alone he could be Americas best working actor. Woody Harrelson is badly miscast as a contract killer in a throw away role.What ultimately makes No Country for Old Men a disappointment is the handling of the villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The film, grounded in a dusty realism slowly starts to fall apart as Chigurh moves across the landscape like Boris Karloff offing locals with an unconcealed customized weapon. Even after a dozen people have been eliminated by Chigurh you get the impression that only Sheriff Bell is looking for him since Chigurh has no problem moving freely about spreading mayhem. The fascinating character that Chigurh is (he seems to be searching for the meaning of life as well as the stolen money) at the film's beginning degenerates into a Schwarzenegian Terminator manqué by the final reel and this strains the credulity of the movie beyond its breaking point.With Country the brothers Coen may be out of the rut that plagued there last few works but their wheels are still spinning."

A Cold and Confusing Film That Didn't Resonate With MeReview Text:
No Country for Old Men is technically impressive and well-acted, but for me, it was a cold, emotionless, and confusing experience. The narrative felt scattered and lacked cohesion, the characters seemed more symbolic than human, and the ending didn't offer resolution-only a deeper sense of meaninglessness. While some viewers may appreciate its philosophical undertones and dark atmosphere, I couldn't connect with it. I was hoping for a clearer, more human story.Suggested Rating: 4/10."
act_of_bob,"Mar 17, 2009",9/10,"This film really gripped me, but not in any spectacular way, more for the un/ethical values that often creep through the film at quite inopportune times. Despite the violence -although credibly a restrained use of foul-language- the film cannot really be said to be brutal, and instead examines the sinful natures of two men, who both mete out the seven equally, and never really balance the moral with the ethical value of life over the pursuit of death; instead they pursue their own agendas without regard to society or the law. By the close of the film it could equally be argued the law is culpable in sharing the pie of sin.Another intriguing element is that none of the main protagonists actually meet face-to-face, despite the cat and mouse battle between Bardem and Brolin. This may reflect the changing state of crime in the US, at least on film. In classic cowboy film the two protagonists would ultimately end face to face, or be overwhelmed by the forces of good and admonished from our conscience. But in NCFOM the law in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones is reduced to an ineffective theologian mulling over the changing nature of society in the face of law, and as such most of the revealing discourse comes through Jones.There are subtle elements to the film that carry the tale beyond the end, and often cause you to view the film to reason the logic for such simple elements such as when both characters desperately seek to purchase a shirt to evade a critical moment. All of which proves Joel and Ethan Cohen are becoming incredible talents in Hollywood, and their determination to do something new with script often translates into intriguing and dramatic film."
firesights,"Nov 20, 2007",9/10,"No Country for Old Men is a movie that will most likely flop in theaters. It is not the kind of flick you will hear people raving about (unless you have a lot of movie-addicts as friends) and flocking to the production in large numbers. It is not the kind of movie that most people will want to see over and over again. But this is also perhaps the precise reason why it is such a thrilling, fantastic film that will garner ridiculous adoration from a subset of viewers who don't like their action movies spoon fed to them by Hollywood with Will Smith delivering witty one-liners throughout. No Country for Old Men stands on its own as one of the finest action movies ever produced, though to call it simply an ""action"" movie drastically understates the ambitious reach of author Cormac McCarthy and producers Joel and Ethan Coen.Set in the Southwestern United States, No Country is a story about Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who finds $2 million in cash in a drug deal in the middle of the desert, with no one around to guard it except several decaying bodies. Being a poor man clutching to existence in a remote part of the country, he decides to keep the money and hope for the best. When Anton Chigurh, played unsettlingly by Javier Bardem, comes looking for the money, the entire plot becomes ""a mess,"" as Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) succinctly puts it. This movie is the opposite of a B-rate slaughterhouse of gore and torture. It chooses to seethe, to ooze tension and leave our imaginations to do the worst. Rather than club you over the head with grisly pictures, the machinations of the Coen brothers are carefully sculpted to extract the maximum amount of impact from each confrontation while keeping the gore to an essential minimum.Part of what makes No Country so brilliant is how focused each scene appears to us, how they delight in the subtle nuances of character, portraying them as common individuals who are mostly clueless to deal with the changing forces around them. The austere humor of each individual echoes this, as they deliver their own guileless assessments of life and love, delivered in a Southwestern slang that many will mistake for a lack of wisdom. Yet each role here is superbly designed to beg for reflection, to ponder the choices they made, and to examine their own flaws and virtues. In short, every character means something to the plot, and the ramifications of what happens to them are always noticed and felt by the viewer. When one dies, it releases a torrent of emotion that will leave us feeling bereft of something substantial.And that is perhaps the most significant departure from the typical movie of No Country for Old Men. The action scenes here are visceral, they are gripping, and they are well-designed, the same as many other films appearing this year in theaters. What is different here is intuition of the directors, who realize that silence in a gunfight can provide much more tension than a constant rain of bullets. The most unbearable moments in No Country are the seconds before the trigger is pulled, where life and death are temporarily suspended. After each confrontation, an audible gasp is almost necessary. This film is equally as unnerving because the next battle is always around the corner  if not with guns, then with words, and if not with words, with the idea of how to deal with death, life, and our past.It is in these somber ruminations that No Country is saved from being a nihilistic retelling of fate. Without the distantly observant comments made by Tommy Lee Jones' character (Bell), the earnest method by which Moss (Brolin) moves through the scenes with an uneasy balance between fear and arrogance, or the chilling ideology of Chigurh (Bardem), this movie would have been another two hours of mindless bloodletting, as desolate as the landscape. Instead, No Country is full of choices, consequences, and the motives that drive us, a film that stands tall in a sea of much poorer clones. Even the ending, which may leave some scratching their head, and others angered, is as devastatingly stark and unapologetic as the rest of the production, offering no ""feel better"" pill, only the vague ideas of a desperate situation, and a person who has simply had enough. It is potentially the most unnerving quality in the entire film: The ending is simply too realistic for its own good, departing from underneath our conscience with only a few words to see us home. What is not spoken aloud is what makes No Country for Old Men a classic. Hard to watch, and easy to enjoy."
loganschainker,"Jul 5, 2022",10/10,"There is not a single flaw I can think of with this film. It is one of the most meticulously crafted and perfected pieces of art ever put to screen. The Coens directed this film with such mastery, precision and restraint. I don't think I've ever seen a better example of less is more in a film. It would be a sin not to mention the cinematography. Roger Deakins once again knocks it out of the park with his beautiful frames. He is without a doubt my favorite cinematographer. The acting is superb. Javier Bardem was absolutely terrifying as Anton Chigurh, truly one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones both give the greatest performances of their careers. This film is a masterclass in tension. This is best complemented by the use of silence. There is no music in this film. (Apart from the end credits of course) Which makes for some of the most anxiety-inducing scenes I have ever witnessed. But at it's core, the film is about the inevitably of death and the passing of time. I will not spoil it but this film contains one of the most beautifully ambiguous endings ever, it fully contributes to its themes. No Country For Old Men is another one of my indisputable all time favorites."
gelatin25,"Nov 28, 2007",6/10,"It definitely had its redeeming qualities, but overall I was rather let down and found it to be somewhat over-hyped. I expected this to be the Coen Brothers masterpiece thus far, a new level for them, but it still seemed to be the same old same old. Now Javier Bardem (where did this guy come from??) plays an excellent villain, you can see it in his eyes alone. He's completely ruthless and without a conscience to the point that it's just funny. And that's vintage Coen Brothers right there- this kind of black humor. There's some great dialogue, and even some classic moments of stylized violence that give it real potential. Watch for one memorable scene involving a very explosive diversion this villain creates outside a small-town pharmacy. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and taking place in the southwest, the Coen Brothers, as they did in ""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" seem to rely too much on southern stereotypes for humor's sake rather than a true knowledge and understanding of the south. Still worth seeing."
Blue-Grotto,"Nov 5, 2017",10/10,"""You can't help but wonder how the old timers would operate in these times,"" narrates Sheriff Ed in thick and alluring southwestern drawl. We soon find out exactly what he means by ""these times."" Llewelyn is hunting in a remote and arid grassland, stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and manages to get away with a bundle of cash. While Llewelyn covers his tracks, keeps his mouth shut and is smart, tough and resourceful, he may not be prepared for what is coming for him in the form of tracker Anton Chigurh. A person without empathy is more dangerous than a coward, and Chigurh is cold, cruel, relentless and methodical. He figures out not just where people are, but where they will be. As Chigurh pursues Llewelyn, others are close behind including Sheriff Ed, a drug cartel, other trackers and Llewelyn's girlfriend, only a few of whom are cut out for this game of cat and mouse.Ten years after the release of the film and it is well understood how it made or sealed the careers of Javier Bardem (Chigurh), Josh Brolin (Llewelyn), Tommy Lee Jones (Ed) and not least of all the Coens who are some of the best directors in the business. Here the Coens are firing on all cylinders. The film is complex, thrilling and multi-layered. It is full of great lines. Its occasional extreme brutality is offset with wit, charm and humor. Adding to the compelling characters are amazing performances by Jones, Bardem and Brolin. They are perfectly cast. The voice of Jones alone is authentic and enthralling. Bardem is truly chilling. He speaks, moves and acts like a ghost. There are beautiful shots of the southwestern landscape in the morning light and intriguing close-ups of the characters. There is delight even in little details; a coin flip, a drink of milk, a cat and the banter of minor characters. Such attention to detail is a mark of the brilliance of the Coens. The film is set in the 1970s and is based on a story by Cormac McCarthy. This is one of my favorite films (top 20) of all time."
majesty327,"Nov 12, 2013",9/10,"As a large proponent of ""Show, don't tell"", I'd say that this is in one of my top-ten movies. It's a marvel in the power understatement. Just simple actions like picking up the casing after shooting a deer make characters seem that much more real and deep. The rolling valleys, and corporate roads perfectly capture both the identity and the plight of the modern South-west. The lack of music and the addition of little background noises like the commotion in the streets, and the blowing of the wind make this movie almost seem like it's real. I felt like I was really there the entire movie. Is there plot holes? Maybe. This is a film that you have to pay attention to and pick up on the subtleties. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I'll leave up to you. For me at least, my favorite things about this movie is the atmosphere and the subtlety. The actors also put in good performances, with Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh ultimately being the character that everyone remembers and talks about. I highly recommend this movie to people who can overcome its slow pace and general lack of explicit explanation. It's a 9.5/10, an excellent movie. And no, I don't pretend to ""get"" this movie. Whether you do or don't is not a sign of your intelligence, so much as how much you think this movie is worth getting into. It's not a fast-moving-action-thriller, but it's a great suspense film with near flawless sound design and cinematography."
Jonny_Numb,"Dec 8, 2007",8/10,"At various moments in ""No Country for Old Men,"" we are shown rusty, weather-beaten windmills squeaking in the dry desolation of the American Southwest, doing their 360-degree revelations in the passing wind. This imagery ties in nicely with the elliptical nature of the characters and plot (based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy), but also shows Joel and Ethan Coen coming full circle within their own career, as this film plays like a ""desert noir"" companion to their debut feature, ""Blood Simple"" (1985).The brothers' requisite plot devicea large sum of money being stolen and sought afterfinds an Everyman foil in Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens upon a massacre site where a drug deal went awry, and makes off with a satchel of cash pried from a dead man's hands. His wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is skeptical, and it is not until Llewelyn commits an act of charity that he finds himself in a relentless chase to outrun the innumerable factions seeking the cash. As in McCarthy's novel, these factions are vaguely defined at best, save for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a seemingly indestructible boogeyman who possesses no loyalty, and only the faintest trace of humanity (some of his potential victims are absolved by the luck of a coin toss). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (one of the ""old men"" of the title, played with depth and grace by Tommy Lee Jones) is the outsider intermediary, whose own jaded feelings toward the inexplicable senselessness of crime in America is magnified in the increasingly nihilistic pursuit between Chigurh and Moss.""No Country"" is like a symphony of aesthetics, with the Coens showing an affinity for wide-angle photography (captured by DP Roger Deakins) of the vast American Southwest; close-ups of faces of a variety of ages, weathered by age or fatigue or shrapnel; sound-effects editing so razor-precise that the squeaking of an oxygen valve or the clicking of a safety-catch in an otherwise silent scene is enough to inspire chills. Also worth noting is the absence of musical score, with Carter Burwell's orchestrations swelling only a few moments after the end credits have started to roll.I find it refreshing that, in our era of cinematic spectacle, replete with CGI-candy, that ""No Country"" derives much of its impact from the characters themselves, often filmed in the aforementioned close-ups that makes their dialogues resonate with a profoundalmost meditativeurgency, conveyed wonderfully in the subtly understated performances. This is an interesting adaptive choice on the Coens' part, since many of their films take a parodic approach toward ""country folk"" as witless yokels designed as vessels for comedy. And while ""No Country"" finds some clever comic asides (Moss's exchange with a testy American border guard is a gem), the tone is that of pervasively ominous uncertaintythe tags of ""hero"" and ""villain"" are not easily applied, and the Coens are not above showing the moral ambiguity of their characters with a flatly objective eye.And the performances are indicative of this flat objectivity. Talented character actor Josh Brolin (""The Goonies""; ""Grindhouse"") embodies the quirks, flaws, and traits (both heroic and anti-heroic) of Llewelyn; Bardem is a towering iceberg of intimidation, whose Chigurh becomes an almost-infallible extension of some mythic desert dweller (existing solely in a world of self-obligation and passive violence); Jones brings a worldly wisdom and depth to Ed Tom, the glue that bonds the narrative; English actress Macdonald (probably best known for ""Trainspotting"") slips into a Southern accent and conveys the necessary fearand finally, acceptanceof being an unwitting pawn in a situation beyond her control.In the end, there is a paradoxical thematic synthesis as two characters ""walk away"" from obligation and into a future that is, at best, uncertain (the characters ""unite"" in a slow fade); and while Bell's closing recollection of a dream veers into Oscar-nod territory, it perfectly resolves ""No Country for Old Men,"" a story so open-ended and incendiary that its grislier moments could easily be culled from today's national headlines. The movie may be set in 1980, but its parable-like presentation will prove timeless. One of 2007's best."
jordan2240,"Nov 22, 2007",8/10,"I've seen all of the Coen Bros. films, and have had no trouble following the story-lines - until now. I was left with far too many questions in the end to give this film a high rating. I tried to like it, given it's critical reviews, but found portions of it rather boring, and also couldn't figure out how certain characters got involved in the story at all. They often seemingly appeared out of nowhere, leaving you to ponder who they were and what relationship they had to other characters as the movie rolled on. And the ending has been well-documented. I would guess most viewers basically zone out at that point anticipating the next bit of action, and the next bit of action is the credits scrolling by. Fargo and The Big Lebowski remain on top of my Coen Bros. list, with No Country perhaps bringing up the rear. I have no trouble with movies that reqire some thought, but am not a big fan of those that simply try to confuse you."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oct 30, 2021",9/10,"'No Country For Old Men (2007)' has a tangible grit to it; you can almost feel the very fabric of the film itself. It's a calm and methodical meditation on the changing nature of both crime itself and the world at large (with a focus on America, in particular). It maintains its slow pace even during its bluntly violent action sequences, which are often genuinely intense. The piece is surprisingly suspenseful, providing proper thrills alongside its pseudo philosophical pondering. It doesn't spoon-feed you anything; you have to work to understand its plot and, even, characters, which are both relatively elusive and purposefully amoral. The flick makes no judgements on its players, even though some are truly despicable, and it doesn't provide easy explanations or motivations for some of their actions. This makes for an engaging experience that encourages rather deep thinking. The movie isn't as straightforward as its pretty by-the-numbers set-up would suggest. It undercuts itself at, arguably, its most important moment, subverting expectation with an unconventional yet shockingly effective final third. It really is brilliant. The film feels substantial, a resonant commentary on the ever-evolving yet always cyclical nature of violence and the pure randomness of fate. It stays with you for quite a while after it's over, both providing in-the-moment excitement and provoking retroactive reflection. It's a confident and considered affair right from the start. It's wonderful. 9/10."
matthewpr06,"Feb 6, 2008",7/10,"I've seen this film twice now and although I enjoyed and appreciated it the first time around, I was less forgiving about it after a second viewing. I personally think the Coen Brothers are brilliant filmmakers but No Country just doesn't work for me. First thing that bugs me is the folly of the films supposed primary theme; chance. Seriously, all the coin flipping is so blatant and un-subtle that surely it can't be what the film is about, can it? I've always found the Coen's work to be very refined, so to be bashed over the head with something so clichéd as a-man-flipping-a-coin-to-represent-chance just doesn't seem quite right for me.Obviously, No Country isn't a bad film. Technically it's brilliant, in terms of cinematography; shot selection, lighting and framing everything on screen is impeccably done. Also, the acting is superb; Bardem's Chigurh is instantly iconic. Brolin's LIewelyn (surely a name that should be used more in movies) is strong but vulnerable, unapologetically simple, yet layered. Equally, Tommy Lee Jones's Ed Tom is an interesting and enigmatic character. However therein is one of the main problems I have with this film; the Ed Tom story thread just doesn't fit in this film; thematically and tonally it's at odds with the main story and all it does is succeed in giving the film a bloated feel. For me, it's a case of a good performance that has been added to the detriment of the rest of the film.So what is No Country For Old Men about? It can't be about chance as that is too obvious. It can't be about getting old because it has so little to say. Is it about the insignificance of man off-set against the indeterminably powerful presence of nature and the relentless passage of time? Perhaps, but the Coen's have never been complex and pretentious just for the sake of being complex and pretentious.I can appreciate the fact that No Country is a good film, well made with some great composite elements. However I don't feel it has the vibrancy of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, or the humour of Fargo, or the intelligence of Barton Fink. For me, this film is an un-satisfying mix of art house film-making and mainstream marketing, which benefits from great performances and an interesting central story but is damaged by poor choices in terms of muddled themes, sound design and the inclusion of an unnecessary sub-plot in what otherwise would have been a brilliant film."
jkelly5352,"May 13, 2022",9/10,"No Country for Old Men presents not only a well-made story, but a beautiful commentary about evil in the world. Anton Chigurh is one of the most well-crafted villains in cinematic history. His motivation along with his methods are all so ambiguous, the story's direction remains unclear through about the entire movie and the ending leaves just enough doors open to keep the film in your head for a long time."
dr_foreman,"Nov 10, 2007",7/10,"I'm maybe not the best person to review No Country for Old Men. I long ago became tired of movies about assassins, drugs, shootings, and suitcases full of money. I feel as though Hollywood has been recycling the same seedy crime material for years - and so have the Coen brothers. Movies like this one, Fargo, Blood Simple, Sin City, Pulp Fiction, and Smokin' Aces all seem to come from the same mold, and that mold is getting mighty overused, in my opinion.On the plus side, I think the Coen brothers are uniquely gifted at presenting this kind of material. Indeed, No Country for Old Men is, in many ways, one of the most beautiful and suspenseful films that I've seen in a long time. It's full of striking images of the desert, interesting point-of-view shots, and incredibly intimate close-ups of actors with fascinating faces. Even the sound effects are great; they're loud, vivid and realistic, and they genuinely enhance the action.But beyond all that surface glitz, what is the movie about? I never really understood or cared for any of the characters. The protagonist is unsympathetic from the beginning, for instance. Tommy Lee Jones, meanwhile, gives a good performance but seems to be virtually trapped in a subplot. Furthermore, his ""deep"" dialog did very little for me - ""mock profundity"" is perhaps an apt description. The villain is great, I suppose, but once you've seen him kill twelve people, there's not much point in seeing him kill a thirteenth, is there?I don't want to bury this movie, because it's very well done. But I'm annoyed that, at usual, film critics and students are heaping an avalanche of praise on a movie that's really violent, really strange, and really alienating. Yeah, sure, it plays with narrative conventions in interesting ways. But it doesn't take true genius to frustrate an audience's expectations, and storytelling gimmicks alone can't save a story that's so barren. I suppose you could hunt for deeper meaning - as people tend to do on message boards - but I don't think there's much to find. The movie is a beautiful toy, and not too much more."
ScottBang,"Nov 21, 2007",N/A,"I really really hate this film and I'm flabbergasted at the amount of alleged love for it. I still refuse to believe that some of these positive reviews here are legitimate. Still, maybe my expectations were skewed going in to it. I was expecting a ""Walking Tall"" meets ""Fargo"" movie, a quirky and intense tough guy crime drama that would leave me satisfied. This movie and especially its resolution are the least satisfying in recent memory.I've read the elitist argument about deeper themes and beautiful cinematography but without a story to pull it all together, who cares? To me, a movie is primarily about character and story. Even great performances and direction can't save a bad concept or story. This story is ugly on paper and it's despicable on screen. Some of the spoilers have been disgusted here so, there's no need to rehash them. Needless to say, killing characters may haunt and disturb the viewer but it's cheap emotion that normal movie goers will resent. The piecemeal dialogue is also off putting. Every exchange seems to be a poor parody tribute to Pulp Fiction style of dialog. Tommy Lee Jones' character being the worst ""witty"" offender.I guarantee you that word of mouth from average movie goers will be quite poor for this trash. The only good thing is that after, people will feel truly betrayed by the critical consensuses and praise for it. This will farther erode trust in opinions of the critics. Making critics even more useless is never a bad thing. When I see the TV commercials for Old Country and the quotes they use, I resent every word and every critic mentioned. After others waste time and effort with this movie, I won't be the only resentful one.Terrible, terrible movie."
ivygraves,"Jul 12, 2021",10/10,"Javier Bardem is absolutely fabulous. He makes acting look so easy. The intensity he brings to the screen, will scare you to the bone. You feel every inch of his anger with every breath he takes yet his anger is so calm which makes no sense but it's the only way to describe it.Josh Brolin is certainly no slouch in this movie, he is a natural born cowboy and you feel his struggle. The journey he strives for to protect himself and his wife.You will not be disappointed, it's a must see be sure to bring your boots and cowboy hat and in the words of Javier Bardem ""don't put the coin in your pocket with the other coins or it's not a lucky coin anymore it just becomes a coin like the others""Bang! Bang!"
Andrew_H_Neal,"Oct 30, 2023",10/10,"I always go back to this film when I want to get lost in the perfectly crafted story. The plot is simplicity itself, and on the surface, so are many of the characters, at least, in the world they live in. But in true Coen Brother's fashion, each and every character that graces the screen has depth, authenticity, humanity, and complexity, creating a vivid and immersive tapestry of human need, human weakness, and the inevitably of everything including death. Actually, Carla Jean's mom may be the only exception to that now that I think of it! But this story does no apologize to anyone for what it is - a window into the world we live in, where good people aren't rewarded for being good and bad people aren't punished for being bad. This is a film about people in a cruel world fulfilling their roles as part of something larger and less meaningful than their individual lives. And when the credits roll, we know the dust does not settle. Nobody has really changed, or been surprised or will even remember we were watching. And I love it."

yashdubey-84644,"Jun 19, 2022",10/10,Although this movie may look like a western genre at starting but develops with the characters and story itself.No country for for old men is not a typical thriller movie made for the entertainment but for understanding of the viewers.The strongest part of the this movie was it's epic screenwriting and direction. Although some scenes may look or feel off the track.In short this movie is great peice of art with a serious masterclass performances.
cricketbat,"Aug 18, 2023",8/10,"No Country for Old Men is a film that really makes you think. It's not entirely clear why the Coen Brothers made all the decisions they did but, much like their other works, this movie makes you believe that there is purpose behind every line, every shot, and every edit. The first time I saw this film, I was frustrated with how it ended. I still am, but to a lesser degree now, because the slow & methodical journey this drama provides is more important than the destination. Plus, Anton Chigurh is truly terrifying. It's incredible how suspenseful this film is without a score and without much dialogue."
davidmvining,"Feb 16, 2024",10/10,"This is probably the purest genre exercise to win Best Picture since The Silence of the Lambs. It's all tension, quietly assembled and ready to break out into violence at any moment. This is a masterful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy by Joel and Ethan Coen, finding the little slices of black, deadpan, and offbeat comedy here and there, but mostly this is a dead stare of a threat against the audience's nerves. Told precisely both from a screenplay point of view as well as visually, No Country for Old Men is the stillest rollercoaster that gets the heart pumping.A drug deal goes wrong in the hinterlands of the Texas border county of Terrell County in 1980. Upon the aftermath comes Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a welder everyman who finds two million dollars in cash along with a dying cartel member. His humanity overcomes him, and he returns to the site to give the dying man water hours later, getting found out and starting a chase for the money. On his tail is the psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who uses an air pressure cannister and a heavily silenced shotgun to bring death to anyone in his path, but only by chance. He has this tic of deciding to let people go based on the results of a coin toss. A step or two behind the whole mess is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who wants to help, wants to protect Llewelyn and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), and simply does not understand the senseless violence breaking out around him.What is surprising about the film really is how still and quiet everything is. When Llewelyn comes across the aftermath of the bloodshed, the camera quietly pans as he walks through the results of the massacre, but the overall situation has this threat that we can't escape as audience members, and this is effectively how the film starts (it really starts with Chigurh murdering a sheriff's deputy coldly and violently, helping to create that sense of danger as well). There's very little overactive camera movement (when Llewelyn is running in the dark there's an accentuated camera shake that feels digitally enhanced), and it helps create this sense of unease in pretty much every scene. Whether we're looking at Llewelyn and Carla Jean sitting on the couch or Chigurh holding a shotgun to someone sitting opposite to him, the same, cool approach to visual storytelling is applied and it creates this sense of unease the violence could breakout at any moment.That's not to say that the film is uniformly tense. It's only mostly tense. The tension is broken up mainly by tiny parts with characters who show up for a scene or two, like the old lady who owns the small Del Rio hotel that Llewelyn holes up in with particular views on how many beds are appropriate for a man alone to have in his hotel room. These little interactions are peppered throughout, especially in the film's first half, and really do help alleviate the tension from time to time.However, the chase between Llewelyn and Chigurh simply will not stop until one of them is dead, and the grounded, quiet approach to the filmmaking around it makes every encounter in the latter half a matter of life or death as Chigurh kills those in his way, those who see him, and always getting closer to Llewelyn as he gets closer to the Mexican border and even crosses it. It's a cat and mouse game where Llewelyn gets a leg up only to lose it to Chigurh a little bit later, back and forth with moments around hiding the cash in a hotel or noting a shadow under a door. The stillness just gets to me as we're constantly waiting for violence to erupt.There's a late break in the tension with the introduction of Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), a fellow assassin sent by Chigurh's employer to clip his wings, having a couple of conversations here and there as he helps provide further context to Chigurh's propensity for violence. He's a breath in between larger set pieces, and the movie still doesn't relent.The film ends with violence, of course, but also providing Ed room to face his own mortality, having helped nothing along the way, and reflecting on how his father will be waiting for him in a mountain pass up ahead. There's a reflection on how violence has always been with us, perhaps on a bit of nostalgia for a time that never quite existed, and a concern that really, things might still be getting worse and what can one man do against that tide?So, it's a genre exercise that's almost painfully tense for very long stretches. It has moments of deeply black and offbeat comedy. It's got something on its mind that it conveys well. This is just great entertainment at the movies, and it's the kind of film the Academy wanted to award with Oscars through the 00s. This wasn't a terrible decade for that award, overall, it seems."
tedg,"Dec 10, 2007",N/A,"How can I be disappointed by a good movie?I suppose I should say at the outset that this IS a good movie. You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.McCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.McCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.But its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.The other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That ""viewing"" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice.Its all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.So why am I unhappy?Because the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.Here, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled.Yes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for? PT Andersen? Sean Penn? When the Coens simply rely on their competence, they steal from us the things that they uniquely can do: confabulate and confuse reality. Now that Woody is all but retired, we need them more than ever, Dude.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
carsonpayne-66437,"Aug 22, 2022",9/10,"I really enjoyed this movie, so much so that it has caused me to reflect multiple times on its story and ending. I appreciated that there were so many twists in the movie that almost felt natural yet shocking. That is a very hard thing to do. The story continued and I never thought to myself, I don't like where this is heading.The antagonist is eerily realistic which added to the character development throughout the film. The acting was superb and the filmography was wholesome between the gratuitous landscape shots and fading transitions.Something I also loved about this movie is how well it used violence to convey its story. The violence, although sometimes gory, was never self-satisfying or gratuitous. The disturbing scenes always lended it's hand to the story as masterfully as a Tarantino film."
Willemite,"Feb 10, 2008",8/10,"No Country for Old Men was an engaging and interesting film, but I was not as taken with it as most seem to have been.Plot-wise, it is primarily a chase film. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) having made off with found drug money flees; psycho-killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) chases him; Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) chases Anton; Carson Wells, (Woody Harrelson) in the employ of the money side of the drug deal, chases the money; drug dealers chase Llewellyn. Can Moss get away with the money? He concocts a devious scheme for hiding the cash, but is not clever enough to figure out soon enough how Anton can find him so easily. He is smart enough to know his wife will need protecting but then sends her to a place where she is certain to be found.Anton is a bad-hair boogie-man, in the mold of Jason, Freddie or Michael Meyers, maniacally intent on retrieving his money, determined to kill any who have wronged him or even to have gotten in his way, and willing to lay waste any unfortunate enough to be nearby. Doesn't he catch up with Llewellyn rather quicker than seems likely for anyone not blessed with symbolic DNA? Isn't it at least a little suspicious that he knows exactly what medication to take from the pharmacy, and is able to deliver exact dosages? And how about his reaction when faced with a compound fracture at the end? Grits his teeth, wraps the sucker up and walks off into the distance like any good boogie-man might. Yet he cloaks his actions under the guise of having ""a code."" This ""code"" seems to impress some of those around him. Carson Wells and the sheriff both refer to it. A code that allows a madman to kill based on a coin toss is crying out for a rewrite. That Anton takes sadistic pleasure in bullying those to whom he offers the coin only reinforces that he is a nut-job. Does fate take pleasure in our demise? Not likely. Adding personality to Anton makes him less a symbol and more of a monster. The scene in which Carla Jean refuses to play, insisting that Anton was responsible for his actions and was not merely an instrument of fate, reinforces this. (A switch from the book, by the way. She accepts and loses in the novel.) So is Anton a symbol for fate or just a crazy guy? Both maybe, but if so, that muddies the issues.McCarthy's an adherent to the ""Life's a bitch and then you die"" school, with a career-long focus on violence in human existence. He sees things getting progressively worse. The violence here is more mindless than in his prior work. The message comes across that things have changed for the worse within the last generation. That probably references the disrespect for authority that grew out of the 1960s, the growth in the drug trade that happened in the 1970s, and by implication the spectacular growth of private gun use. To see where he is going with this, I suggest reading his award winning The Road, an incredible book about a post-apocalyptic America.The Coens offer snippets of their very welcome humor. Llewellyn appearing at the border crossing in a bathrobe was wonderful as was the scene in which he appears in the same outfit at a clothing store and the clerk asks in a deadpan how the boots were working out. Woody Harrelson gets a few nice comedic lines as does Josh Brolin. While no one gets to say ""I think I'm gonna barf,"" there are enough small yucks to lighten the overall emotional load.Could either Llewellyn or Anton bleed as much as they had and not go into shock? I don't know, but it certainly was impressive seeing them self-medicate.I liked the cinematography, the beautiful opening serenity that would play host to the high body count to come, the claustrophobia of the hotels, some very nice in-town shots looking down at the streets and storefronts.Acting-wise, Josh Brolin was perfect as the everyman who sees his opportunity and takes it, then trying to cope with the results. I would have liked to have seen him get a nomination. TLJ played, well, TLJ. It seemed to me that this is the same role he has played in many, many films. Of course, I really like TLJ, so I do not know if this is a bad thing. Kelly McDonald (Carla Jean Moss) earned her money for her scene with Javier Bardem. Riveting. Harrelson was fun. But I do not get what all the excitement is for Bardem. Yes, he was effective in portraying a nut-job. Should Ah-nold have gotten an Oscar nomination for his homicidal robot? That was effective too. Bardem is arguably one of the brightest acting lights of our generation. Before Night Falls and The Sea Inside show his unmistakable genius. But the role as written is confusing. Is he a symbol or a person? The role does not really offer all that much range, in my humble opinion. Yes, he is scary. He uses silence effectively. And...So what are we to take from this movie? Life is ultra-violent and tough noogies? When your number is up, your number is up? Cormac needs to get out more. One need not go along with McCarthy's dark view of life to enjoy the film, and I did enjoy it quite a bit. I am a fan of the Coens. I love their sense of humor, particularly. But I do not believe that this film is their best work. Nor do I believe that it merits a best picture nomination. I know this puts me in a minority. It is an interesting film, dark yet amusing, and I would recommend it. But somehow it is not, to my mind, at the top tier."
DaveDiggler,"Mar 28, 2008",10/10,"""No Country for Old Men"" has it all. It's a chase film, but it's also subdued with symbolism and subtly. The acting is top notch and everybody has heard of Javier Bardem' great performance, but I think the real standout comes from Josh Brolin- in a career year- as Llewelyn Moss. Tom Lee Jones gives a powerhouse performance in subtly which only fits the nature and the tone of the film. Kelly McDonald is fantastic as Llewelyn' wife. When those two share a scene we really get a great understanding of their relationship in just a few moments here and there. Woody Haralson will remind you why he's an actor with a very good performance as a bounty hunter.The film starts and ends with Tommy Lee Jones' character, Ed Tom Bell. He has been a Sheriff since he was 25 years old with a history of lawmen dating back to his grandfather. Late in his career and late in life Ed Tom struggles with his past, future and legacy. He always questions whether or not the old timers would be proud of him because he's not proud of himself. He feels as if the world is changing; the violence is changing; man is changing and he can't keep up anymore. He's being passed by, by the younger man much like his dream with his younger father. Ed Tom is slowing down and the people he's chasing are moving faster until they stop and start a fire. Only then does he catch up. Once he get's there he knows he'll face something he doesn't understand and he'll have to put his motto at risk: ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" The evil he chases is cunning, smart, dark, and almost invisible until the final moments where fate steps in and delivers what's coming.As Bell is the focus of the film, Anton Chigurh, is the driving force in the film. His evil is destructive, it's overwhelming, it's senseless, and it's the fate of a coin toss. Anton' evil is best shown in a gas station scene where he subtly threatens the life of a gas station proprietor. The dialogue in the scene is incredible and it's the Coen' at their best. After the gas station proprietor infuriates Chigurh, because of his stupid questions, Anton decides to let fate step in and settle the dispute in a coin toss. As he crinkles up a candy wrapper, and lets it go, it becomes out of the hands of Chigurh. Fate has stepped in and the coin that has been traveling for 22 years is now here and that will decide whether the man lives or dies. It's his call and its either heads or tails. Chigurh can't call it for him, but he is his fate since he and the coin arrived at the same time. Chigurh simply doesn't care what the result is, but there has to be a result. Another great scene which shows Chigurh' Grim Reaper like evil is where one man watches another man die right in front of him at the hands of Chigurh. The man absurdly asks; ""Are you going to kill me?"" and Chigurh turns around and looks right into his eyes with a grin on his face and responds with an absurd question of his own, ""Do you see me?"" Moss is a simple man. A Vietnam War veteran. A man with a determination to find a way out of the life he currently inhabits as greed and fortune take over his fate. He tries to run. He tries to get away and live happily ever after and he believes he will even after he is ""immobilized"" by a gun shot wound from Chigurh. Like any person, Moss follows mans evil on a hunting trip as he tracks down the blood trail of a wounded dog. He follows the trail back and finds a slaughtering and Mexican Drug deal gone horribly wrong. Moss finds a man in need of water and he tells him he ""ain't got no water."" He smartly figures out there has to be money somewhere and figures one man was left and ran off. So he searches out for the ""last man standing,"" leaving the other man dying of thirst. Moss comes to a shade tree and through his eyes we can see a figure next to the tree. He waits for movement, and then he walks to the tree and finds a dead man with a satchel full of money. His fate doesn't involve a coin toss, but rather a satchel full of money and a transponder. This will bring Chigurh to Moss.The films end will leave viewers dissatisfied because the final act of the film is quite different than the first two acts. The final act isn't shot in the vast, empty hot lands of western Texas, but in an urbanized environment in the city. This goes well with the change of Bell' character. The terrain is not his costume. It's not his country. The final act is fast paced unlike the first two. There are no horses. There are more than pistols- machine guns. The violence is no longer shown. It's shown through a spilt milk bowl or Chigurh checking his boots. The violence takes a backstage seat where the first two acts are loaded with violence pushing on excessive. As the film unravels like the candy wrapper, Bell's fate steps in. He goes back to the big crime scene. He sees and knows what's on the other side of that door. He knows he is putting his soul at hazard. He's pushing his chips to the middle of the table and he enters in the face of evil where fate takes over."
mukfire,"Nov 23, 2007",6/10,"What is all the hype about? An eight point nine IMDb rating as of 11-23-07? Can't anyone see the emperor has no clothes here? I went to this movie based on the IMDb rating and the fact that it was a Coen Brothers movie, but I have to say I wasted 8 bucks and could've waited for the DVD. I was ready for a good, satisfying story of underdog revenge (the way it was marketed) and ended up with ""why old men shouldn't retire, because it was just as bad in the old days as it is now."" Josh Brolin could've been another Russell Crowe (a la Gladiator - so good was his performance), but it wasn't to be.I felt like I was sold a bill of goods. To blame is both the marketeers and the ignorant voters on IMDb. Rarely does IMDb fail me, but I have been noticing of late a genuine shift into hyped up voting based on writer/director reputation and/or underground buzz. It was a great movie two thirds of the way through, but the last third leaves so much to be desired (because of plot change) that I began wondering if the emperors Coen were caught in their skivvies."
WriterDave,"Nov 12, 2007",6/10,"A Vietnam vet (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and casually takes off with two million dollars that a psychopathic bounty hunter (Javier Bardem) will do anything to get back. Meanwhile, a Sheriff nearing retirement (Tommy Lee Jones) strolls behind the mayhem always a few steps behind. Set in Texas in 1980, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a meticulously crafted misfire from the Coen Brothers and adapted for the screen from the Cormac McCarthy novel.Roger Deakin's stark cinematography matches perfectly the brilliant mise-en-scene and signature Coen Brothers' pacing. The audience is also treated to a revolving door of quirky side characters and dark deadpan humor in the dialog that have become the trademarks of a Coen Brothers' dramatic production. It would seem to be a return to form, but there's a wandering coldness to the film that leads to grave dissatisfaction.The most disappointing aspect is that there's a near perfect forty-five minute ""mini film"" riddled with white knuckle suspense involving the cat-and-mouse shoot-em-up between Bardem and Brolin that is lost inside yet another dour opus where Tommy Lee Jones plays a grizzled but good-hearted authority figure philosophizing about the sad state of the world for the umpteenth time. While Bardem and Brolin are sensational, Tommy Lee Jones seems to be playing an on-screen persona that has trumped his ability to show any type of range. He's typecast, and his character is made moot. Meanwhile Bardem gives a career-defining performance as the psychopath working with his own warped sense of morals. In what may prove to be ironic in the future, it's exactly the type of portrayal that risks making Bardem typecast in the same vein Anthony Hopkins was after his Hannibal Lecter character was born.The brooding tension built around Bardem's unforgettable villain and the inevitable showdown with Brolin's wayward cowboy is completely wasted in anti-climactic fashion with no resolution that leaves the film to meander in philosophies that ultimately signify nothing. Coming off three straight comedies (the last two of which, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", were abysmal) the Coen Brothers have clearly lost their footing in trying to get back to their roots. ""No Country for Old Men"" boasts many of their popular hallmarks and an instantly classic turn from Javier Bardem, but it lacks the moral fiber of ""Fargo"" and the dramatic climax of ""Blood Simple"". Coming home, it seems, isn't as easy as it looks when the roads are dusty and lead you nowhere."
sean320,"Sep 2, 2017",10/10,"I could watch No Country for Old Men over and over and over again. It is that good. It is thrilling to watch every time, and so rich with meaning and precision that you learn something new each time. Javier Bardem is outstanding, and the story is so well crafted that you need to watch it a second time to really get it.The interesting thing about No Country is that there is almost no musical scoring. It makes you so razor focused that it's impossible to look away. The first time I watched this movie, I started it on Netflix late at night, thinking I would start it and then go to bed and finish it another time. I was wrong. My eyes were glued to the TV, so immersed in the film that I watched the whole thing in that one sitting.The Coen brothers are so awesome."
lance13,"Feb 29, 2008",10/10,"I have no idea why the preceding few reviews have been so derogatory towards this film which truly is incredible from every perspective. No Country For Old Men (N.C.F.O.M.) deservedly won it's 4 academy awards for Best Picture, Director(s), Adapted Screenplay and Supporting Actor. NCFOM is a gritty, dark, southern Gothic thriller adapted by the brilliant Coens from McCarthy's visceral novel. The Performances are superb throughout, Brolin, Jones, and Harrelson are great and Javier Bardem simply becomes the psychopathic Anton Chigurh who represents a relentless evil and in a way an amoral judge. People say that it's easy to play a psycho, well when one embodies a deranged mind so completely subtle nuances, idiosyncrasies and all then a praiseworthy performance results (remeber Hopkins' Lecter and Kathy Bates' Annie Wilkes). In essence what i'm saying is, you will never forget Bardem's role after watching this film. The Coens yet again manage to fill this grizzly story with their unique humour especially when Jones and Harrelson are on screen, delivering some great one-liners. What must be commended most of all is the brothers' directing, coupled with a stunning, sun-scorched cinematography of the Texas wasteland, every shot in the film is a work of art. Every frame seems to be utterly planned out with amazing composition and style, hats off! I only wrote this review because i went to see this film 3 times in the cinema in one week, which is a first for me, and i could not stand to have people giving ridiculous scores of 1/10 to this masterpiece, simply because they did not absorb anything it has to offer (and it has plenty!) So 10/10 to the best picture of the year!"
jessediaz9271,"Nov 18, 2007",10/10,"I saw this movie already at a select theater in San Antonio, home of Tommy Lee Jones.As soon as the film opens I was transported to the Fargo landscape but in hot steamy Texas town, once the Fargoesque feeling disappeared the film was completely unique.The characters are unique and familiar at the same time. I lived in west Texas and Traveled New Mexico extensively so I was able to spot NM location quickly, even then the camera work and acting had me convinced I was in Texas throughout.I found myself confused when the film blurred the lines of the characters, as Tommy Lee Jones and his character play a tired, regretful sheriff who realizes his sins are catching up to him, and the villain played by Javier Bardem who is ever so cold and calculated but has impeccable ethics and is anything but dishonest. You are sure to enjoy this wild ride and find yourself engrossed by the well developed characters and realistic action and typical Coen suspense and story telling.Watch this film not once but two or three times. I plan to watch it again soon and I am sure I will enjoy it even more."

-----
""Well, I got here the same way the coin did.""No Country for Old Men is a 2007 film directed by the Coen Brothers, adapted from a book by the same name that was released two years prior. It's considered by many to be the best Coens' film, and it's the second film of theirs that I watch (the previous was Fargo, which I liked quite a bit).The movie follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Texas man who finds one day a large sum of money, with enough evidence around to know that it's blood money alright. He takes it anyway, and this action sets in motion a game of cat-and-mouse, as Moss flees from the Mexican cartel and one Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a cold-blooded man you definitely don't want to encounter in real life. There's also the town sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who tries to reach Moss first and get him to a safe place.One thing that makes this film pretty immersive for me for most of its runtime is the lack of music in the background for almost the entire runtime of this movie. Most of the sounds we hear are diegetic - the wind blowing, a light switch switched off, soft footsteps getting closer. Even when there is some music it's very, very subtle. This film pulls it off pretty well, especially in the tenser, slow-burning scenes.The second thing I want to focus on is something you've probably heard of even if you're yet to watch this film but you have some background on it - Chigurh, the villain, is probably the most memorable aspect of No Country for Old Men. For me, also the best part of the film. Javier Bardem delivered a precise performance here, which granted him the Oscar for best supporting actor, but it's more than that. Chigurh is so effective because of how clever, how ruthless, how methodical and cold-blooded he is. He's also somewhat alien, following his set of rules that we can't completely understand, and it makes him more creepy and unexpected and, well, entertaining. The cat-and-mouse game is so effective mostly because both characters involved do a lot of creative and clever things that are shown to us so we can put the puzzle pieces together ourselves. It's making the watching experience more active. Comparing it to Death Note may be a bit of a stretch but I feel like it's worth bringing up.The film is filled to the brim with violence that is almost casual, character deaths that happen in a blink of an eye, bloodshed that isn't shown in any dramatic or grand way. It's just there. The main idea of the film, the way I see it at least, is how chaotic and random and scary the world is, and always has been. Just like Chigurh (which is key to understand the underlying message in my opinion), the world has its own set of rules that we can't quite understand, and we try to bargain with the world but in the end it gets us all. Always was like this, complicated and dangerous and full of odd rules.I'll also briefly address the cinematography, which I find really solid and well-crafted, and the dialogue, which has a lot of cynical wit and iconic moments which I'm sure will stick with me for a while.The ending of this film, while I can understand the artistic value behind it, still makes the story feel somewhat incomplete to me. Maybe it will be a motif with the Coen Brothers' films and me, I don't know, but I'd even say that it bothers me here more than it does in Fargo, since here the choice to end this story in such an odd way is much more unexpected and extreme than the lack of catharsis in Fargo. It just bothers me, even if I get the reasoning behind it.I'd say that when it comes to emotional investment I wasn't really there, and I know that it's not this kind of movie but I still feel like I should've cared a little more for Moss as a character than I actually did, which isn't to say that I don't like the character at all but something doesn't fully click with me, for some reason.Overall, No Country for Old Men is an interesting take on the premise of being one against the world, and it provides a very well-made display of a clever cat-and-mouse game with a lot of bloodshed and gunpowder. The villain is especially great. The ending feels a little off to me, and though I know why it still doesn't fully click with me. Still, a good movie. I'm feeling a 7.8/10 on this one."
jackharding89-1,"Feb 19, 2008",10/10,"It must be hard being a Coen brother: knowing that no mater what you do it'll no doubt be compared to something from your ingenious, genre spanning filmography; Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O' Brother Where art Thou- the list goes on. That's no excuse for knocking-out out back-to-back let-downs that don't compare to Jaws 4, though. Alright, alright, that's a little harsh. Joel and Ethan's last 2 collaborations (Intollerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers) weren't that bad but they were found wanting in every trait and department we'd come to expect from the brothers grim: atmospheric set-ups, sublime photography, onion-like plots, cult characters, quirky humour, dark and light topics- inspired commitments to celluloid with a real sense of time and place. So what about No Country for Old Men? The Coens' perilously grave adaptation of Cormac Macarthy's acclaimed 2005 novel. Well, it doesn't so much signal a return to form as it does shove a cattle gun in your face while screaming ""GUESS WHO'S BACK AND GUNNING FOR Oscars!?""Opening with an eerie and muted montage redolent of their first film Blood Simple, The Coens' loyal spin on Macarthy's western thriller is a slow-boiling affair that unfolds in and around the Tex-Mex border. It's 1980 and after stumbling across a drug-deal gone wrong, cunning 'nam vet Lleyweln Moss (Josh Brolin) makes off with a case full-of cash and changes his life forever. But not in a good way. Apparently the money belonged to an imposing and methodical, almost ghost like killer called Anton Chigurgh (Javier Bardem) who's either Death incarnate or Satan himself. Who or whatever he is, the Devil's advocate wants his money back and absolutely will not stop until he gets to Moss. Enter Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee-Jones), a nostalgic old-timer who's haunted by the mind of the modern-day criminal but will do whatever he can to stop ""the dismal tide"" and get to Moss before Chigurgh.As the bodies pile up and the plot thickens, it becomes clear that No Country for Old Men is much more than a bloody game of cat and mouse with shot guns. It is a taut and chilling meditation on contemporary crime and criminality that bitterly chews on the themes of money, morality, youth, age, fate, faith, evil and society. And it's absolutely majestic. A meticulous and suspenseful fusion of cinematic art and high- quality entertainment with layers and substance in spades. The Coens even have the nerve to pepper their morbid principle-play with bouts of jet black humour. Hell, they even toss-in an abrupt ending. The brilliant bastards.No Country for Old Men is their most profound and important film to date. Better than Fargo. Better than Miller's Crossing. It could well be their masterpiece. A bold claim, yes, but everything just seems to come together; the look, the score, the feel, the acting: Brolin, Bardem and Tommy Lee-Jones are all excellent. Former two giving stellar, break- through turns that'll kick-down doors for their careers. Brolin is bang- on as the dry and driven Moss and Bardem's forbidding portrayal of the mop-top hunter Chigurgh is nothing short of memorable. Woody Harleson's even in there with a guardian angel-like side character but it's Lee- Jones turn as the overwhelmed Sheriff that proves to be the most important and pertinent of the pack. His opening monologue and insights into what's unfolding speak not just for the Coens' 1980's based thriller but for today's world. ""A crime's so harsh these days it's hard to even take its measure"" Not only does Bell represent a cleaner, pre- drug generation but also the conscience of the film. He's more of a hamstrung bystander than the cop charged with bringing an end to the evil and bloodletting. His sombre and reflective words of thought and fear book end the film in some style and leave plenty of room for interpretation. ""When I got older I always thought that God would sorta come into my life. He didn't"".Through their encyclopedic knowledge and love of film along with the exemplary photography of Roger Deakins, Joel and Ethan are able to extract the prose right from the pages of Macarthy's lucid parable and paint the screen with them. The Coens' do a little more than justice to the book. No Country for Old Men is a monumental piece of American film that could clean-up at this year's Oscars. And that's saying something when you consider the competition in The Assassination of Jesse James.. and There Will be Blood. My god, what a golden period for US cinema. This awesome Coen comeback is deserving of the best director(s) gong at the least. Joel and Ethan have set the bar for 2008 with an instant- classic. Miss this at your peril."
jon-c-ison,"Jul 14, 2020",7/10,"A simple chase story with a modern Western vibe, brought alive by compelling characters brilliantly acted throughout. The core of the film to me was the simple portrayal of the humanity (good and ill) of the many characters, in sharp contrast to the interesting but chilling psychopath antagonist. Attention is paid to all the characters, even minor roles, and the subtle but very true portrayal of different facets of human nature - which is what really carries the movie. The action sequences are superbly done - chilling and blood soaked - and well timed, and the tension and pace is just right throughout. The ending, perhaps, is a bit sudden. Recommended."

This is one of the Coen Brothers best films,one of my all-time favorite films and one of the greatest films ever made.Based on Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in West Texas in 1980,No Country For Old Men tells the story of a hunter named Lleweyln Moss(Josh Brolin)who comes across a drug deal gone bad and finds two million dollars in a briefcase. Even though he has the money,Lleweyln knows he's not safe and has to find a way out while being tracked by a dangerous hit-man named Anton Chigurh(Jarvier Bardem),local county sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)and Mexican drug dealers all leading up to a violent and bloody chase and cat and mouse game.NCFOM is a masterpiece that works not just as Crime Thriller,but,also works as a Coen Brothers film,character study,the study on the themes of life,death and fate and as a Contemporary Western. What I love about NCFOM is that while it is a Coen Brothers film,at times it doesn't feel like one because of the way the Coens approach the story. Unlike most of the Coens films,where violence and chaos are done with loud sounds and a music score,this film has a very quiet and somber demeanor,giving us a world of the Texas landscape where violence and chaos is almost silent and unheard and where no character is safe. The Action and Violence in the film are well-done with suspense and intensity and the fact that there is no music during the Action scenes adds to the film's greatness and puts you on the edge of your seat. The Action and violence in the film is bloody and dark and will disturb you to the core. The screenplay by The Coens is excellent,adapting McCarthy's dialog word for word right out of the book,with The Coens still bringing some of their signature style and sense of humor and wit to the script. The movie is a great character study as well,with the three main character Ed Tom,Anton and Llewelyn in the forefront. The three main characters are well-developed and memorable,each of them having great scenes on their own and as the film goes on you understand their motivations,who they are and who they're about,whether it's Llewelyn and the money,Anton Chigurh and his pursuit of the money and Ed Tom reactions to the things he sees all around him. What sets NCFOM from other crime Thrillers is the film's study of Life,death and fate. Life,death and fate seem to either effect or goes with the characters,with Anton Chigurh who is basically a physical representation of death and fate. Chigurh strongly believes in fate and uses a coin to find out whether you die or not,if you guess heads or tails,one or the other right,you live,if you don't you will die at the hands of Chigurh. The gas station scene in the film will show you. Where Llewelyn is trying to defend himself from violence and death,Sheriff Ed Tom just doesn't understand why there's violence all around and why the times are changing all around him,with drugs,guns and death in the air. Ed Tom represents the past where old time sheriff's didn't have to use a gun or deal with violence,the future in this film is drugs,guns,death and the real danger and Horror of violence,something that Ed Tom Bell doesn't understand and can't figure out why it's happening and there is a sadness and dread that hangs over the film with Ed Tom and the title No Country For Old Men refers to him. NCFOM is also a modern Western in many respects and while we don't see any stagecoaches and six-shooters,you will see characters riding horses and wearing cowboy hats and Roger Deakins beautiful photography shows viewers the dust and dirt of West Texas making look beautiful and nice during the day while making the film dark and eerie at night. The ending of the film will divide viewers and will fall into two categories people who love the ending or who will hate the ending,I fall into the former category because the Coens while staying true to their vision,also stay true to the vision of McCarthy's novel offering viewers a powerful and unforgettable conclusion that doesn't end with a bang,but with a whimper and one of the reasons NCFOM is a Masterpiece.The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Josh Brolin is does a great job as Llewelyn Moss bringing a grit and toughness to the role. Jarvier Bardem is brilliant as Anton Chigurh,one of the best villains in movie history. Bardem is frightening,scary and menacing and doesn't try to be scary,he just is. Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell,bringing a quiet,somber and sometimes dry humor to the performance. Woody Harrelson does good job as Carson Wells,an associate of Anton Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald does a fine job as Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean Moss and considering Macdonald's Scottish in real life does a good job with the Texas accent. Garret Dillahunt(Wendell),Tess Harper(Loretta Bell),Barry Corbin(Ellis),Stephen Root(Man who hires Wells)and Beth Grant(Carla Jean's Mother)give fine performances as well.The Coen Brothers(Joel and Ethan)direction in the film is excellent and the Coens give the film great pace and timing,while giving film a great since of atmosphere and tone,always moving the camera. Brilliant direction Joel and Ethan.The score by Carter Burwell is rarely heard in the film,but when in use is effective and fits with the mood of the film. Fine score.In final word,if you love Crime Thrillers,Drama,character study's,Western,The Coen Brothers,Cormac McCarthy or cinema,I suggest you see No Country For Old Men,an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and is one of The Coen Brothers Best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.j"

BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Feb 27, 2008",9/10,"Movies that stimulate plenty of discussion about whether they are good or bad or awful are probably movies that should be seen more than once. I had that feeling after seeing films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' Not much really happens in those movies and they have a lengthy runtime. Kubrick's film has 88 minutes of no dialog. That's like making a feature length film and not having any spoken dialog, and by today's standards (even 1968 standards) that is odd. The Coen Brothers' latest film has that quality to it. Not a whole lot happens for large parts of the film.The fact of the matter is that not a whole SEEMS to happen. Take one of the opening scenes as Llewelyn sees the man sitting underneath the tree. He looks at him, nothing. He looks again, nothing. He moves in closer, rifle trained, nothing. He sees the man has bled. The bag next to the dead body has money, a lot of money. So he takes it. Aesthtically, not much happens as Llewelyn just warily approaches the tree. Mentally, however, is where the action is. Llewelyn is part afraid, part curious, but being cautious enough to keep his wits and try not to get killed. Obviously from the previous scene we see that the money in question is a hot item and a good deal of people died for it.In today's special effects drenched age people seem to have completely forgotten what real tension and suspense is. It is not a huge wall of fire (a la 'Independence Day') coming at you, but what is going through your head when you see that wall of fire coming. With this film, the Coens have put the tension in an intentionally bare landscape in order to show as little aesthetic flair as possible. This amplifies the psychological impact and suspense as there seems to be nowhere for Llewelyn to hide from a killer who also seems to appear from nowhere. Call it a MacGuffin technique or whatever floats your boat.The film is also highly more symbolic than the typical movie of today. Many things are implied, not actually shown. Much of the dialog and situations are allegorical (or applicable) to things much more general than a search for dirty money. Thus, this isn't a film solely for entertainment, which is what people want today (many people, not all). This is a film that first and foremost attempts to stimulate thought like '2001' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' The abundant discussion here about whether it was good or bad or boring or pointless pretty much seems to confirm just that. People are talking about it. Whether it is out of frustration of praise is almost incidental, since it only confirms that the Coens achieved their goal. Maybe soon we'll see a director(s) make an actual film in response to this one. That is what living art is all about - it acts and reacts, just like its characters. --- 9/10Rated R for violence. Ages 13+"
lastliberal,"Jan 28, 2008",10/10,"West Texas is a perfect setting for a movie like this -- no trees, just desolate land for miles around. The chicken farmer (Richard Jackson) was from Alpine -a place in the middle of nowhere with a long long stretch of road that literally - I kid you not - has turkey buzzards on the fence posts along the way. Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, ""That Old Ace in the Hole."" I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen. He knows that he is no match for Chigurg. It's not Richard Kimble or Mark Sheridan he's chasing, but a man who has no match.The dialog is dry and things are not always explained. There is constant tension knowing what may lie on the other side of the door.Jones' buddy Ellis had it down: Whatcha got ain't nothing new. ""This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity."" Dying with your boots on is still dying."
michaeltrivedi,"Dec 29, 2019",9/10,"Coed Brothers. A dark thriller about a bag of money. An exchange by the drug dealers, all deceased in a gun battle. The man who steals the money. And the guy who's trained to do anything to find him. And the cop on pursuit.It's that kinda movie.This movie has such a subtle hard punch in the face that you don't see it coming. The pursuer is a really dark character. He has no personality, and yet he's kinda cool. Josh Brolin is pretty hard hitting too. The underdog type of guy. Not the most attractive, kinda short, stocky, oddly shaped. But he's the main character. The cowboy, the man! And then everything else.This movie comes together perfectly. It's one hell of a ride.9 stars"
ScottMan-3,"Dec 30, 2007",6/10,"this is the first review i read after returning from a movie that left everyone in the audience completely mystified and scratching their heads in amazement..: ""DO NOT LISTEN TO THE IGNORANT PEOPLE GIVING THIS BAD REVIEWS!!!! They are the people that go to a movie just wanting to see Vin Diesel blow things up, or see Ice Cube babysit. Heaven forbid a movie without a happy ending, one that makes you think about characters and theme....etc,etc"" ......in short, the individual who wrote the review i just quoted is clearly reviewing it from a bizarrely different perspective that does NOT address storytelling basics; i mean, HOW,...HOW on this planet does someone come out of that movie talking like this:........""Such a complex film requires deep thinking. While the plot itself isn't too complicated, the characters are multi-dimensional, and the themes are subtle, in a way that some people may not understand."" I don't think there is anyone reading this review (of mine) that is going to want to continue reading an unending rant and rave (and i don't wanna write it) so,i am going to get straight to the point. The movie DID have some terrific moments,but when you string a series of moments together for 2 hours and the storyline does not offer up some basic sets of logic (like a more impressive law enforcement effort after a cop is killed) you come to expect in our age of senseless violence, there is still an audience, sitting there (no matter how smart or stupid they are),waiting for some small semblance of ""cohesion"" in a story...to give a hint that the people IN the story are not soooooooooo far disconnected with all of the things in the world that the audience sees in their everyday life. the bottom line is that this movie has so much stubborn incoherence and ""detraction"" from any sense of conclusion or closure on many parts of it that there is an inevitable deep sense of storytelling betrayal that has absolutely nothing to do with the argument that it should be recognized for ""a complex film requiring deep thinking""...i mean..........seriously; the movie is just........not.......very ...........good. period. no complex thinking is needed to be able to point out that simple,clear fact. So,when you get past all of your graduate level film courses and analytical techniques, you still have to figure out if a film can rise to the level of storytelling that is capable of doing more than lead a complete roomfull of people to an ""oh, my God,what the hell was that"" final reaction.thx...Scott"
Gordon-11,"Jan 26, 2008",N/A,"This film is about a man who accidentally finds 2 million dollars in a desert. He is then hunted by various people who want the money.""No Country For Old Men"" is different from what I thought it would be. It is not as mischievously fun as ""The Ladykillers"", or as plot driven as ""Miller's Crossing"". Instead, ""No Country For Old Men"" uses a lot of cold blooded shocks. Javier Bardem is amazing as a cold blooded person. His face never even twitch a bit when he kills random people. However, the plot is a little hard to follow. There are many loose ends that are not explained. I am also a bit annoyed by the surrealistic ease of everyone finding everyone."
dajemitchell,"Apr 7, 2008",10/10,"A great film by the Coen Brothers and by far the best of 2007.

estebangonzalez10,"Sep 16, 2010",9/10,"The best Coen movie since Fargo! Javier Bardem gives a terrifying performance as Anton Chigurh. From the opening scene we are introduced to this morbid character who has the coolest weapon I have seen for a villain in any movie. There is a lot of silence in the film which adds to the tension and thrills. The dialogue is excellent and philosophical at times. Tommy Lee Jones narration is great as he realizes no matter how hard he tries he cant change the evil in the world after he had maintained order as a sheriff in his small and quiet town in west Texas. The movie begins and ends with Jones narration. In the opening narrative he tells the story of a boy he sent to the electric chair who had killed his 14 year old girlfriend for no apparent reason. This narration sets the tone for the entire movie as we are introduced to Anton, a evil man who kills without hessitation. The abrupt ending has a lot to do with what Jones has been saying since the beginning of the movie. His final narration deals with the issue of the impossibility of understanding these evil characters and feels all he has done has been in vain. Great film which lives up to its predecessor, Fargo. Well deserved win for best picture of the year!"
hardrock666,"Aug 3, 2008",10/10,"'No Country for Old Men' is a grim and unsettling film that curiously makes its viewer beg for more of the same. In adapting Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, sibling writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, the team behind 'Fargo' and 'O Brother Where Art Thou?,' keep their quirky humor in check and stare unflinchingly at the worst humanity has to offer. As a result, the duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date.The Coens have always penned lively dialogue (""We felt the institution no longer had anything to offer us,"" says John Goodman, justifying his prison break in ""Raising Arizona"") and demonstrated visual panache (the wood chipper scene in ""Fargo"" is hard to forget).But the characters in ""No Country for Old Men,"" despite being larger than life, seem more real and believable. It's much easier to get worked up over their outcomes than wondering how the broad characters in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" might fare.It also doesn't hurt that the new film is loaded with several first-rate performers who can make potentially outlandish situations seem real. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Ed Tom Bell, a grizzled, third-generation lawman who has stumbled upon a grizzly case that makes anything he's handled before seem tame.An antelope hunter named Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the aftermath of a drug deal that turned into a massacre. The only survivor of the class is a mortally-wounded man who's only able to beg for water, which Llewellyn doesn't have.In what seems like a major stroke of luck, he discovers a case of money that no one at the site of the debacle has lived to collect. He takes it home to his trailer park, bewildering his wife (Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald).The seemingly untraceable fortune actually has several people eager to claim it. A flashy hired gun named Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) has the dual task of retrieving the money and finding another fellow who's after it.Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, obliterating his Spanish accent) may have been hired initially to find the cash, but he quickly leaves a trail of blood as long as the Nile. With his drooping bangs, Chigurh looks almost comical from a distance. His cold, brown eyes, however, betray how dangerous he can be. He murders anyone who gets in his way. And he often seems to dispatch people simply for pleasure.He's also as inventive as he is arbitrarily cruel. He can turn air tanks into a both a weapon and a door opener. Think of his as a Satanic McGuyver. Barden also projects the right blend of menace and buffoonery that makes each of Chigurh's attacks seem appropriately shocking.As Chigurh's quarry, Brolin is appropriately compelling. He may have been dumb to get himself in his current predicament, but he's resourceful enough to survive longer than anyone else who crosses Chigurh's path. Brolin has a likable sad sack quality to makes you wish he could get out of his grim situation.Following all of the sordid events is Jones' Earl Tom. The sheriff can read a crime scene with astonish accuracy, but correctly worries that it will take a Herculean effort to prevent a greater bloodbath. Jones demonstrates a fascinating vulnerability that belies his tough guy image and manages to make a character who functions primarily as a narrator engaging on his own terms.In addition to three terrific lead performances, the Coens manage to deliver some of their usual wordplay. When asked how dangerous Chigurh is, Wells simply replies, ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?"" And thanks to McCarthy's plot line, they also have some genuinely surprising plot twists. The film constantly throws off a viewer's expectations.""No Country for Old Men"" is sometimes a difficult film to watch because it's unflinchingly grim and often leaves viewers to reach their own decisions about what happened.But the film lingers in the brain long after the credits start rolling and proves the Coen's can examine the frailty of the human heart as skillfully as they can manipulate words and images."
Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Apr 23, 2011",9/10,"At first, I saw this film as a straight story of violence and greed. However, it is so much more than just what's on the surface. The Coens take this interesting story of violence and turn it into one of the most shocking and intelligent studies of themes ranging from predestination versus the unpredictability of chance to American greed and consequences for violence.Llewelyn Moss is our main protagonist for the majority of the film, but it's Ed Tom Bell who serves as our opener and closer and his approach to the whole state of the world in this is a fantastic way of not letting the audience disappear into this world of violence. Instead of just accepting that this is the world of the film, we always have Ed Tom to come in and explain to us that this violent existence is our existence as well and it's disgusting. I've always loved the approach of a character who looks back on life with regret and this is one of the best examples of that. Tommy Lee Jones was the perfect choice for this role, and he really hits that stoic manliness while also just being filled with guilt and borderline disgust over the state of the world. Except it's gotten to a point where it's not even disgust anymore, it's just depressed indifference. It's brilliant.Our look at these characters ends with Ed Tom detailing one of his dreams to his wife. In the dream, him and his father were back in older times, traveling in this mountain pass. His father rides ahead with a fire and a blanket, not saying anything as he passes. The road is cold and dark and hard to get through, but Ed Tom knows that once he gets through it all and makes it to his father, he'll be warm and taken care of. Everything will be alright. Then comes the film's now-famous final line, ""And then I woke up..."", with him coming back into our world. It's kind of a chilling ending, again commenting on the rough and ruthless state of our current existence. Back in older times, no matter how hard things got, you would know that everything was going to be alright in the end. There would be a fire and light to keep you safe and warm. But now, that doesn't exist anymore. He woke up and now he's not so sure that everything is going to be alright when he gets through that rough terrain. There might just be more.I feel like the film is two almost separate entities. There's the chase down with Anton and Llewelyn and the drug money, then there's Ed Tom almost acting as his own audience, coming in and just being marveled by the immense violence that these men run through during the film. In so many ways, this is a film that doesn't follow any conventional means, and in keeping with this it's one of the few films where we not only see the consequences of violence, we see the aftermath. It's not like a serial killer movie where the detective gratuitously goes through the blood and carnage to find a clue. Ed Tom rides in and just...experiences the cost of the violence that these men don't think twice about when they present it into the world.One of the most interesting aspects of the film comes in the form of Anton Chigurh. Classified by most as a ""villain"", the character for the large part of the film represents so much more than that; anarchy, the cruel and unpredictable act of fate and, most importantly, consequence. A lot of people see Chigurh as just this unstoppable evil, but it should be noted that the character only acts out of a response to the violence of the world. He is only a part of this world because the world requires him to be. Someone like Chigurh coming into existence is nothing beyond the consequence for a world that has become so lost in it's belief that violence is the ultimate answer.Although in certain scenes, particularly the now infamous gas station exchange, he simply represents the uncertainty of fate. All of your life you make decisions that lead you down certain paths, and making one wrong decision could lead you to an immediate and unexpected demise. Chigurh at times can be the ultimate example of this, with the simple choice of heads or tails standing between you and a grave. The scene near the end with him and Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean is a great representation of this whole thing. She tells him that he can choose to leave, that it's up him and he responds simply by saying that it's out of his control. Fate isn't in anyone's control and whether you like it or not, sometimes there are choices you make that lead you down completely different paths and this story just happens to have that choice potentially leading to the ultimate path.This is perhaps my favorite aspect of No Country for Old Men, the fact that the film isn't conventional in any way whatsoever. We have a ""villain"" with absolutely no backstory, there's no sign of hope or bright light at the end of the tunnel, the film doesn't end with a bang but with a whisper, major characters get killed off-screen, nothing is safe here and nothing is predictable. I think that the best films are the ones where you have no idea what's going to happen, but you know that whatever it is, it's going to be unique and incredible. You don't know what path you'll get taken down, but you trust the director(s) to take you down it."
kevin_robbins,"Jun 21, 2023",10/10,"No Country for Old Men (2007) is a movie that is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The first time I saw this was actually at an advanced screening with Josh Brolin in Georgetown. The storyline follows a simple man out hunting one day in Texas when he comes across some murdered men at the boarder and a truck full of cash. He takes the cash but is quickly tracked by a ruthless man with a unique form of killing whom wants his money. Meanwhile a sheriff ready to retire is on the tracks of the killer, but can he find him before he catches the man with the money?This movie is directed by the Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars Tommy Lee Jones (Men in Black), Josh Brolin (W), Woody Harrelson (CHEERS), Javier Bardem (Skyfall), Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire), Beth Grant (Donnie Darko) and Stephen Root (Office Space).Everything about this movie is brilliant. The storyline, characters, kills, dialogue and circumstances are so unique and intriguing. The cast delivers an awesome performance, especially Bardem, Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. I always find myself rooting for all three characters. Every scene feels authentic and believable despite every sequence being unpredictable. The settings and pace of the movie is perfect and I adore the metaphors throughout the movie. The narration is also very good and sets the mood for the film. The ending is sad and rewarding at the same time.Overall, everything about this movie is brilliant. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
schell-7,"Apr 30, 2012",10/10,"The title comes from the opening line of W. B. Yeats' famous poem ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland (""no country for old men"") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium. But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence. This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions. On the other hand, it's not a story for those those film-goers who insist on a traditional ""movie bad guy"" and simply cannot, or refuse to, see the universal and very personal meanings represented by the characters, all of whom--from Barden's unstoppable killer to Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff--mirror our deepest desires, fears, and insecurities. Although not a movie serving up the escape and closure expected by traditional theater audiences, it nevertheless has the power to grip and engage the viewer like few other films. And like a Flannery O'Connor short story, its dark humor and violence ultimately lodge in personal consciousness (I frankly was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end, before leaving the theater ""sadder but wiser"" for the experience).The story is the Coen brothers' ""bait"" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters. After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with ""self-consciousness""-- with the capacity to think about our individual ""identities,"" and even about our own life and death. The key to putting together all that the spectator has experienced comes with the appearance of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff in the final scene of the movie. He says that he's quitting as sheriff. He had expected ""God to somehow come into his life"" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched. The film's nemesis is a merciless ""executioner"" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of ""morality"") inadequate. We, like the sheriff, are now faced with the inescapability of our own mortality and with re-visioning our past life in light of this disturbing reality.Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic ""hero."" he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in ""Nam""--but that won't cut it in the relentless, fatalistic, chancy determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives. Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother and he can be distracted by a female sunbather.Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly. She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice. Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, representing mortality more accurately: ""It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me. It's you."" But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: ""You're wrong. That's how I got here."" It's a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. But its through Bardem's mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God. When will we learn? Why can't we?And therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's ""fatal flaw"" and along with it a small ray of light. Human agency has a role after all. Brolin did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else. And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat. Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother- in-law, selfishly assuming that the Executioner was interested ""only"" in him.The last two scenes practically ""require"" interpretation. The Executioner (vulnerable himself, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away. Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act. The recovered Executioner now ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet""). What's next on his agenda? The viewer can only speculate, even as the film cuts to Jones' sheriff relating a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: ""I woke up.""That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on. It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever. There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them. It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us. We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that ""good"" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it. And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery. And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will when we're older.Finally, the film's setting must be taken seriously. It repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered. Everyone wants answers. We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them."
tanelteder,"Jan 18, 2011",8/10,"No Country For Old Men is one the best I have seen from Coen brothers. I liked their O Brother Where Art Thou but I disliked Fargo. Well, I gotta tell you, it's like a day and night with Fargo. The movie is an extremely creepy. A very haunting tale. There's something very gripping about this one. I think girls won't find it interesting that much. It's more like a guys territory. Boys enjoy it. Plenty of cool chase scenes and some awesome action ones which has a touch of Coen' power in it.The trio is fantastic. Javier Bardem, in his own words, is out of his comfort zone, but he delivers. A scary performance by him. Well, Tommy Lee Jones for that, is totally in his comfort zone. Josh Brolin with his mustache is good too.This movie is about men's country. Men rule and shape this country. How? See and maybe you get the answer."
Cyborgandjimbo-58-736016,"Dec 10, 2011",10/10,"Cormac McCarthy's national bestseller help the coen brothers make their first and finest adaption. No Country For Old Men, the bloodiest hell ride that shows the horror of the notorious psychopath kilter, named Anton Chigurh.This madman soon chases this guy named Llewellyn Moss, a Vietnam veteran who finds a truckload of Mexican brown dope and a case filled with ten million dollars in cash, with dead bodies laying around him. So Llewellyn tries to keep the ten million so his wife can have all that she needs, then thats when chigurh comes in. The man in back of the situation is Ed Tom Bell, an old sheriff thats new to these kind of crimes (hence the title of movie), with 1980s Mexican border problems, much more murders happen.These three men are never really filmed together throughout the movie, even though its a chase movie, but it shows how the creative mind of the coens put a unique their in there movie, which makes it not very visible to you. I've also heard that it stayed true to the book, and has set a great visual to it as well. The originality of this film definitely makes it a much watch, and its the bloodiest from the coens I've seen yet.Javier Bardem shows his skills in new type of work, being Chigurh. His creepy looks (mostly the haircut) shows that the character is insane, has no sense of humor, and no sense of compassion or regret. His weapons are as unique as him, being some strange air tank that shoots through locks, and this shotgun with a gigantic silencer, which probably makes most of the gore in the movie. Nobody can play a better role as Llewelyn than Josh Brolin. growing up as a country man made this role easy for him, just acting like himself will be perfect acting. Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, which Jones also said that the character he was playing was a lot like him as well as Brolin, like some of the parts was just like a natural conversation to him.No Country For Old Men has inspired me in so many levels. A movie this original, could be one of the best. This movie is one of the best of the decade, very close to ""There Will Be Blood"", and thats one good compliment."
MrPupkin,"Oct 24, 2019",9/10,"This movie holds up incredibly well. Even many years later, the film stands strong and murders the audience expectations. The strong point of uncomfortable silence really adds so much to the movie. Fantastic."
Prismark10,"Nov 16, 2013",7/10,"No Country for Old Men is a grandiose, dark, violent Neo-Western thriller from the Coen Brothers.Adapted from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Brolin plays an ordinary Joe who whilst out hunting finds a fortune in the aftermath of a drug deal that went bad.This leads to a cat and mouse game involving three men. Brolin who has to evade the relentless hit-man with a bad haircut played by Bardem.He also has to steer clear of Lee Jones, the violence weary veteran sheriff on the hunt for both men knowing that Brolin has bitten off more than he can chew and is in danger.The film is set in Texas of 1980 with a bleak, desert landscape. It is important to note the year, it means Brolin's character is a Vietnam war veteran and the film deals with the purported rise of modern urban violence from the 1970s onwards.McCarty's novel and its adaptation deals with themes of fatalism, conscience and circumstance. The Coen Brothers have dealt with various types of crime genres before in their film careers ranging from Blood Simple, Crimewave, Fargo and Miller's Crossing.In those films there have also been some form of humour even the the dark kind. Here they can pull the themes together in a grander scale as they have the source material that richly delivers. There is much less humour. A journey to bleakness lies for a lot of the participants.It is a combination of a modern western and an urban thriller. Even its 1980s setting with its fashion and style can easily merge with the present day with the presence of four wheel drive vehicles, high rise buildings and automatic weapons.The violence displayed is an important part of the film but some viewers may find this with the grim tone too much for them."
gigan-92,"Jan 23, 2012",10/10,"A+The Coen Brothers have definitely caught my eye. I know they have an impressive career, but this film is my favorite of theirs. It has the cinematography and location of a great modern Western, the lighting of a film noir, and the great dialogue of a Coen Brother film. The difference though is that ""Fargo"" (another Coen brother favorite of mine) is a dark comedy-drama, and this film, as the Coen Brothers put it, is about the unstoppable evil"". Playing that evil is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigur, and he's one of the best movie villains I've ever seen. The theme of the movie, as in the book it is based on, is the decadence of our country. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are subject to this. Those expecting a traditional morality tale, the triumph of good over evil, will not find it here.I find that the majority of the viewers say that they love the build-up of the movie, the pacing being perfect, the action great, and the drama well-written. What they often say they can't stand is the ending. Without spoiling the climax, I can understand where they're coming from, but I have to disagree. Anybody who watched ""Fargo"" for the first time surely didn't expect the brand of comedy the film dwelled on. In the same light, viewers of ""No Country for Old Men' should expect the usual guidelines to go right out the window. As a true film lover, the ending, no matter how against your wishes it maybe, try to keep this in mind: the filmmakers are attempting something different, something bold. I learned this lesson the hard way some time ago when I first viewed ""Arlington Road"".Also, kudos to Kelly Macdonald, who did an extremely well done job, and I love Woody Harrelson no matter the film. And despite all the film's seriousness, it does have a touch of comedy with the MacDonald character's mother, played well by Beth Grant."
SoCalOvid,"Mar 17, 2008",N/A,"When you think of watching ""No Country for Old Men"", think: Sam Peckinpah with only half the plot, and no conclusion. A movie in which Tommy Lee Jones provides the comic relief, spouting pseudo-Texas-isms, presumably to take shots at Dan Rather  Courage! Javier Bardem, an excellent Spanish actor who plays real roles in Spanish movies, is once again cast as an over-the-top maniac (as in 'Dance with the Devil'.) For this movie to have won Academy Awards is either telling us that 2007 sucked for good movies (although in 2007 Hollywood had record profits,) or that Academy members have a secret cabal to make the Awards seem as worthless as Nobel Peace Prizes!"
jackgdemoss,"Sep 11, 2019",9/10,"This film had been on my watch list for a year before I finally got around to seeing it. I was most impressed by the Coen brothers' ability to use the typical story arc for protagonists, antagonists, and supporting cast, and flip them on their head. I jaw dropped from surprise multiple times in the first act. This classic is a great watch."
muditmonfils,"Aug 30, 2009",10/10,"Overview:No Country for Old Men is a movie based on a novel written by Cormac McCarthy with the same name. The story describes how a cop discovers a bag full of million dollars at a site where a drug deal went awry. The cop takes all the money and runs away with it. Chigurh, a professional hit-man, wants to retrieve the satchel of money (which contains a hidden radio transponder to which Chigurh has the corresponding receiver). With the help of the transponder Chigurh tracks the cop. What happens next is ought to be seen in the movie !Was it any good?No Country for Old Men will blow your mind off with the sizzling performances from all of its actors. Javier Barden is the show stealer in the movie. His portrayal of the character Anton Chigurh is very realistic and is worth every penny of your movie ticket! He won an Oscar for his work in this movie. Josh Brolin as the cop comes second in the department. I don't think any other actor has the guts to portray the character played by him. The role of a tough cop always suits him (see American Gangster). The movie has a 1980's touch to it. The barren lands of Texas sharing borders with Mexico adds a cow-boy-movies like backdrop to the film. I give it a 5/5 for the beautiful cinematography. One of the distinctive features of move is that there's hardly any background music in it. You just get to listen to a bit at the starting and a full length(er) at the end. This makes the viewing experience very different compared to other movies.Verdict:No Country for Old Men is a solid movie. Very realistic movie with some of the finest performances of the decade. It won 4 awards at the Oscars. If you have missed this film at the theaters, go grab a DVD."
nairtejas,"Sep 2, 2013",8/10,"This is my second Coen Brothers' movie & I am already a fan. Because, it talks about life as a whole and not in parts.Always depicting violence, the makers in here have gone one step further into psychological reasoning behind the violence. The cast performance, cinematography, direction, plot & screenplay are perfect factors. Some of them are second only to music, although a little more engaging score could've changed my 8.2 rating. Speaking too much but not going over is what the plot does. The trembling effect it has on its viewers is that the definitions re boundless and 80% of the happenings are free to imagination. As the message that comes out of it is varied, No Country For Old Men is a must watch, since we need to feel the gravity of the other side of humanity.Alas, it does have its dull moments, mostly carried by conversations or self-thoughts. Personally, these are the only discrepancies I found.One more reason to watch is Javier Bardem & his phenomenal portrayal. Bravo!BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

johnnyboyz,"Dec 2, 2009",10/10,"The Coen Brothers' late 2007, early 2008 film No Country for Old Men has very, very quickly embedded itself as one of my favourites of the contemporary age of film-making. I've seen it a number of times now, two times of which have been in recent months alone – here is a film I get odd chills in just contemplating watching it or not. If there was a film released in Britain in the calendar year of 2008, that was better than this and wasn't Steven McQueen's Hunger, then I either haven't seen it or it doesn't exist. The film is a burning, brilliantly observed piece, encompassing the horror of the world; morality and plain pure old fashioned film making techniques such as the ability to build suspense and execute action. Once just isn't enough with No Country for Old Men.The film is a crime-infused, MacGuffin driven tale between two predominant sides playing cat-and-mouse with one another in the wide open playground that is the state of Texas in a dusty June, circa 1980. The two warring sides are Josh Brolin's downbeat and somewhat cynical Llewelyn Moss, and he's in direct competition with Spanish actor Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh; a cold and seemingly emotionless killer who appears to have gone rouge from his employers and is now on Moss' tail. Thrown in amidst these two are the elements of innocent bystanders; hide and seek games at road side motels; shop, trailer and toll booth workers; an angry group of Mexican gangsters whom show up in fits and starts with their own prerogative and the law themselves, this time in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff, named Ed Tom Bell.The chaos is ignited when Moss, having accidentally shot a wild animal in the leg whilst trying to score a body shot, notices a trail of blood left by a pit-bull terrier. Moss observes the dog, who eerily looks back at him with a sort of knowing sense of what bloodshed and chaos comes with what he's just run away from: ""Trust me, it's not worth it"" seems to be the exclamation. At the site, made more shocking by the presence of bullet ridden mutts, Moss waltz's through a barren patch of land inhabited by dead drug dealers, automatic weaponry and shot-up trucks. A few hundred yards off is a few million dollars in cash, which he swipes after appearing to confront himself with the question. A distant storm begins to break, with feint cracks of thunder – the bag that contained the money is beginning to double up as Pandora's box.The film's immediate opening is a voice over uttered by a man that has seen better days. His comments, recollections and opinions on life and the world is juxtaposed by some fantastic Texas scenery. Bell talks of the old times, and how some sheriffs in the past barely drew their gun as there was so little crime – just 35 minutes in sees Bell's deputy, who's just a kid in comparison, drawing his gun to enter a potentially dangerous property. Bell's reaction to this is fascinating. The beauty of the locale shooting suggests that the man still loves his home area and the place in which he has spent his whole life, but looks on with concern; that times change and people have to change with them otherwise they'll be left behind. What follows this knowing observation, the film's central theme of making sense of it all, is a brutal murder - the first of many Chigurh will commit. The Coen's thrust you into the centre of Chigurh's world with this killing, setting up the white-knuckle ride and getting across this guy's cold efficiency; something that is put in contrast with Moss' earlier inability to take his time, take aim and shoot a nonthreatening wild animal.While widely accepted as one of the greatest screen villains from recent years, Chigurh is a collection of very basic but very effective things. Predominantly, his uncanniness is born out of his weapons of choice; those being a stun gun later established to exist so as to kill livestock painlessly as well as a standard pump action shotgun that comes complete with a silencer, thus creating an odd metallic whooshing noise when fired. His sly and sporadic use of ambiguous quotes and metaphors combine with his ruthless ability to play games and con those around him, out of methods of transportation or whatever. The scene in mind that sticks out most is the initial ""call it"" exchange at a petrol station, during which odd shaped pieces of material are lined up behind the supposed victim; all of which are in the shape of a crude noose suggesting impending death, doom or execution.The film is violent, but the attention to the repercussions of violence are what makes it seem more gruesome than it is. When characters get injured later on, they need to treat themselves and this focus is ten times more nasty and more effective than, for instance, lining up nothing characters in a Saw sequel and lopping their limbs off. The film is so very visceral in its attention to sound; the build ups to two motel exchanges between certain characters is arguably more exciting than the following action sequences with light switches, floor boards, cocked guns and distant telephone tones all playing their part. With a sense of humour running throughout that is as dry as those rough, dusty early desert scenes and a fantastically structured narrative revolving around this man Moss; the decisions he makes and how they affect those around him and who he loves, No Country for Old Men is a stunning film and one of the best of recent times."
lewiskendell,"Jul 12, 2010",10/10,"""You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.""Even if No Country for Old Men didn't have gorgeous cinematography, excellent pacing, a near perfect script, and an absolutely perfect cast, I still would have loved it for its tone. It's the most similar movie to Fargo that the Coens have done, and the similar theme of implacable and unfathomable violence in a rural American area (once again initiated by money) is one of the main reasons why I love the Coens so much.The breathtaking, empty setting of south Texas is a seamless compliment to the measured pace of the movie. No Country has suspense coming out of its ears, as each scene seems to somehow surpass the previous ones in measured tension. The overall quiet of the film only serves to magnify the eventual scenes of violence when they come, and the fact that you don't see everything happen on-screen keeps the viewer fully invested in the story. There's no constant quick cuts and hyper-kinetic camera work to be seen; only long-smoldering sequences that pushes your anticipation to the brink of breaking, and then pushes it some more.In a cast this good, two people stand out even beyond the others. Tommy Lee Jones as the world-weary sheriff who's the heart of the story, and Javier Bardem as the relentless, inscrutable, main antagonist of the story. Jones was perfect, there's no other way for me to say it. And Bardem gives life to the best and most interesting villain since The Operative in Serenity. Both performances were among the best that I've seen in my life.No County for Old Men is the kind of movie that improves with every viewing. Ten years from now, I'll still be watching it and loving it.  It's film-making at its finest. When you take an amazing story and marry it to directors with immeasurable talent and a cast that couldn't have been better chosen, you get a masterpiece."
plpregent,"Oct 20, 2011",10/10,"Not many films accomplish what No Country For Old Men does. Coming from the Coen brothers, this slice of western-influenced, 80's style storytelling just flows in front of your eyes at a slow yet enigmatic pace, delivering a form of tension that you rarely get to see in films nowadays.To your ears, this experience will seem very intense yet pretty minimal, especially in terms of music, which is pretty much absent from the ensemble, only to leave you with the calm sounds of the windy Texas desert, dry gun cockings, the brutal sound of Chigurh's infamous tank or silenced shotgun (doing bloody damage shown in all its graphic greatness!), among many, many others. Every footstep is a part of the experience, every gun shot sounds loud and lethal, every silence builds the tension, and the almost scientific pace of NCFOM.Nowadays, music dictating how you should feel and crescendos on queue with the jump-off-your-seat moments is a common thing. Music being absent, you are left with your own nerves, and the incredible tension generated by Javier Bardem's character, one of the coldest-blooded human beings ever portrayed on film, period. What ensues is so effective and precise, it's both completely badass AND cinematically stunning.You become quite worried about this poor kid, Moss, who's being ruthlessly chased by this complete psychopath who murders anyone stepping on his path without any visible kind of emotion. With basic yet brilliant subplots involving Moss' wife, the Mexican cartel, and an ageing sheriff losing control and confidence in this whole situation, this adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's novel will simply blow your mind if you have the slightest interest in either western cinema, genuine writing and storytelling, or minimalist cinema.Hell, whatever your favourite genre is, if you're not expecting Transformers or some other MTV-style blockbuster and have a minimal interest in auteur cinema, No Country For Old Men's experience will exceed any of your expectations.Now, what I previously called a ''subplot'' is, in fact, the whole core of the movie. It's Sheriff Bell's part. Again, it's very minimal, but it does dictate the whole narrative line of this film, and gives it its aura, its magic feeling of old people getting constantly bullied by the young, which is exactly why this film is called what it's called. And why you get this narration at the start, while witnessing some crude and cold violence, committed by a young man. Through two young men's classic western pursuit, you get an old man's struggle with the pain of getting old and feeling obsolete next to these younger, meaner wolves.This is why the ending is what it is as well. And what an ending this is! Pure brilliance. Had me smiling in admiration for 20 minutes after the film ended.A brilliant piece of cinema, just as incredible as Fargo was. Yet these are two very different films, they both shine with irresistible brilliance. Congratulations to this top-notch cast, these two incredible film-makers, this genius of a man who wrote this story, and to the whole team behind this modern-day masterpiece."
mjhalta,"Feb 29, 2008",6/10,"Once again Hollywood picks a movie as best picture that should be great but falls far short of the mark. Last years departed is another example. This movie is so full of holes it makes Bonnie and Clyde's car look like it just drove of the assembly line. The acting was so so but not great as is required to win an academy award. This movie reminded me of those slasher films where the killer shows up everywhere and kills everyone and leaves bodies everywhere and the cops are absolutely ineffective and useless. The one scene where the killer is fixing his own gun shot wound reminded me of other movies such as Terminator and Rambo, it's all been done before and better. To sum up, if you like violent action shows it's pretty good, if your looking for a movie that is Best Picture material this is not it."
LawrenceofAsia,"Nov 23, 2022",7/10,"A gripping violent chase story with some dark humor in it. A good guy (Sheriff by Tommy Lee Jones), a bad guy (Anton Chigurh by Javier Bardem), and a guy in between (Llewelyn Moss by Josh Brolin) chase one another after Moss takes the money from a botched drug trade crime scene.It is a simple story, but shot and made very stylishly. The characters and vast wild country environment (a character by itself) adds texture to the story. The film doesn't have a lot of dialogues, but rather establishes the characters from what they choose to do and how they choose to do it.One of the themes of the movie is how time and crime shifts in the west Texas. The movie is sandwiched by the sheriff's monologue at the beginning (how life was simpler and made sense in the old times; now he can't comprehend the senseless violence of contemporary crimes.) and his conversation with his uncle towards the end, about the illusion he feels and the disappointment of his inability to deal with this new kind of criminality. That is where the title comes from.Another theme is that you can't see (stop) what is coming. Anton Chigurh asks his potential victims to call a coin to decide whether to kill him/her or not. A woman by a motel pool flirts with Moss: That's who you keep looking out the window for? Moss replies: ""Just looking for what's coming."" The woman quips: ""Yeah, but no one ever sees that.""It is a movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat. But the ending is not very satisfying to me."
irish_joe,"Dec 9, 2012",9/10,"I decided to read Cormac McCarthys book before watching this movie adaptation, having been a big fan of his more recent novel The Road. I loved the book and ended up uncertain if I wanted to watch the movie as I it was hard to imagine the Coen brothers being able to do it justice. Overall though, I was impressed with their treatment of the story, both in following the text closely and in terms of playing out the author's intentions rather than undermining or erasing them.Having said that, there are some real differences between the two which to me meant the film didn't quite deliver on the story in the way the book did. Most of these differences probably came from a need to keep the running time down, but personally I would have been happy for the movie to be an hour longer and to follow more of the subplots of the book. The most important of those differences for me:â¢ In the book Carla Jean calls the coin toss incorrectly and Chigurh shoots her. They have pretty much the same conversation in both versions, but in the Coens version she refuses to call the toss forcing Chigurh to see it is he, not the coin, deciding her fate.â¢ The book explains why we meet Chigurh in jail, saying he permitted himself to be captured ""to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will"". Later Chigurh describes this as a vain, foolish act. These facts are not in the movie.â¢ The first hotel confrontation between Moss and Chigurh is altered in the movie; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, Chigurh takes a key from the murdered receptionist and enters Moss' room, where a hiding Moss takes him captive at gunpoint, so they have a chance to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the shootout begins.â¢ In the book Chigurh delivers the recovered cash to a man he's never met before, and a conversation ensues. In the film it is fairly unclear who Chigurh works for, which makes his character hard to understand.â¢ Where the film last sees Moss alive heading off to have a beer with a lady who calls to him from poolside at her hotel, the book has a whole subplot between him and a young female hitchhiker, to whom he gives money and advice. He actually dies because he puts down his gun when the Mexicans following him take her hostage. This was a big part of the development of the Moss character in the book, with it being clear that Moss was loyal to his wife and would not take advantage of the teenager even when propositioned, and afterwards the hanging question of what his wife would think when he was found dead in a motel with a teenage runaway.Anyway, book versus film aside, this movie features some truly brilliant performances, and is an astounding achievement in storytelling and filmmaking. Wonderful!"
sheepnumber34,"Dec 22, 2019",10/10,This is a great film.The story is brilliant. The acting is fantastic.Special mention to Javier....just wow. When someone gets a role like this right it should stay with you for life...and his performance does just that.I'm jealous of those who haven't seen it...you've got a gem there!!!
Sandcooler,"Mar 8, 2010",9/10,"This movie took a while to really get into, but once I did I was pretty overwhelmed. It isn't a classic fight between the good and the bad, it's more like a brilliant cat-and-mouse game between the unlikeable and the even more unlikeable. I felt bad for Llewellyn Moss, who had no idea about how far over his head he was, but he's mostly the hero because of the contrast with Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is the unstoppable evil, which is mainly apparent in the gas station scene, in which he decides the clerk's fate in a coin toss. It's so random, it has nothing to do with the main plot, but he wants to kill him because he can. That's the frightening thing about Chigurh, he does bad things for no reason. It's a brilliant character, and his cold-blooded antics give the movie a breakneck pace. The pseudo-intellectual ending scene is an anti-climax, but that's pretty much the only criticism I can give."
JetBanana,"Apr 16, 2008",9/10,"Hailed by thousands as an instant classic, and also hailed as a disaster by thousands more. It has been a while since a real 'artsy' type movie has been so successful at the Academy Awards, but this one is definitely deserving of all its glory.The film's central theme is not only a changing world, but the fact that the people who kept the world in order once before have seen their day and it has truly become 'No Country for Old Men'. With Tommy Lee Jones' opening and closing monologues, he beautifully exemplifies the point the story tries to make. It isn't easy to see, i assure you, which is why this isn't really a film for everyone. But deep meaning aside, the film also illustrates excellent use of suspense, character interaction, and amazing direction.It has been said that a single emotion can be the drive behind a story, and the emotion that really gets you while watching this film is fear. The Coen brothers brilliantly used fear to shape Javier Bardem's character as the 'psychopathic killer'. When he comes on the screen you get a sense of a dark shadow casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil.I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it is definitely worth your time."
No-CountryForOldMen,"Mar 30, 2011",10/10,"Well , i watched this movie without blinking . It is so exciting with great acting . Seriously i couldn't believe that a masterpiece like this really exists . These guys that reviewed before me don't appreciate and don't know what a real quality movies are . Coen brothers are simply awesome ! It really deserved an Oscar unlike the stupid Hurt Locker . Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are both class A actors . Well if you want to see a genius Coen bros movie , my advice to you is to concentrate while watching this movie and you will definitely see its best qualities .Peace"
CinemaSerf,"Nov 26, 2022",7/10,"Javier Bardem is just great in this! He is ""Anton"", a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic ""Moss"" (Josh Brolin) after a drug deal goes awry. The latter man soon cottons onto the fact that his life is now considerably more at risk and he has to figure just out how to survive long enough to escape and enjoy his cash. ""Moss"" might just have an unlikely and unwitting ally, though, in the form of the pursuing but rather unenthusiastic sheriff ""Bell"" (Tommy Lee Jones) but, well you just wouldn't want to bet against the truly menacing Bardem! It's violent and brutal, sure - but it's also darkly humorous with plenty of pithy banter and quite some degree of characterisation from both Brolin and Bardem as the denouement looms large. That conclusion is as unpredictable as the rest of this quirkily scary and entertaining crime drama that uses an oxygen cylinder with startlingly effective results in this game of lethal Russian Roulette. Nobody is safe, nobody is innocent - and it doesn't matter whose side you are, ostensibly, on either. It's perfectly paced by the Coen brothers, the characters and the story given ample opportunity to develop and to breathe and by the conclusion I was definitely rooting for someone! It has shades of the old wild-west Texan Western genre to it, it reeks of authenticity and is really well worth a watch."
Nadja-6,"Mar 14, 2008",1/10,"I hated it. It's the first time I've had to say that Tommy Lee was not in a good movie. :-( I did not feel that the character development was good for anyone but Lewellyn and his wife. You really got to know and like Lewellyn, and then abruptly he's gone. We didn't see enough of his wife. Tommy Lee's performance was fine, but he was hard to understand most of the time. What's with Woody's character? Why was it even a part of the movie, it didn't really add anything to it. They could have left out all the scenes with the guy who hires him, too, and it would not have changed the movie. Anton has no redeeming qualities and is quite boring as a character. All in all I was very disappointed with a movie that got so many accolades."
gozu,"Jan 4, 2008",10/10,"I saw a trailer for this movie a long time ago and I had a good feeling about it. I then forgot it completely. I'm glad because I was able to watch it now without any idea of what the plot was like and I experienced every twist and turn in the plot as it was meant to be.My review won't be long because it doesn't need to. This movie is one of the few that never annoy. It delivers only stellar acting and memorable characters and a plot full of inventive and satisfying twists and turns that keep you surprised all the way through, just like real life. That is the movie's biggest achievement.It's an instant classic and an absolute must-watch for all.

TheTheatreKidFrom90s,"Feb 17, 2010",10/10,"There a lot of people who hate the movie, not just disliked, they hate! Look at reviews or visit the forums, you will see. Art house movies are unconventional generally, but for No Country for Old Men is not an art house film, but it is not a blockbuster too. It is both, I mean artistic and at the same time entertaining. I know that the people who hate it would not call it entertainment, because they were not entertained. Then, why haters hate this movie? Because it is not a crowd pleaser? Well, firstly, they say that the movie was very dull, very very slow paced. If you ask me, the time flies by, I did not get bored at all. I was hypnotized, mesmerized. By the way, do you know what is one of the most frustrating things about this movie for me? Some people say this is inferior in comparison with Fargo or Blood Simple. I watched both movies and I am really sorry, but I enjoyed both movies, both are must- see experiences, but they are, Fargo, Blood Simple were just good movies to me, no more than that. A critics says that cinema feeling in There will be Blood was more strong than No Country for Old Men. How funny, I liked There will be Blood very much, but think just the opposite. The cinema of Old Men is more powerful than There will be Blood. Old Men is pure cinema. Another critic says that I would not call the movie masterpiece, because ultimately, a man pursues another man, this is the story. Well, this was what I wanted anyway, but also this is just the surface. The directors don't use background music (unconventional), I loved that, but this is the second complaint as I see. It makes the movie dull according to the haters. It causes me hypnotized. Many people like noisy, fast movies, this is the fact, isn't it? but why? Was Casablanca noisy or fast? No. Then, is it a movie to be hated? As for Javier Bardem, his performance, acting is appreciated even by the haters, otherwise I would kill myself anyway. Joking aside, you will think that I exaggerate, but no, to me, his performance, acting is one of the best ones of all time and his character is one of the best villains so far too. What Day Lewis is in There will be Blood, Bardem is in No Country for Old Men. A superhuman performance. Just by one scene, it can be understood. In one of the most disturbing scenes, even if off screen, I mean his last visit, after that, in the car, look at his face! It tells a lot of things. The opening scene of the movie is one of the greatest opening scenes ever made! In terms of content, it is horrible, in terms of cinema, it is great. In this scene, Bardem is at one of the zeniths of his performance by the way. To watch this character, Anton Chigurh was very entertaining, very interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes evil, horrible. One of the reasons that I love the movie is this, I mean, The Brothers created a great character, to be more precise, they adapted the character in a perfectionist way from the novel. As for Chigurh's weapons, forbidding, horrible, weird, but also inventive. I knew Josh Brolin by this movie, I can't remember him in The Goonies, I watched it when I was a child but. Therefore, I liked the actor very much including his character. After that I watched him in American Gangster and he was great in that movie. In this movie, he is in Bardem's shadow, but still does a great job. He was an interesting character too. On average, how many favorite scenes you have in a movie? No Country for Old Men is an exception for me, because if I count my favorite scenes, it makes almost the whole movie. All the scenes Bardem appears are my favorites once. I will mention some of them. The scene that he tries to find the bag by the device, the scene that he carries out first aid to himself (this scene also tells somethings about the personality of the character, he is really a psychopath, he seems panicked, he cares about himself, his health very much), the scene that he makes a sudden attack to the hotel, again a horrible, but in terms of direction, a fresh, great scene. I had not been on pins and needles like that in another movie. There are several reasons for that. For example, Anton Chigurh is like T-1000 from The Terminator 2. In some moments, I said to myself that's it! or something like that in theater. Now do you understand why I love that? As for the sheriff (our bonus Tommy Lee Jones), the first sheriff character on screen who is unwilling to solve the cases, catch the bad guys (unconventional and brilliant) And, as the third complaint, a few unexpected twists that take place near the final. It might be unsatisfying, but it was realistic and shocking. Everything does not work out the way we expect it will."
jmholmes-73727,"May 1, 2019",9/10,"Will try to write about the one, but significant miscalculation, at the movie's end - without making this a ""spoiler."" Here goes: when you get to the final pages in McCarthy's novel, you can see it's winding down, so you begin to read slowly, being sure to take everything in - you can, of course, see that the typing stops in a few paragraphs and you know it's about to end. But when you get to this final scene in the movie version, the viewer has no such advance warning, so as the lead character reaches the end of his speech about a dream he's had, and the screen goes dark, the movie's end seems abrupt and un-satisfying. The Coens could have easily solved this problem by visualizing the dream, showing it with the speaker's voice on the soundtrack. Would have made for a much more cinematic finish. Still, that being said, this is a masterpiece - and one of those rare instances when the Oscar actually did go to the best picture of the year."
Samiam3,"May 15, 2010",10/10,"As I sat in the theatre, about halfway through No Country for Old Men, I distinctly remember whispering to the person next to me this was Oscar gold. Little did I know that he was asleep. If nothing else, it just goes to show how peoples tastes vary, but I cannot imagine how anyone could fall asleep. This is a film that gets you hooked from scene one, and right until the ending, it is steeped in suspense, black humour, great direction and acting and it ain't afraid to get its hands dirty.Based on Cormack McCarthy's novel, No Country for Old Men dictates one simple truth. There is evil in the world, there always has been and there always will be. The previous generation of crime fighters including Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) are no match for a new generation of criminals, at the start of a new decade (the eighties). One such criminal is Anton Chigurth, who kills people with a pneumatic air gun. This strange fella is going after two million dollars in drug money which has been stolen by Llewelyn Moss. He is an ordinary Texan who just happens to stumble upon the after math of a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert. He finds the money, and tries to figure out how to get him and his wife clear and safe. Meanwhile, the Mexican drug dealers, The Law, and Chigurth are all coming after him.It is all the little details in the film which are what contribute to its high quality. I'll give you a great example. No Country for Old Men, is sucked almost completely dry of music. In one or two scenes, there is a very soft synthesizer drone, but the silence is far more potent. Alfred Hitchcock with the Birds was the last time I saw a music-free feature film.No Country for Old Men is not for the soft of heart, or the squeamish, but it will be embraced by anyone and everyone who can appreciate great cinema. Though unfortunately it is not a very popular movie (or at least it wasn't when it came out), I have a feeling No Country for Old Men will age well."
s13ky,"Jul 15, 2013",7/10,"I have no doubt that the Coen brothers, despite being somewhat irregular, have talent. Following their work wonders such as ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Barton Fink"" and ""Fargo"", they are now hogging all the awards with a Western-like thriller that features a not too original story though really exciting.The game of cats and dogs or cats and mice (call it what you want) is the basis of the plot, simple, nothing new but please note how the Coen brothers packed the story into a good film. We can almost all say that ""No Country for Old Men"" has all it takes to be a great film.Let's start from its hypnotic photography. It's really brutal with near- desert landscapes that reminds us of the glorious days of classic western films. Next, we continue with its amazing soundtrack, or the awesome script, full of goodies and other nice treats.The cast is also well-chosen, the indescribable chemistry between the cool Josh Brolin and pure evil Javier Bardem is simply spectacular. We should also remember Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson (in a short but flawless performance) as supporting casts.Another best thing about this film would be its perfectly measured pace. The script is just beautifully structured. I love how Joel and Ethan Coen alternate the situations through some clever film direction and editing, slowing down and speeding up at times. I also adore the visualized violence, brutal but still not gory.In conclusion, ""No Country For Old Men"" offers us a realistic approach and meticulous details so that beneath a classic Western action format so that not only do they revitalize the Western genre, but also making it a raw and unique experience."
adamonIMDb,"Sep 5, 2017",9/10,"The Coen brothers have given us many great movies, but 'No Country for Old Men' has to be my favourite of theirs. This film is 10 years old now but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better piece of entertainment released since. It's an enthralling watch from start to finish and one of the most memorable and unique movies of its time. Maybe it's a bold claim, but I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s.'No Country for Old Men' scores top marks in all areas, but the best part of the film for me is the characters and dialogue exchanges between them. Anton Chigurh in particular is a fascinating character and is brilliantly portrayed by Javier Bardem.The ending has proved divisive among fans, but I'm in the 'liked it' camp. Finishing with the 'old man' of the movie retiring is fitting with the title and was also suitably low-key. A brilliant film all round."
awwatkin,"May 9, 2025",7/10,"I am giving this movie a rating of 7. It's a 6, but it gets an extra point for the supporting/bit roles which were unbelievably well cast. I don't think this movie should have won any academy awards unless it was for the local color people cast, but it is what it is. The story is just that of a drug deal gone bad where a guy that has nothing to do with it finds the money and is then hunted. It's a good movie.....it's a little too long, but it's a good movie, even though it's a story that has been told many times. I won't give away the ending, but I'll just say it's not really completely wound up....maybe they're thinking of a sequel?"
stillworkingfortheknife,"Jan 5, 2013",N/A,"This is actually one of the best book adaptions ever. It's almost impossible to tell a story accurately with such little dialogues and without a narrator voice, but the Coen brothers accomplished it fantastically. A perfect cast till minor roles and Javier Bardem makes one of the best film villains of all time! The style of the film is absolutely unique and the mixture of western, thriller and satire is excellent. The ending is realistic and leaves a couple of questions open, which makes you think a lot about the film afterwards. Everything seems sophisticated, even how scenes succeed on one another and that's what is so fantastic about this movie. Everything that happens in No Country For Old Men keeps your eyes peeled on the TV screen, even if it's just normal dialogue. I.e. the showdown between Chigurh and Moss, which is one of the most thrilling scenes I've seen lately or the Chigurh's conversation with the gas station proprietor which is absolutely awesome. The screenplay, the direction and Javier Bardem totally deserved the Oscar. There were better movies in 2006 but this flick is a very favorable tale about bad people that is both confusing and stunning."
ronakkotian,"Feb 25, 2021",10/10,"After seeing a couple films from The Coen Brothers during the last few months, I couldn't believe how amazing and talented they are as filmmakers. Inside Llewyn Davis was my favourite Coen Brothers film until now.No Country for Old Men entwines the lives of a hunter, a sheriff and a killer in Texas when a drug deal goes wrong and a bag full of cash is involved.With No Country for Old Men, The Coen Brothers revisit the Wild West but this time with a modern spin to it and I dug it all the way through. This has quickly become my favourite Coen Brothers film so far and with how high this film sets the bar, it will be really difficult to top this in my opinion. This is easily the darkest film I've seen from them and they do a great job establishing that. The gorgeous lighting and dark colour tones create an eerie and brooding atmosphere to this world. I also noticed early on the absence of music which was a choice that felt very purposeful and added to the tension. I don't think I've ever felt so tense during a film before. There were countless scenes where I felt my heart beating faster than ever before and it's due to the spectacular editing and direction by the Coens. This film is a great example of how you don't need music to make a scene more dramatic or intense.The performances are all fantastic. Josh Brolin gives one of his best here. He nails the accent plays Llewelyn Moss to the best of his ability. Tommy Lee Jones is equally terrific. There's so much going on with his character and he plays such an essential role to the themes of the film which I believe he fulfilled. The actor who really stands out here is Javier Bardem in the best performance of his career. Bardem embodies the menacing yet odd nature of Anton Chigurh so perfectly. It's a career-defining performance that won't be forgotten. Kelly Macdonald is amazing despite her short role and nails the accent completely. Woody Harrelson also does a great job with his role.I should have seen the ending coming considering how The Coen Brothers never go down the traditional route. It may disappoint some people but I found it to be thought-provoking. In many ways it made me think over the entire film and what it was trying to say. On the surface level this film may just be a suspense thriller but beneath that there are many layers to each character and situation. Like many of the Coens' films, there's so much to think about and discuss and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon.All in all, No Country for Old Men is a Coen Brothers masterpiece. It's dark, gritty and suspenseful throughout with exquisite filmmaking and exceptional writing. Anton Chigurh is one of the most interesting and enigmatic villains I've been exposed to and I cannot wait to watch it again and analyse it to a further degree."
BendsOTheBow,"May 16, 2023",10/10,"The movie that ""broke"" my perspective. It took me a while to see this movie, about midway through highschool, and as a result I had no idea what I witnessed. I'd never before seen a movie defy standards like it did up until then. There are three main characters, who are all played flawlessly. There is borderline no music, yet after watching it I can't imagine where it would fit. The ending is unexpected and it plays out like the end of an Ernest Hemingway novel. I don't know if I could find anything wrong with the movie if I tried, truly. The Coens are masters of their craft, and their adaptation of this Cormac McCarthy novel is a testament to that."

The acting is great, the dialogue is fantastic, the cinematography is beautiful, but the thing that takes this film to a whole new level is the suspense. Every second of suspense I wish was hours. When a bullet is shot you feel it. You feel like your in the shoes of the guy getting shot at. Everything is just so well done. You'll need time to breath after watching it because you don't want to take one breath while suspense is building. A lot of people complained about the ending I didn't mind it. Overall No Country for Old Men is a great piece of cinema that will get your heart racing.4 stars out of 4"
stowbury,"Jan 31, 2008",6/10,"We've seen all this before and didn't really need to see it again. The ingredients in terms of the characters are very similar to Fargo - 1. Ruthless psychopathic killer(s), 2. Ordinary guy with bad motives getting into something over his head, 3. A good-hearted cop, outwardly unimpressive and seemingly impotent in the face of the evil thuggery let loose in the neighbourhood but clever and wise, trying to piece together what's going on and prevent tragedy. The story this time around however is thin and over-familiar - an obsessive vengeful quest, a duel between hunter and hunted that occupies most of the film. The characters too are dull in comparison to their Fargo counterparts. Despite the trademark style and quirky flourishes this is by and large a plodding, predictable exercise in ritualistic machismo. I didn't really care who got killed and when. It is not a masterpiece or even a return to form. The best moment was early on when the old almost retired sheriff and his young sidekick survey the bloody aftermath of a criminal deal gone wrong and exchange banter in theorising about what happened. Instead of developing the younger cop's part the scriptwriter casts it aside half-way through and with it goes much of the interest in the older cop too. The trail of violence runs its course and some empty banalities uttered by the world-weary lawman that pass for significant wisdom bring the proceedings to a close."
kazumi90,"Jan 20, 2008",N/A,"Wouldn't it be funny if the Coen brothers primary objective was not to make a work of art but rather, a social experiment.Create a superbly crafted film based mainly on graphic violence and see what the public reaction is -- sort of a litmus test to shine a light on our collective mental health. Possibly a way to understand the limits of our fixation on violence.The Coens are just brilliant enough to possibly pull-off something like this.And judging from the orgasmic praise this movie has received from the intelligista, it seems we might be in deep trouble."
falloutboy72,"May 22, 2011",8/10,"No Country for Old Men is a rare movie that gets every aspect of film perfectly. Every character gives an award deserving performance? Yes. The script perfect? Yes. The cinematography, the directing, the camera angles? Yes, yes and yes.No Country for Old Men starts with a very creepy Javier Bardem who is chasing Brolin's character (who is very much deserving the academy award). The Coen Brothers nail the atmosphere of a modern western. The filming is done in Texas, and if it wasn't for the cars, you would think its a classic western. The sets, everything from the desolate wilderness, to the run down motels, fit in perfectly with an excellent atmosphere. The script sets up a very tense film, a chase between three different characters.I am almost positive that you will be entertained while watching this movie. It is one of the best of the 2000's."
dmdavidsonhome-267-593710,"Feb 3, 2012",10/10,"No Country for Old Men is one those rare films that I not only never tire of watching, but actually seems to improve with each viewing. I have found that some people have not taken the time to see it simply because of the violent content. What a great shame and pity that they would miss out on and deny themselves a truly marvelous viewing experience. I don't recall people staying away from The Godfather because of the violence. To me it is not the violence but the sense of menace and dread that makes No Country for Old Men such a tension-filled nail biter and a truly edge-of-your-seat film. Everyone I have talked to who has actually seen it used the words "" very tense"" and ""it kept me on the edge-of-my-seat"". Javier Bardem's ""Anton Chigurh"" is the greatest screen villain since ""Hannibal Lecter"". Tommy Lee Jones played a very understated character in ""Sheriff Ed Tom Bell"", who is the conscience of the film. Josh Brolin was also excellent and vastly underrated as ""Llewelyn Moss"", the hunter who unwittingly becomes the hunted. The lovely Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald is also great in an all-too-small role as ""Carla Jean Moss"" (""Llewelyn""'s wife). She does a flawless West Texas accent. Woody Harrelson is also superb as the somewhat mysterious ""Carson Wells"", who we never really learn a lot about. Gene Jones is so superb and so memorable as a country store proprietor in a truly unforgettable scene. The Coen Brothers did a splendid job of adapting the book to the big-screen and their casting of even the smallest roles was flawless. I would not recommend reading the book by Cormac McCarthy before watching the film, as it would spoil some of the film's surprises. However I found that the book did clear up some of the things that the film did not explain in full detail. A great film based on a great book. It has fast become one of my favorites and I always recommend it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it. And the film's Oscar-winning cinematography by Roger Deakins makes it well-worth getting the Blu-Ray version and watching it on a big screen. The harsh and inhospitable West Texas landscape makes for a stunning background. No Country for Old Men may not be a perfect film but it comes as close as any I have ever seen in my nearly 53-years."
drqshadow-reviews,"Mar 26, 2012",9/10,"I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing."
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Feb 8, 2020",9/10,"A Gruelling, unapologetically raw and, for better or worse, draining crime thriller. No country for old men benefits greatly from its immersive cinematography, Cohen-esque script, and a scene-stealingly visceral performance from Javier Bardem --- making for a well paced narrative, that twists and turns its way to a conclusion that will satisfy you in the most bittersweet way.

come2whereimfrom,"Jan 13, 2008",6/10,"A huge fan of their early work and pretending that the last few films they made didn't happen I had high expectations for Joel and Ethan Coen's latest project. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel 'No Country' is a return to form for the sibling filmmakers or at least it is for the first hour and a half. What starts off with some amazing cinematography and a Tommy Lee Jones voice-over boils over into a frenzied chase movie that has genuine tension running through its every pore and then sadly it doesn't really have an ending and all the good things that have come before seem somewhat spoilt. Javier Bardem is amazingly creepy as sociopath Anton Chigurh, his hair nearly as bizarre as his favourite method of killing, every line he delivers is unnerving and yet you hang off his every word. Josh Brolin Is great as Llewelyn Moss the Welder turned wanted man after he stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and steals a case full of money so he and his wife can start a new life. Cue every man and his dog, literally, after Moss from cops to Mexicans and of course Nutcase extraordinaire Anton. There is very little screen time for either Lee Jones or Harrelson and if you blink you could be forgiven for missing either of their performances. There are some beautiful shots, some great lines and a fitting score but it is by no means perfect which is a shame. But for the most part the Coen's flourishes can be seen and there is nearly as much tension and suspense as there is blood but with such a strange ending and so many loose ends like not actually telling the viewer what happened or why I feel they still have some way to go to regain former glories, but this is at least a start."

So odd I didn't think I'd ever remember the name of the film - but I did after repeating it over and over to myself so the movie would not become a ""good but lost film"" for me.If you like Crime-Dramas and Thrillers then look no further than this film.

tommdennehy,"Oct 10, 2022",6/10,"Having watched this originally in 2008, I wondered what all the fuss was about. And now having watched it again 14 years later, I wonder the same.Yes there are some good performances and yes it's a reasonable story. However, surely for a movie or any story really to really grab you, one has to care. One has to care about at least one of the characters and some of the associated outcomes.None of the characters have any redeeming features really. So this rather slow and ploddy film leaves you unsatisfied and wanting more. Maybe that's the point? Maybe it's meant to be a little more reflective of life itself. A little unsatisfactory?Either way, maybe I'll give it a try in another 14 years?"
s_a_n_d_w_i_c_h_e_s,"Jan 14, 2008",N/A,"This film is rubbish but before I start talking about how rubbish it is I have to tell you something which you must understand and be aware of. If you haven't seen this rubbish film then you shouldn't read what I am about to write because I have written some talking which have details all about almost all of the plot. I would suggest most pleasantly that you DO NOT READ THIS because it will be bad for you and will spoil things in this movie.A lot of people have been tricked into liking this film because this is one of those films that tries to make you think it's better than it actually is, but if you think about it you will see it's rubbish. Everybody mumbles or wails like pigeons. I wish I could make sounds on this website to explain.It's all about a man who finds some money and runs off. He's being chased by a man who wants to kill him and steal his money. This man has weird hair that hangs off his head like yesterday's tacos and he is annoying to look at. He mumbles so nobody knows what he is saying. He carries a silly little toy (that is actually massive) that kills people with little puffs of air (as if air could kill people LOL!). He is being chased by a crooked old man who is a sheriff who always looks like he's about to cry. The man with the money even has a wife (she's the one who sounds like a pigeon) who looks miserable and has a face like a wedge of cheese. There are WAY TOO MANY characters in this film.What is also rubbish is that we never see what's happening because the camera is pointing in the wrong direction for all the exciting stuff like killings and explosions. It takes 10 boring minutes of planning an explosion and then when it happens it's in the background and we can't see it properly. When everyone gets killed at the end (which is rubbish) the camera is pointing at the sheriff driving a car, and WE DON'T EVEN SEE IT HAPPEN! LOL it's like a space movie where everyone sits in a room and then someone comes in and says we've just come back from space and we had a big fight with some aliens. That would be rubbish and this film is just like that."

aciessi,"Oct 18, 2017",10/10,"The Coen Bros. have had their heyday long before the release of No Country for Old Men. Had they left the 90's burnt out, it would've been completely understandable. But 10 years ago, they crafted an ingenious comeback by making perhaps the most convincing, powerful film about pure evil in history. No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest films ever made.. but you already knew that. I'm sort of late to catching up to this one and I regret it entirely. Visually speaking, it captures the darkness of our world in ways no film has ever been capable of. In terms of acting, it absolutely soars. Broiln and Jones are incredible. Javier Bardem is terrifying as Anton. He eats at your soul. As far as films that depict serial killers, this is as real as it gets. Right down to his weapon of choice, an air-powered captive bolt gun. The savagery is what gets me the most.No Country for Old Men explains to us in no uncertain terms how malicious and conniving humanity can be. What's even better is the fact that movies like these aren't rare to come by. They've been made time and again. The Coens just decided to make one more. Bless them for it."
f-62204-72175,"May 22, 2023",8/10,"No country for old men isn't for everyone. It's a very violent movie and when I say this, I really mean it. The violence on this movie is really rare to find nowadays. And I wouldn't really called it an action movie, because there is more killing than actual fights. Now this is just a taste of what you will see on this film. Know if I had to pick the best part of this movie it has to be the acting, especially from the actor that plays Anton. There is an real studie where a psychiatrist went through all the movies with psychopaths to see which one is the best interpretation of a psycho. And guess who was it? Anton. Which is funny since the actor is a known pacifist and even thought on refusing the role, but thankfully he didn't. The story is also great and the direction makes the tension really high and the movie makes you can't stop watching it until the end. Talking about the end,that's unfortunately where this movie fails. I know that alot of people defend it has a deeper meaning behind but, honestly I still think they could have made a more conclusive ending and not try to make it so abstract. At the end of the day one of the best movies ever but unfortunately not perfect."
profparadox-30001,"Jul 10, 2020",9/10,"I haven't watched a lot of westerns and neither am I familiar with a lot of Mexican stand-offs but I do know of them. From a plot view, the movie is amazing because it is a western without being only a western. No Country for Old Men shines in its own light. The classic good guy bad guy situation looms over the whole movie but is never the central theme. The third main character, the sheriff really makes us understand what the movie is about. I wanna say a lot more things but can't give away the spoilers.Coming to the acting, it's just phenomenal. It is hard to point out flaws in the scenes it portrays and the actors who portray it. Tommy Lee Jones is reserved and is still looking back to the simpler times, the story for him is the theme of the movie for me. The movie's cinematography doesn't spark shock but rather visuals scare us, even the scenic landscape looks deadly. It gives the audience a chance to be a part of the movie. That's where the movie shines out."

On the pro side it started out and pretty much developed as a good story line and it had some good acting talent. Bad men. Moral issues. Tommy Lee Jones was on his way to a good film and then the script failed him and he just rolled over, so I guess he needed the money. I like Tommy Lee but this was his worst effort. The best acting in this otherwise awful movie was the baddest of the bad guys who is an actor most of us have not seen before. Javier Bardem's character will make you want to sleep with a loaded shotgun in your bed tonight. Overall the movie started out with basically good underpinnings.... and kept you interested for almost 2 hours.... and then it all fell apart in the last 5 minutes. An absolutely horrible ending. I only hope that Javier Bardem is out looking for the Coens so he can blast them like his other targets! The story builds suspense and characters and then it is like the Cohens ran out of production money, ideas, talent and interest... all at the same time. Save your money now and even later when it comes out as a DVD."
RevSykes,"Nov 13, 2007",N/A,"Maybe I'm admitting to old fogey-hood, but, to me, this movie is bad for society, though it's effective, disturbing cinema. I can see two powerful fallouts from it: 1) people with a violence problem have found a new hero. The movie makes it seem realistic that this Terminator-like avenger could actually be that continually successfully lethal and impregnable. Someone will channel that guy. 2) Is anyone going to stop to help a stranger after seeing this? Is anyone actually going to want to interact in any way with a stranger??? These points, though heartfelt, are somewhat ironic. The movie could also be looked at as a statement ABOUT our society which glamorizes violence. Yes, it was effective, but I worry about its impact"
eric_clapton1955,"Feb 24, 2012",10/10,"This movie is one of the best I have seen and it is all due to the psychological killer Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. There is no real logic in his actions as he uses a coin in his decision making process (especially when he is going to kill somebody). He does this in a very cold way as if it is a matter of deciding in which restaurant am I going to eat today. This is something that I think gives him strength as he never doubts his actions, there is no second guessing. Of course this is a very sick individual. But there is a twist which I am not going to reveal here. Also the move hides a powerful message between the lines. For me it has a deep meaning when it comes to faith and chance. The character played by Tommy Lee Jones is also a powerful one."
Branz_Reviews,"Jun 13, 2021",10/10,"No Country For Old Men is one of the greatest movies I've seen of Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones and a great first for Javier Bardem. I throughly enjoyed this movie, down to the last scene i thought it was well thought out and the way they keep you engaged in the story is truly phenomenal. This isn't your average crime thriller, this story shows you just how much stuff can go wrong when you stumble on a drug deal gone wrong and find a large amount of cash, what could go wrong.. that is with a tracker involved which makes it all the more exciting to see who lives and who dies in this epic tale of greed and out right bizarre criminals. Talking of criminals it is very criminal that I hadn't seen this, I was so entertained by every aspect of it and I have so many regrets that I didnt catch it sooner.The mind games are so iconic in this that Javier Bardem plays as Anton Chigurh, my favourite scene was the gas station, I don't involved spoilers in my reviews so that's all I'll say but I found it so chilling in the best way possible. If I caught this in the cinema I cant begin to imagine how insane it would be! Such an experience it would've been, although this was a great experience nevertheless.Highly recommend this!"
saadanathan,"Jun 29, 2021",8/10,"""No Country for Old Men"" is a brutal masterpiece. It depicts perfectly the horror and violence that America lives in. Usually the Coen Brothers' movies are dark comedies such as ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". This time, Ethan and Joel Coen have decided to make a full dark movie in terms of: genre, image and tone.The movie centers around Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who finds two million in cash after stumbling upon a drug deal gone wrong. What may seem as a happy ending turns out to be a cat and mouse game between Moss, the cartels and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hitman who is a psychopath. (no better way to describe him). The story follows Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the sheriff of the town who investigates the case of Moss, Bell is supposed to represent the old generation of the country that had more morality, so it's because of the things he witnesses that he is retiring from his job, the world is too brutal for an old man like him, thus the title of the film.What most interested me was Chigurh's character, we as the audience see him only from the outside and know nothing about him, we know nothing about his background story nor how he became a hitman, his childhood or anything actually. He is definitely the type of character you want to explore more of. Overall this is a great movie, normally I wouldn't expect something brutal as this to come from the brothers but I'm mostly impressed."
maxren17,"Dec 15, 2013",10/10,"I read some if the reviews that hated this movie. They all complained there was no story. I can't believe they missed it. The only thing I can say is the movie tells the ""story"" as it was written in the book. I think for many the fact that there's unresolved conflict is what causes them to feel there's no story. I saw the movie in the theater and was so moved by it I had to read the book which is even better than the movie. The movie and the book are very unconventional. Carmac McCarthy has a style of writing that's elusive and heavy with symbolism and that's told in a manner that makes it feel common place and real. His setting is Texas and his characters are everyday people from the region.There was one reviewer who didn't understand the story and his questions were clearly explained. Maybe he stepped away at some point and missed some important scenes in the movie.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it. It's incredibly disturbing. More of a horror movie than a crime drama. Years later I can watch this movie and still be blown away by the simplicity and deep emotional impact of the story."
kikoydaba3,"Aug 23, 2019",9/10,"No Country for Old Men is an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness. Led by an all-time great performance from Javier Bardem playing a macabre character in Anton Chigurh, the film is a heart pounding non-stop manhunt packing enough emotional wallop while successfully exploring its themes.Set near the US-Mexico Border, the film can be considered as a cautionary tale about the War on Drugs which has raged for decades. Motivated by greed Llewelyn Moss, played by Josh Brolin, takes off after finding a bag of cash on a site of failed transaction resulting to massacre. Unbeknown to him, placed inside is a tracker. Anton Chigurh hunts down Llewelyn Moss for the money. As the hunt progresses, snippets of dialogue and character interactions show that Chigurh is not evil, but merely a servant of death or death itself. Guided by a twisted philosophy, Chigurh kills because of fate and destiny. Moss sends away his wife and mother-in-law as the hunt becomes not merely about the money but also personal. Other characters appear to further provide insight and growth such as Woody Harrelson, who warns Moss that facing Chigurh is a death sentence. No character is as important to carry the film on an emotional level as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played Tommy Lee Jones. Embodying the hopelessness pervasive throughout the film, Sheriff Ed is an active participant in the manhunt aiming to prevent it. Despite his efforts, people die. Anyone who faces Chigurh dies. His scenes throughout the manhunt are beautiful, sad and introspective. Already an old man near retirement during the course of the film, the ending where he is retired perfectly captures the essence of his arc losing all hope living in world where death is unstoppable.While No Country is an excellent play about its themes, it lacks a true emotional anchor that carries the movie. Llewelyn Moss and Sheriff Tom aren't particularly engaging characters that captures the viewer's empathy.The Coen Brothers also bring technical qualities that complement the story. Wide and barren shots to portray a sense of epic scope, an almost non-existent score to build tension naturally and violence fitting for the antagonist.No Country for Old Men is a must see not only for its antagonist but as a whole.9/10"
davidddt,"Jun 28, 2009",10/10,"Loved it from beginning to end. The Cohen Brothers are nuts. They produce the best and weirdest movies on the planet. Never a dull moment, the movie has you on edge from beginning to end. I really don't get the casting of Tommy Lee Jones but no doubt they had a good reason for choosing him as the country sheriff.I have only watched it once so far but I have no doubt I will see more in it after a few more viewings. My first impression is that the Cohens have produced another classic every bit as good as Fargo or The Big Lebowski.Not a lot of dialog but what there is holds the story together without imposing on what is essentially a visual movie."
anthonyjlangford,"Feb 3, 2010",8/10,"There are some things you should know about Old Country for Old Men. It is based upon the book by Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy. It is directed by the Coen Brothers. It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, (Sea Inside, Dancer Upstairs). It has been nominated for Best Picture for the Golden Globes and one would expect the same for the Oscars.Put simply, this is the Coen's best film since Fargo. This is a tense, uncomfortable film for all the right reasons, it's the effect most thrillers should but rarely offer. And yet there are subtle elements which lift it above the level of thriller which may leave fans of straight fare confused. To say more would be too revealing.Typically for the Coen brothers, it's very violent, but this only adds weight to Bardem's extraordinary performance, alone worth the admission price.The photography of the Southern American desert is graceful but spectacular and sits non intrusively alongside the narrative.'Rising' star Josh Brolin (Into the Blue, Goonies) is great to watch and you'll be pulling for him even though he's risking it all for the cash. Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones in a role not too dissimilar, in feel at least, to his directorial Three Burials.There are other performances of note, including Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald (Trainspotting), but this is a showdown between Brolin and Bardem, with the Coens' hunching eagerly behind both. It's one of cinema's most enthralling battles.What else do you need to know? Zilch.(Review written at time of release)."
iamingozi,"Mar 16, 2008",6/10,"I have to say that this movie was intriguing, full of surprises and more violent than I expected. And although I suppose I understand the intentions of the plot, as convoluted as it was, I am kind of disheartened that it won so many academy awards. It's not just that it was full of errors (check the goof section), nor is it that in my own humble unprofessional opinion that although Javier Bardem was great, I saw no acting that was worth the award - I just don't think the role was written well enough to support it. But most of all, I really don't know what to make of anything anymore when a film of such overwhelming violence is put on such a coveted pedestal. Yes, I am aware that there have been other violent movies that have won, and maybe it is just the sad revelation that as I get older, what we see as entertainment - strike that - what we see as THE BEST of entertainment, is still nothing more than useless violence that carries with it no repercussions for the guilty. The film industry rarely gives us what we need, but feeds us over the top with what we shouldn't have; glorifying theft, betrayal, greed, and as we see in our latest best picture, murder. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. Personally I can handle the violence and all the other garbage, but I also believe the more graphic and blatant our so called entertainment becomes, the less value it must have. But as I said, this is just my unprofessional opinion, so I'll end this ""review/rant"" with this; if you are in the mood for a story full of death, some of it implied, some of it right there for you to enjoy - and if you are itching for a movie with no happy or justifiable ending, leaving you feeling like you went on a ride that was supposed to be the best ever but was really just sitting in your car parked in your garage with the motor running, then by all means...Enjoy!"
marihef,"Feb 17, 2008",N/A,"This nihilistic death fantasy by the Coen brothers is a real disappointment. It is structurally impossible to believe, and its incoherent ending left me feeling nothing short of defrauded. Don't take anyone you care about to see this truly depressing show, unless, of course, you think they'd enjoy watching scene after scene of prolonged acts of sadistic murder as the apparently invisible killer (he literally vanishes from the street after being blasted with buckshot) drifts freely through a naive world filled with defenseless victims and never-ending justice. In this low-rent tale, Tommy Lee Jones plays a useless, impotent, befuddled old sheriff. In real life, he is an amazingly talented actor who needs to fire his agent.--Spike Walker-Oregon USA"
fciocca,"Jun 27, 2021",10/10,"""No Country for Old Men"" is one of those rare movies for which I do not have any remark. The buildup and the tension that the Cohen brothers managed to craft is amazing and the film keeps you constantly on the verge. You always wonder which is the next move of Chigurh, which is the strategy of Moss to avoid getting killed. All the events are so well connected and especially believable. Nothing feels forced or out of the place.Characters are amazing. Anton is cold and ingenious. He is extremely calm, while he performs his hits, a perfect psychopath, that really scared me for his behavior. Javier Bardem gave an excellent performance and this role just fit him like a glove. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sheriff of a small town, where basically nothing really bad happens, and despite his skills, he decides to avoid the main investigation because he does not want any kind of responsability or pressure. His acting is just on point, as he speaks with the accent of the county. The whole cast is composed by grade A actors such as Woody Herrelson or Josh Brolin. They have completely nailed it.After more than 10 years, this product is still one of the most beautiful crime stories: the script is extremely solid, I never felt bored or annoyed by some scenes or characters. This is how a film should be made, if you want to keep your audience invested. I definitely recommend watching it. Beware though: there are tons of violent and explicit scenes."
Xarx117,"May 20, 2022",9/10,"This is the Cohen brothers Masterpiece and its an underrated movie. The dialog is extremely good. The quotes are funny, scarry and deep in meaning. The movie is what i could say raw, by the sense that there is hardly any music or emotions but you can tell those emotions if you look close enough in the actors faces. This is probably one of the main reason why some people dont like it, but if i can say to those people a word, i would say stop watching and try to understand the bigger meaning. The way the scenes transit to each other is very special. They cut a scene leaving you to ask questions but they don't answer them. Its a good example that we don't need to know everything in a movie for it to be good. Everything in this movie has hardly never been done anywhere else before. The acting performance is also stunning. The ending powerfully portays how life is not fair and how we should not expect it to be. This is one of the best message transmited trough script in history of films. This is surely one of the best movie script ever written."
l_rawjalaurence,"Nov 9, 2013",9/10,"Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be. Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air. The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme. One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available""). The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous. The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances. By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued. Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time. It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties. A true modern classic."
zewacki,"Mar 15, 2012",10/10,"OK simply a great film. The reason is it's deep metaphorical meaning in tone and atmosphere. I must warn people who view this film that you might have mixed feelings. The reason is simple. It's a complex movie. If you want to see a movie for just entertainment value then you are in the wrong place. It is entertaining to a point, but it's best to have an open mind. It is simply a metaphorical and symbolic film. It is a movie about strength. It reflects on audience's own strengths if they have it. It is violent and haunting. For people with a weak stomach please don't see this picture. If you have a closed mind please don't see this picture. If you don't want to challenge yourself please don't see this picture. You are warned."
SafReviews,"Oct 2, 2020",6/10,"For me, the beginning and the ending prevented the movie being from being a good and thrilling movie. The first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie was slow which I didn't mind to be honest because the movie started to get more intriguing and I started to understand and follow the plot a bit more. So the movie was good until towards the last 30 or so minutes where it was anticlimactic because they didn't show the big final action scene like the vast majority of other movies do. I understand they was trying to be different from the other movies, but the ending just didn't give me a satisfying and intrigued feeling which movie endings should do. Positives of the movie are that I thought the action scenes were good and I liked the character Anton Chigurh because I thought he was very portrayed well."
jubilee77,"Mar 23, 2010",9/10,"Despite its many good reviews from the press, this Coen Bros masterpiece is bound to have some criticism from ordinary members of the public once they have seen it and they don't fully understand what's it all about. Set mostly in Texas around the 1980s, this film contains what is considered to be brutal and with gruesome violence for the reason why it sometimes has its criticisms and some saying that Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff ET Bell wasn't doing anything to tackle it with the real killer getting away with it only just. Well, others would consider saying that he wisely chooses to distance himself and not to risk it because what's the point when it comes to dealing with a vicious triangle of dodgy drug gangs as it would be difficult to tackle it alone. Even so, there are also some ""ordinary"" people whom were also being killed and that's mainly because some of these civilians ""choosed a path"" what's the point in getting involved in a life of crime and with these criminal activities and what's the risk. On the other hand, I would still think this film to be a masterpiece from the Coen Brothers and its well made and I would recommend it only to those whom would have a better understanding on what's it all about."
Jawsphobia,"Jan 5, 2008",N/A,"Marred only by the fashionably nihilistic stated theme, the movie is fun to watch when it has momentum and also tense when it wants to be. But a grandmother character sticks out like a broken bone among an otherwise great cast as indirect as the screenplay tries to be with exposition it sounds ham-fisted in its attempts to prove the crazy hit-man baddie's world view correct. It will be called a ""smart man's thriller"" but it still has moments where the audience may be brighter than the protagonist and a tracking device premise that we have already seen easily defeated in The Da Vinci Code. So much for playing superior, Coens. The movie is at its best in silent stretches, though tolerable when reflective. Based on a novel or not, for me it is the movie where Two-Face/Harvey Dent Tommy Lee Jones from Batman Forever is trying to track down a baddie who has the same quirk of coin-flipping to determine one's fate. It occurs to me that we give a bad guy more slack; he can be a superhuman Rambo figure sewing himself up and evading the worst you can dish out as long as he makes matters worse. It's not pandering to wish fulfillment fantasies, unless your wish is to steer clear of happy endings. Is there any such thing as a spoiler if the ending is a downer? I say no, but I've left out the details just in case."
karsedate_m,"Jan 2, 2015",9/10,"""A new reflection of modern society"" The remained dark sense of humor by the Coen brother that were put in any of their movies. The No Country for Old men's humor still remain Coen brother's style, with the perspective of suffocation, dark, ""Horrible but true"". The uniquely of this western movie style is incredible. We can see that the protagonist is not the typical ""Hero beat bad guys"" kind of thing but instead is the worn out sheriff. Even on one scene he mention that He can't win, he's too exhausted. During the movie, I should warn you. You might fell asleep from all the quiet, slow pace of the story but those can be easily ignored by excellent aggressive acting of ""Javier Bardem"" (Anton) the antagonist and ""Tommy Lee Jones"" the sheriff protagonist having to chase after Anton. This movie can be view in many perspective. Many society symbolism, but what? See it for your self."
danielvchambers,"Jun 28, 2024",10/10,"One of the most impressive films I've ever seen. Story sucks you right in and you genuinely start feeling for the characters. A must see film in my book with interesting plot twists. In my view a very strong performance by all actors. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin are absolutely excellent. I'm by no means an expert critic, but I haven't seen Brolins name in the award nominees. He deserves being recognised. Javier Bardem plays an ice cold killer..almost scary...so strong. Well deserved Oscar win, but more actors could've been nominated. The setting in the 80s Texas makes it perfect. Dialogues are superb. Must see!"
Wasp-12-21-11,"Jan 31, 2012",8/10,"The second cinematic outing from directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen, No Country For Old Men is a finely polished, ultra-violent Western-thriller that, despite a slow- burning pace full of extended monologues and seemingly random interludes, rewards patient viewers with edge-of- your-seat thrills, stunning cinematography and top-class acting, especially from Javier Bardem as the ruthless sociopathic hit-man, whose very presence in each scene will scare the living daylights out of each viewer. The underrated Josh Brolin is impressive as the Vietnam veteran who stumbles across a drug deal gone murderously wrong, while Tommy Lee Jones is exceptional as the policeman who overviews the case in its bloody entirety. Maybe not worthy of all the awards it received (particularly Best Picture/Director), but an intoxicating affair overall."
raphaklopper,"Apr 15, 2013",10/10,"""When a rat eats the cheese, he gets fat, with that he becomes a prey to the cat because the cat loves the rat's fatness and starts chasing him insanely, during this chase the old dog sees the situation and starts chasing the cat because it is his great rival, and somehow help the mouse because he has nothing against him, making a kind of justice. That's ""No Country for Old Men "", with humans and a nowadays western, and arguably the best work of Joel and Ethan Coen .... the Coens! The story begins when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a former Vietnam veteran finds a briefcase with $ 2 million at a crime scene. Suddenly finds himself being hunted by the pure evil that is the character Anton Chigurh (Javier Barden) a violent persecution from Texas to the Mexican border. And behind them, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in search of Anton and somehow protect Llewelyn. Most intriguing in this persecution is that the three characters never interact, just chase between them, which increases every second.The Coen once again surpassed themselves, not only were super loyal Cormac McCarthy's novel, but took your stuff to a new level. ""No Country"" has a dark tone and a really scary cat-and-rat persecution through the vast modern western that brings many kills and whiles much suspense. The three characters never interact in the film; one is always one step after another, getting much more electrifying and frightening.But even with the dark tone, the Coens have managed to make the film strangely fun, the little black humor of the Coens (even in small amounts) is present here. Not only is the tiny humor that make's the movie really fun to watch, but is full of intriguing dialogs and very interesting to listen to, the Coens have never been good at writing on his films. But not only is the partnership of the two brothers in the screenplay that stands out but also the direction. The film manages to have action sequences filmed in a greater perfection and style, the two Coens working behind the camera is delightful to watch.The cast also not left behind, both Tommy and Josh are perfect in their roles, but Javier is fantastic in every detail, her character is so mean and cruel and at the same time, very intriguing. He is the wild cat whatever grease, money Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee's old dog who wants to do ""justice"".The Coen brothers were overcome by presenting a film written and performed in a fantastic way, a story full of suspense and a final electrifying message as in every movie of the Coens, while in ""Fargo"" it was about the lack of decency and respect for human beings , ""No Country for Old Men"" takes us back to the lack of honor that our society suffers today, and how respectful and honorable are our ancestors. A modern Western that manages to be the definitive masterpiece of Coen, totally recommended!"
Portis_Charles,"Dec 26, 2023",10/10,"One of those rare films that achieve absolute perfection. Fascinating and exciting, relentless. Everything is paced to the very exact second, an allegory of a fate that catches up with everyone and from which no one can escape. We all know that a single decision can change our lives forever and this film exposes this mechanism for all to see. We put ourselves completely in the shoes of the main character and we associate ourselves with his destiny and his mistakes. He faces a force of quasi-mythological power which is embodied in one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema, played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. The tragic violence of Cormac McCarthy and the deadpan style of the Coens blend into a miracle of balance, a manifesto for the immeasurable force of narrative cinema."
MegaGDestroyah,"Sep 24, 2024",6/10,"Not a bad movie or anything but i felt like it lacked lots of depth with a very simplistic story. The best part of the movie easily is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, who delivers an extremely good performance. Actually, this movie is very well made, well written (dialogue wise), and well acted. But I honestly though the plot was just too simple. Characters aren't really fleshed out that well, and even though they're likable, they're not very deep. I guess its meant to be a simple story, but in this case i think it works to the film's detriment. Aside from the entertaining murders and chase scenes, the film doesn't have much to offer. It made it hard for me to be immersed in the film or grasp the stakes because there just isn't much there to grasp in the first place. I felt it more style over substance honestly. Very good style, but still almost no substance."
dazzlem,"Nov 9, 2007",7/10,"I'm a Coen Brother's fan and I went in with very high hopes. What with the people that matter calling this their best offering in years, some going so far as to call it their best ever. That's reason enough for me to shell out the $11.50. Something I do less and less these days. Do I think I got my money's worth? Yes and no. For the first hour and change I was treated to a first rate thriller with grand, Sam Shepard's America type themes, a lot like Blood Simple actually. And I, the eager film goer, became immersed, developed a fondness and then considerable concern for the guy I took to be the protagonist. Then with less that a half hour to go, they did the darndest thing. They dipped out of my hero's story, at the climax of all places..in an edit that looked and felt like a bad projectionist had just changed reels. It was, as I've read here and elsewhere, a move in keeping with the style of the novel. The choice to tell the story in this way was apparently one of those form equals theme moves like Beckett's Waiting For Godot. I spent the better part of an hour chewing it over with my girlfriend. We're not the sharpest knives in the drawer for sure, so maybe a second viewing will give me something more to hold on to."

featherstone-758-470869,"Feb 19, 2011",9/10,"This film is terrifying, quite possibly one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen. Now don't read that first sentence and stop reading, the film is terrifying yes, but also terrifyingly brilliant. I would go as far to argue that it is the best psychological thriller I have ever sat through, it just had all the right ingredients and equally was missing all the crucial bits.Sometimes its important to praise something for what its missing, not just what its got in abundance. A good psychological thriller is meant to leave the audience asking questions, to allow them to draw their own conclusions on aspects of the plot which are frankly, not crucial. So yes this film did have plot holes, however I feel every one of them was deliberate. Mainly because it encourages you to ask questions, challenge theories and ultimately be psychologically tested.Additionally, this film lacks a score, with virtually no music whatsoever: adding to the terror of this film. It creates an atmosphere which doesn't just stay on the screen, but oozes into your front room and grips you around the throat. The camera work, the pace, and most of all the assailant.Bardem's character is clearly what makes this movie. The aura surrounding this psychopathic murder is so intense that you feel yourself tensing up every time he comes into view, yet you are so intensely fixated by his ruthless, emotionless manor so that you don't turn away. Even from the very first shot of this masterpiece creation, you are immediately made to feel uncomfortable. The shocking realism of this cinematic creation is blood-curdling. Even if the rest of this film was terrible, I would probably praise it just as much for the creation of such a villain.Luckily, its not. Brolin and Jones clearly are due some praise, both delivering solid performances. All three performances offer contrasts in pace, technique and screenplay skill, culminating in a memorable masterpiece worthy of praise for a long while yet.Basically just watch this, you will not know just how terrifyingly brilliant this film is until you feel your mind racing afterwards.92/100"
m_shankar20,"Feb 18, 2008",6/10,"The film starts like a thriller. We meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who seems to be killing for fun. Then we meet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds a bag full of dollars. And then, Anton is chasing Moss. The film moves like a thriller. But unfortunately, it does not end like one.There is no history or reason to Bardem's character. He is pure evil. He is invincible. On the contrary, Brolin's character is real and vulnerable. This difference in their characters lends a demon-vs-human kind of feel to the story. But the second half of the film disappoints. Chigurh's chase and Moss' accidental fortune both end in nothing. Then there is Tommy Lee Jones character which I found added nothing to the storyline, other than dollops of philosophical musings.Javier Bardem packs in a powerhouse performance. The cinematography is fantastic. Coen brothers do create an interesting character in Chigurh. But all that are achievements in isolation. I failed to understand what the story was about. It would have been an interesting thriller with a more simpler and straight forward climax."
Red_Identity,"Oct 2, 2009",N/A,"No Country For Old Men was deserving of all the praise and awards it got back in 2007. While I did root for other films of that year to win Best Picture, like Atonement or There Will Be Blood, with a repeat viewing of NCFOM, this is just under those films, if not right on par with them. The screenplay is very meaningful and thought-provoking as it is tense and thrilling. This is a Western thriller, a subtle but very absorbing film. The lack of a soundtrack really adds to the film's tension, and we are more concentrated on all of the little things that happen. The Coen brothers have only made one other film in the past that had really surprised me, and that was Fargo. While I still am not sure which is better, I think both are Masterpieces and deserve to be classics for years to come.The performances in the film are strong. Most notably, Javier Bardem. His performance won him an Oscar, and very deserved. He gives a creepy and subtly controlled performance, and makes a villain like no other since Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (and since then, Heath Ledger has also joined that list). Kelly Macdonald and Tommy Lee Jones were also pretty amazing, the former giving one of my favorite supporting female performances of 2007. Josh Brolin is strong, but his role requires less of a big acting challenge than Jones or even Macdonald I would think. Woody Harrelson was great in his small screen time, and he made the best of it. The cinematography is perfect, as you would think from the guy who also shot the amazingly beautiful The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.What I also love about this film is that simple meaning of violence in this country. The film's opening monologue by Jones, and his closing scene proves that this really was his story, and also the reason for the unresolved plots. While I was one of the few that was frustrated by the final scene in the film, I can truly appreciate it now. No Country For Old Men is a great film, powerful and absorbing!"
MichaelMargetis,"Nov 23, 2007",10/10,"Anton Chigurh: What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss.Goddamn! The Coen Brothers are back and in full form. It seems as though 'No Country For Old Men' is the film to beat this year for the coveted Best Picture Oscar prize. Although it was a different film than I expected, it's every bit as powerful, tense, awkwardly funny and relevant as I had hoped, perhaps even more so. Based on Cormac McCarthy's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, 'No Country For Old Men' is a deeply symbolic and straight-forward story of the struggle between good and evil. The film opens with a flawlessly delivered monologue by the ever-so-great Tommy Lee Jones who portrays Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Bell is a small-town sheriff in the state of Texas, and in his monologue he talks about how hardened and ruthless we've become as a society. ""The crimes we see today...it's hard to even take it's measure. It's just all out war."" mutters Bell. This monologue is the perfect setting for Llewyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who while hunting antelope in the desert stumbles upon half a dozen dead Mexicans, heroin and $2.4 Million. Being the road scholar he is, Moss figures no one will come looking for the moo-la if he snatches it. WRONG! Not only does the Mexican mafia and reputable bounty hunter / smart-ass Carson Welles (Woody Harrelson) pursue Moss, but also one of the most twisted, unpredictable and unreasonable villains in recent film history. His name is Anton Chirguh (Javier Bardem), and when he's not blowing innocent civilians' heads off with a cattle gun or flipping a coin to determine whether you live or die, he quietly observes everybody and everything around him.'No Country For Old Men' is a triumph in film-making in that the film has no real flaws. Critics might pan it as ""slow-moving"" but that's essential in order to correctly build the tension for the key scenes. Most of the film is actually quite fast-paced with such nerve-wracking sequences it will have you on the edge of your seat with a knot in your stomach for a majority of it's runtime. But 'No Country's' quiet and subtle scenes are every bit as powerful as it's action-packed and suspenseful ones. This is due in large part to the screenplay. Supposedly following very closely to McCormac's novel, the Coen brothers deliver their finest work EVER from a screen writing perspective. Yes, it's even better than 'Fargo'. As for the Coen's directing and editing, it has never been smoother. The film's transitions are nothing short of breathtaking.From an acting stand-point 'No Country For Old Men' is also incredible. The stand-out of the film is of course Javier Bardem as the ruthless homicidal maniac Chirguh. Just his facial expressions and body language is enough to make your skin crawl, and if that's not enough, he delivers every line including his catch-phrase ""friend-O"" with such brooding intensity and creepiness it makes you want to sink in your seat. Bardem is a lock for a Best Supporting Actor nomination this Oscar season, but his biggest competition is the two other key performances of the film. Josh Brolin who last week impressed me with his malicious turn in 'American Gangster' as a crooked cop, is the best he's ever been here in the role of Moss. Moss is such an unlikely hero in the sense he is kind of dumb, not very nice, makes stupid decisions and yet we still root for him to escape the drudges of the Mexican mafia and even worse, the wrath of Chirguh. Tommy Lee Jones I'd say is Bardem's biggest competition. With this and 'In the Valley of Elah', Jones has proved this year with these two performances that if anything he's getting better with age. Jones' monologues are flawlessly delivered like I previously stated, including his final one which left me with goose bumps at the end of the picture. Woody Harrelson is humorous in his limited role as a sharp-witted and over-confident bounty hunter, and Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald is phenomenal in her role as Moss' butter-brain wife. The film has a numerous amount of strong small performances including Garret Dillahunt as Bell's Deputy, Tess Harper as Bell's wife and the 'Office Space' stapler guy (Stephen Root), in a well-played dramatic role as a crime boss. Roger Deakins outdoes himself yet again with some awesome cinematography, and while quiet and subtle, the film's music score is haunting.There is no other film this year that I can recommend as highly as 'No Country For Old Men'. There are times when it has you on the edge of your seat in suspense, there are times when it has you laughing violently at some of the darkly humorous scenes and through-out the entire 121 minutes it has you using your brain. There's a lot of symbolism and powerful metaphors in the film, but since I'm not writing a 5-page essay, I'll let you figure them out for yourself. With 'No Country For Old Men' the Coen Brothers have once again raised the bar on how outstanding and thought-provoking a simple crime-drama can be. Grade: A"
Momcat_of_Lomita,"Jul 23, 2011",N/A,"I loved this movie. But this is not a movie for everyone, I want to be very clear about that. It is violent, it is scary, and it doesn't end with the bad guys losing and the good guys heading off to a ""happily ever after."" If you're looking for a harmless popcorn movie with comic-book violence that's so exaggerated it's unreal and a feel-good ending, be warned: ""No Country for Old Men"" is not what you're looking for.There's also no romance here, so forget it as a ""date movie;"" and while there's a certain amount of irony to it, there really isn't any humor.Which leaves: a suspenseful plot in the chase/hunt genre, some really superb acting, and everything put together in a movie that just won't quit.Plot basics: Llewelyn ""Lew"" Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a hapless regular good ol' boy in the desert southwest country, lucks into $1,000,000 in cash when he stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. He doesn't know that the guys the money belongs to tucked away a transponder in the middle of one of the bundles of cash, and that he can be located by someone who has the receiver tuned to the proper frequency who knows roughly where he may have gone.Lew and his wife Carla Jean abandon their trailer home; Carla Jean heads off to her mother's, and Lew heads off to try to figure out how to hide the loot.It's Lew's bad luck that one of the parties to the drug deal has hired Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an executioner that's as relentless as Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"" android and is pure sociopathic killer.Chigurh (pronounced like ""sugar"") has to join the movie bad guy Hall of Fame. He simply doesn't care who he has to kill to get a job done, and when he decides he has to kill someone, he isn't going to change his mind. (This figures very prominently in the way the end of the movie plays out.) Once he knows that Lew is who he is hunting, the chase is on.Chigurh isn't just the hunter in this film; he's hunted by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the lawman in whose jurisdiction the drug deal gone bad went down. Bell quickly realizes what's going on, and unlike Lew and Carla Jean, he realizes how deadly serious the situation is. Lew knows he's being hunted, but he doesn't know how deadly the guy hunting him is; he also has a cocky belief that he's smart enough to shake off the pursuit and hang onto the cash.Bell tries to communicate with Lew through Carla Jean; he tries to get across to Carla Jean that Lew's life is in danger. Carla Jean is rattled, but she can't convince herself that shopping her husband to the law is the lesser of the evils.The hunt is on. And that's basically what the rest of the movie consists of: Lew trying to escape with the money, Chigurh (and ultimately several other parties to the drug deal) trying to hunt Lew down, and Sheriff Bell trying to get to Lew in time to save him.There's a lot of collateral damage in this hunt, and it's the way Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell is affected by the carnage that raises this movie above the level of your average hunter-and-hunted movie. Bell realizes that what he's dealing with in Chigurh, and to some extent the people who employ Chigurh, is something so far beyond the average kind of criminal he's used to dealing with that he literally cannot win. Chigurh is without any compunction: if the way to get to Lew involves killing people who are totally innocent, but whose deaths make it easier for him to get to Lew, then those people are going to die. And unlike the sheriff, who wastes time and effort in feeling something for the victims (even those who aren't completely innocent), Chigurh just mentally closes the books and moves on, the dead forgotten.Sheriff Bell realizes that however good he is at what he does, however well he does his job, he can't stop someone like Chigurh, he can't win the fight. Maybe nobody can, but for sure he can't and so it's time to step down and let someone else try.This is an excellent movie, but it doesn't spare anyone and it doesn't finish in a way that leaves you feeling good. It's unrelenting in following the story through to the bitter end. Literally the bitter end.Bardem and Jones are unforgettable; Woody Harrelson does a fine turn; Kelly Macdonald is sympathetic and completely believable as the wife who is content to let her husband make the choices for both of them...until it's too late.""No Country for Old Men"" is an excellent choice for an intense, powerful, suspenseful movie with some top-rate performances in it. But definitely not for light entertainment or easy viewing, or for people who want a happy ending."

Wow this movie is a present! The beginning.... Nobody talks for the first 10-15 minutes or so. Just fantastic acting and camerawork...

Screen_Blitz,"Jun 25, 2017",10/10,"Life in west is violent, at least that is what many cinematic entries in the western genre lead you to believe. Hollywood moguls Joel and Ethan Coen take on the audacious of taking the pages of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and spinning it into cinematic proportions. It is significantly difficult feat to pull as McCarthy's sophisticated style of writing have lead many to believe translating his works into films are far too easier said than done. In spite of this, it appears that no one's directing methodology is a suitable match of McCarthy's writing other than the Coen Brothers. In a splendid effort, the masterminds behind such projects as 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their debut 'Blood Simple' bring McCarthy's western tale to life in an pure enthralling fashion. It is violent, gory, and unquestionably dark in tone. But beneath the surface is immersive talent of the Coen Brothers who more than effectively uproot a tale of fate, conscious, and perplexing morality. Set in 1980, this film follows Southern Texas native Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a retired Vietnam veteran who goes on a hunting trip only to come across a string of dead bodies in what appears to have been a drug deal gone awry. Upon investigating the gruesome scene, he gets a hold of a suitcase containing a few million dollars. While Llewelyn manages to run away with it in attempt to make it to the Texas border, a sadistic sociopath Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) sets out to retrieve it, leading to a series of grisly murders. Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) goes the run to investigate the increasing body count.If the violence and bloodshed don't serve as a detriment to sitting through this two-hour work of art, then you are in for beautiful ride. After all, it is the Coen Brothers behind the wheel of this cinematic endeavor. Continuing on their signature methodology of mixing violence with darky, wry humor and eccentric characters, the Coens bring a masterful sleight of hand in operating the story of a bloody cat-and-mouse game where the fate of each character is unpredictable. The biggest show stealer here is Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, a nihilistic, violence-hungry mastermind who becomes the driving force behind the briskly paced plot. He is a man with a complex sense of morality and shows little to no mercy on anyone who crosses his path. Each second he shows up on screen, things get very suspenseful within the blink of an eye. Coming face-to-face with each individual, Chigurh has a questionable of determining their fate, and that is flipping a corn and ordering them to guess it. If the Coens prove anything, one of them is that sometimes silence can be more nerve-racking than the presence of suspenseful music. And the best part is that the film does not need an eerie music score to portray its suspense. The dialogue and Bardem's unforgettable delivery firmly gets the job done. If you find yourself laughing, the chances are it is an uncomfortable one. (And let's not forget Roger Deakins's admirable camera-work put into the mix) As for Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, both manage to give some decent performances, the latter of whom adds a sense of dark humor to the atmosphere with his sharp dialogue. Woody Harrellson plays a small role and does a fine job, but his time on screen is rather short. Kelly MacDonald, a Scottish actress showing off with her nifty Southern accent, gives a nice portrayal as the lead character's wife. Again not too much screen time.No Country for Old Men is violent, yet masterfully crafted western thriller uprooted by the directorial talent of the Coen Brothers. It is an astounding cinematic gem that proves why the Coens are such a respected filmmaking duo. At best, it stands in the front ranks of cinematic entries of the modern western genre. As for Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones; these three deserve a round of applause."
rayesh_g,"Aug 15, 2009",10/10,"""No country for old men"" is one of the best thrillers that I've seen in years. This is the first movie of the Coen brothers that I came upon and there's no doubt that I'll reach out for more. Their innovative writing and masterful story telling techniques has made quite an impression on me to check out their much earlier films.The story follows a poor farmer (played wonderfully by Josh Brolin) who came across a suitcase of money in a drug deal gone wrong and his struggle to steer his life away from the villainous Anton Chigur. A man with a terrifying smile, who travels across Texas, carrying a cattle gun, destroying anything that would cause him any inconvenience when it comes to acquiring the briefcase. It is hard to even imagine such a man could exist, but then again its not. This may sound as quite a simple story but then again the great masters such as Ozu and Bresson used simple stories to create innovative work. It is through their simplicity that they evoked such powerful emotions in the characters as well as in the audience. Here the Coen brothers follow the same route. It is flawlessly shot to the point that it's suspense would without a doubt hold you at the edge of the seat. The photography of the stark beautiful western landscape and creative writing are two more aspects of the film that deserves much admiration."
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Jul 7, 2008",10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLlewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across some dead Mexicans, a huge stash of heroin and a load of cash. He gives in to temptation, and takes the cash, vaguely aware there may be some payback for it. He finds himself being pursued by the psychotic Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who leaves a trail of blood and destruction behind him. On both their trails is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy. On the verge of retirement, Bell really is starting to lose his faith with people and the world.Although they're regarded as gold by film lovers in general, I can only remember one film of the Coens I thought was great, and that was the snow drenched Fargo. I'm sure there are many others, I've just not bothered to see them, but I have just seen this new one that makes me further of the persuasion that maybe I should see some more of their older ones. The brothers have crafted a film based around atmosphere, mood and tension, where such little things as a sweet wrapper unfolding, a tracking device beeping or a telephone ringing are given new dimensions. Some, less refined, viewers might find the film 'boring' but quite simply they don't know enough about film or what makes it an art form.Getting the style and substance of the film so right, the Coens are also treated to some brilliant performances. Bardem (could have fooled me, I thought he was Robert Downey Jr.???) is the star of the show, as a genuinely scary and unpleasant guy, who takes no nonsense, leaves bloodbaths not bodies and even has to creep people out when he's apparently just joking with them. Jones also shines as the world weary cop, who really does feel like he's about to lose his faith in human will and nature. Rising star Brolin is sadly left to basque in their greatness, alongside supporting stars Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald.Not one for those with the attention span of a knat, then, but for those who truly appreciate films and what makes them an art form, this is highly recommended. *****"
Monotreme02,"Jan 4, 2008",10/10,"The film represents a downright uncanny application of cinematic craft on the Coen's part. They deliver storytelling in its most flawless, raw, visceral form, and indeed the film has quite the incredible story to tell, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I have intentionally put off reading in order to enjoy the film to the fullest, although I fully intend to seek it out now  by the way, if anybody hasn't read McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel ""The Road"", do so now). But the Coens have long before transcended telling a mere plot. The film provides its best storytelling when there is no dialogue. Notice with what utter grace and absolute perfection the Coens create tension and drama. From the first moment he appears on screen, we are scared petrified of the Anton Chigurh character, and the Coens have calculated the introduction of his appearance and mannerisms so that every time he merely walks onto the screen, we get chills down our spine. Behold probably the most amazingly directed sequence of any film this year, which involves Llewelyn Moss sitting in his motel room and hearing what are clearly Chigurh's footsteps coming down the hall, until his shadow appears under the crack of the door. But if only that were all  Chigurh continues to turn off the light, drenching the scene in pitch-darkness. No other scene in any other film this year has more effortlessly created tension and true, primal fear within me as a viewer. And the scene continues, as Llewelyn apprehends a vehicle, immediately after which the windshield begins to shatter from Chigurh's shots that are being fired from who knows where, which further elevates the pressure. One of the scariest scenes in any film this year cannot be found in The Mist, or in 1408, or in any of the shock-horror pictures put out, but rather can be found right near the beginning of No Country, as the Chigurh character enters a small gas station shop and manages, without doing much at all besides playing an almost-too-calm word game with the teller, to obstinately petrify and terrorize us. I don't think a screen character has ever been depicted as more nervous than that of the store clerk in the scene in question. It is precisely these characters, such as that of the store clerk or the overweight landlady at the trailer park, that make this film so unmistakably Coen. Their mannerisms and way of talking, while not meant to be comic, are presented in an almost comic fashion. It is that unique Coen sense of humour, in which they turn the nerve-racking edginess and anxiety in the gas station scene with Chigurh into a comic moment. The Coens have an uncanny ability to create comedy simply out of the absurdity of the situation. Not a word is wasted, and every strand of dialogue, every line and passage, is absolutely and entirely pitch-perfect; it is an incredible, extraordinary screenplay.The Coens had previously reached a creative peak with Fargo, but No Country for Old Men serves as a new high for the directorial duo, and if Michelangelo can have both the Sistine Chapel and his statue of David, then surely the Coens are entitled to their two masterpieces; the classic Fargo and the modern No Country. The pieces can be further viewed as companions due to their striking similarities in terms of themes, setting and visuals; both featuring stark, horizon-reaching landscapes, regular-guy characters who get mixed up with the very wrong people, and police officers as the moral cores of the film and ultimately the central subject matter. But if Fargo delivered a more uplifting moral closure with the story of Marge Gunderson, No Country for Old Men is far more pessimistic, delivering a scathing life lesson in the depressing closure to Ed Tom Bell's tale. As in all of their films, No Country also features that very specifically Coen brothers sense of humour, which can turn even a dark and menacing dramatic thriller into a comedy by playing off the ridiculousness of the characters and the situations they get themselves into. The film also serves as a stunning, remarkable application of cinematic craft, featuring absolutely stupefying direction, cinematography, editing, production value and everything in between. Working from an utterly brilliant screenplay from the Coens, the actors deliver unnerving, compelling, show-stealing performances, in particular Tommy Lee Jones as the scarred old timer for whom this violent country is certainly no place; Josh Brolin in a brilliant lead-role debut as the naive average Joe who gets mixed in way over his head with unstoppable forces of nature; and Javier Bardem, as the ruthless, terrifying, primeval villain and embodiment of pure evil. It is a striking, epic, complex, many-leveled work of seething bleakness and stunning desolation, delivering an all-around depressing moral and human outcome. It is a movie that lives and breathes through its fascinating characters, its visceral settings, its striking visuals. It is the best film of the year, and an astounding, incredible cinematic achievement on all possible planes. The Coens have truly outdone themselves and have finally sealed their spot as one of if not the most important modern-day cinematic auteurs. May we see only work like this from them in the future  a masterpiece if I've ever seen one."
rullstolsnisse-95459,"Jul 6, 2020",8/10,"This movie displays a methodical but also spontaneous psychopath played flawlessly by Javier bardem. For me, this movie has small crumbs of humor to pick up, but it's a very dark and powerful story about a man fulfilling an intense journey. This is a classic, and if you haven't seen it it's a must watch!This is also the best movie Javier has every made in my opinion."
dtb,"Jan 26, 2008",10/10,"The Coen Brothers turn back to crime in their stark, stunning, justifiably Oscar-nominated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (NCfOM). There's a Sam Peckinpah feel to this gripping 1980-set thriller. It's a morality play and a tense suspense story rolled into one  the leaner, meaner, more vicious brother of the Coens' previous great thrillers BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO.NCfOM's protagonist is Vietnam vet Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin in a brooding, laconic, star-making performance), who goes hunting near the Rio Grande and finds himself embroiled in nightmarish mayhem and violence, Texas prairie style. Instead of bagging wild game, Llewellyn bags $2 million in drug money after stumbling across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, complete with corpses, even a dead dog. (It's chilling to see the bodies in the process of decaying as others happen upon the scene over the course of the movie.) Llewellyn thinks he can just take off with the money, dodge whoever might come after it, and live happily ever after with his sweet wife Carla Jean (played with a letter-perfect Texas accent by winsome Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Brolin and Macdonald make a wryly endearing couple. The rare times Llewellyn smiles, it's usually when he's talking with Carla Jean). To his peril, Llewellyn doesn't figure on being pursued by the likes of murderous bounty hunter Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a mysterious figure with a pneumatic cattle gun, a penchant for using a coin toss to decide whether someone should live or die, and a voice that sounds like it's coming not from a human being, but from the bowels of Hell itself. Chigurh relentlessly pursues the equally dogged Llewellyn through Texas as the compassionate, sad-eyed Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones as the film's voice of reason) tries to catch up, feeling overmatched by the sheer implacable evil of the ""ghost"" that is Chigurh.The film's pacing is deliberate, but for me that simply increased the suspense as I wondered what Chigurh would do next and if Llewellyn had a chance in hell of eluding him for good, especially with his ever-increasing number of injuries. The suspense scenes are real nail-biters. There's a thrilling chase with Llewellyn pursued at night, first by a monster truck, then into the rapids by dogs. Pit bulls don't stand a chance against bullets! :-) One of my favorite scenes finds Llewellyn in his motel room in the dark. The only lights are the glowing tracking transmitter he finds in the drug money and the light under the door from the hall outside -- until a pair of feet appear on the hall side. All we hear is the transmitter...and the sound of a light bulb in the hall being unscrewed, resulting in more darkness...and I can say no more!It's a tribute to the power of Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh that his unflattering Beatles moptop-cum-Prince Valiant pageboy haircut doesn't stop him from being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. It got so that every time Chigurh showed up, I'd watch the rest of the scene between the fingers covering my face, because I knew Bad Things Were About To Happen. Bardem's Chigurh is all the scarier because he can seem utterly calm and casual even as he blows people's brains out with that pneumatic cattle gun of his. The thing can blow out locks as well as brains, so its versatility makes up for its cumbersomeness. :-) As good as all of this year's Best Supporting Actor nominees are, I'm rooting hardest for Bardem to win the Oscar.There's some humor in the dialogue (taken mostly from the novel), but it's of the low-key, matter-of-fact variety. My favorite is the exchange between the deputy and Sheriff Bell: ""It's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?"" ""If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here."" My favorite black-humored sight gag: after Chigurh launches a protracted attack in which a cop is killed, the camera pulls back to show that the floor is completely covered with scuff marks from the dead man's shoes flailing and scraping against the floor during the struggle.Be warned, NCfOM is not for the squeamish or for those who like their endings neat and tidy, with everyone getting what they deserve. Nevertheless, it still haunts me, to the point where I happily paid to see it in a theater for a second time (with relatives who were as blown away by it as I was). Could NCfOM end up being the bloodiest, most suspenseful Best Picture Oscar winner since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? I feel that NCfOM is not only one of the best films of 2007, but one of the best films the Coens have ever made, richly deserving its 8 Oscar nominations. It's still playing in theaters as of this writing, so by all means, get out of the house and into a theater to see it for yourself!"
dianewds,"Dec 31, 2007",10/10,"2007 was a good year and offers many excellent films; domestic and international but among them all, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is perhaps the best of the best. (Yes, I have seen THERE WILL BE BLOOD and loved it but due to this film having 10s in all categories, think it best).Others have already commented in great detail about the storyline so will not address other than to say it was stellar and delivered some of the most memorable one-liners of a single movie that I can easily recall. Though I will say for those who had a problem with the ending, consider seeing it again.QUESTIONABLE ENDING: The ending was brilliant. We all want to think good guys will triumph and we'll finally know more about the sociopath killers and there will be an end will be in sight but (regrettably) the older we get, the more we come to realize there is likely not going to be an end to maniacal killings, not back when, now or in the future. ""Whatever is coming is coming"" as the old man says later in the movie. It is a ghost that continues to appear time and time again despite modern technology or know how. Though we've grown accustomed to our Westerns showing the good guys winning we see a realistic, mature and modern Western through the eyes of realism an older experienced lawman who now perhaps recognizes in a dream that a father is preparing the way for him. Think about it. Coen Brothers are brilliant.SANS MUSIC: No music risky? Yes and oh what a good choice. The screenwriter is so gifted; that combined with impeccable direction, grade A actors,and camera/sound work makes the choice to forgo not only purposeful but actually intensifies the suspense.Too, one can argue that there was a natural chorus of background sounds, i.e. the wind rustling, car on gravel road, boots on pavement, gravel, the sounds that seem to echo loudly especially in tense moments. While music can be crucial to building dramatic tension it can also detract.From the very beginning we are purposefully placed, frame by frame, within the film along with the characters; we see and hear what they see and hear. Immediately we - through the passport of our senses, see and hear where we are - vast Texas country flatlands. Instead of a beautiful score to match the panoramic view we hear the beauty of a mature, older man's telling or overview of his experience and we begin to prepare ourselves for what ""might be coming"".We hear the sounds of that vastness of country road and see a cop placing a man (only a side-view of Bardem) in handcuffs in backseat of car, then in jail house seated behind him. The camera allows us to focus on conversation of the good-looking deputy in foreground and prisoner in the background with a first look at his face though not clearly the focal point. Then, within seconds we see his advancement, hear and see (from above) the look and sounds of a maniacal first and then second killing.Then shift to another countryside scene and are behind the gun focus of hunter, Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn, who is taking aim of a deer. All we hear and see is what he hears. Wind rustling, natural sounds. He's quiet and focused. We're quiet and focused and then, BANG! No music is needed, the action, the natural noise places us squarely where the director wants us, suspensefully riding shotgun throughout the entire movie. And, it works!CAST: Stellar cast. You know it's stellar when you can't make up your mind which star shines brightest. They all do. Perhaps one of my favs was the character with so little lines, Kelly MacDonald who plays Llewelyn's wife. First, she does a killer southern accent and second, her character is completely believable and you want to see her even more. Each times she's on screen is meaningful and memorable, especially the last scene.Brolin is also entirely believable as a Texan whose Nam experience (we learn latter) prepares him for absolutely any encounter. His performance deserves nomination for best actor category. The Texas mindset, dry wit, economy of words juxtaposed to swift and decisive actions have never delivered more authentically than they do in this screenplay. Brolin, Lee et-al get it and deliver.Javier Bardem in the opening scene tells us with no words, only his action and body movements what evil looks like. He is ruthless, calculating and crazed. He's the kind of character that engenders immediate fright and respect for his ""principles"" as Harrelson describes later. We learn all of this within ONE singular frame shot (from above) in the jail cell when he is strangling the deputy. It is that camera work and focus on Bardem's facial expression (no words and no music) that says it all. This is brilliant direction and acting perfection. He also deserves nomination for best actor and is phenomenal, period!Tommy Lee Jones delivers a perfect performance. I am always in awe of his ability to develop his character. He can take any role, lead or character, and make you wait with baited breath for his return to the screen. The sheriff is perhaps my favorite character in this movie. Again, the screenwriter really understands Texan mindsets and motivations. TLJones understands it and what he does with the lines and the silence in between the lines is what translates into a winning performance and movie.CREW: Camera (incredible),Sound (especially), sets, folio, editing, costumes, etc. all impeccable and a real blend of talent.See this movie and see it again. There's so much that makes it great. It's a winner now and will no doubt become a classic. Well done!"
vjnambu,"Feb 19, 2020",6/10,"No country for old men is watchable only for Javier bardem as a cold blooded serial killer who whenever appears on the screen sets a chill down your spine. Tommy Lee Jones has got limited screentime and josh brolin as usual keeps a straight face throughout. Movie is slow paced, lacks thrill, no entertainment and an unsatisfying climax. Even though evil triumphs, se7en's ending worked but not this one."
p_bohan,"Feb 9, 2008",9/10,"Too many comments have re-capped the generalities of the film - I'll cut to some of the potentially significant elements that are banging around in my melon (I'll be watching this film - like all my Coen brother flicks - again and again). -Why does Llewellyn hesitate in taking the antelope? -Why does the black limping dog running away from the remnants of the first shoot out scene look back? -The big gap in time from Llewellyn's death and his wife's execution... -The missing briefcase (money)- who actually GOT the dough? -What the hell happened to Anton? -Why does Anton sound SO much like the freak in 'Silence of the Lambs'? -Does Ed retire because he FOUND the briefcase hidden in the motel room? -The two dream interpretations - damn i need to see this picture again. Overall, this is a Coen Brother's masterpiece, i LOVED the picture for what it was - but it also stimulates the mind into looking beyond the superficial blood and guts. This one's a good-er. Go boys go."
abdulazizalsaad-73053,"Apr 12, 2021",7/10,"I don't get why people hate this movie so much, this movie in my opinion is a dialogue movie, for people who likes dialogues, I know that this movie has no point and going nowhere but as I said the point is it's dialogue, it's a cat and mouse movie but still a great one."
videorama-759-859391,"Feb 4, 2015",9/10,"This is a thoroughly entertaining movie you must put on your bucket list, with one of the most scariest performances from a great actor you'll ever see. The Coen Brothers have done it again with a great structured story. Although the plot is nothing new, it's the way this story is told, only enhanced by the great performance of Bardem as a psychotic contract killer, and I really mean psychotic. Escaping from police, he's after a suitcase of cash, in the wake of a drug buy that's gone wrong, out there in the country, that's left a score of guys dead. Unfortunately, but more unfortunate for Brolin, he's found the money and taken off with it, which again shows stolen moolah is blood moolah. This engrossing film from start to finish has it all, including some great comedy moments, one a trademark one, worth all it's amount in coin. There are some other great performances, notably, Tommy Lee Jones as a cynical and aging old sheriff. The scenes with him are gold, proving he's one of the greatest actors out there. Kelly Macdonald is really good as Brolin's nagging wife, who I must admit, I didn't realize at first. The ending is pretty grim, where seeing bones broken like in the Straw Dogs remake, makes me squirm a little. Too, for the viewer, nearing it's end, a ""Did he shoot her or not"" moment, which would of left a few movie goers ruminating, moments after seeing it. I believe the Coen brothers are incapable of making a bad movie, where to me, nothing they've done would score lower than an 8. This is one of those films, which I secretly refer to as movie candy. I could watch many times, and never be bored. Even the title is great, in a can't take your eyes off the screen movie. One criticism though was how Brolin was able to outrun that pick up truck of bad dudes, after he returned with that canteen of water, but hey all is forgiven. A must watch for everybody."
masonunitedcontrols,"Dec 18, 2021",9/10,"I just read a 1 star review of this film, wherein the righteous reviewer is telling us that this is an awful movie because ""it's too violent for their taste. That it depicts two guys that love money too much leaving dead bodies everywhere because of this greed. Folks like this just don't get it. They judge A MOVIE on its subject material itself, and the way it makes them feel, not on the quality of the way in which THE SUBJECT MATERIAL IS RENDERED AND PRESENTED. No one, and I mean no one, cares how a person feels about the subject material of any movie. It's at least irrelevant and at most glaringly ignorant to even mention it. It would be like Roger Ebert reviewing ""Jaws"" by saying, ""well this was just awful. All that blood and stuff. And I don't like the idea of men fishing for sharks!"" Ludicrous.But as for the quality of this movie, the way it grabs you and then holds you for 2 hours or whatever it is on the strength of the skill with which this movie is produced, Acting doesn't get better than Bardem and Brolin and Jones and the rest of this cast, and the directing, production quality, literally every single way in which one might judge a film, couldn't be any better. It's nearly perfection from the best of the best in filmmaking.The ending? Yeah that wasn't great. Gotta work on that. I get what happened but WHY and HOW did it happen was just glossed over and left to the reader totally. It was sort of a metaphysical copout.Still, this is one masterpiece of a film."
joncha,"Aug 23, 2020",6/10,"James Bond meets Texas Rednecks. There's this maniacal killer with a funny hair style and grim expression walking around with a gun and a tank of compressed air and either no one sees him or doesn't think to report his presence to the police. It never ceases to amaze me how quickly the local police in the Austin area where I live can come up with a suspect or make an arrest soon after a murder when there was no indication at first of who might have committed it. Yet in this movie the police are dumb or overcome with ennui or malaise that they can't capture or even track down someone who is so obviously on the loose and deadly. Especially after he killed the deputy early in the movie you'd think every cop in Texas would be on the lookout for him. So you just keep watching, wondering how dumber the people can be. And the kids: ""Hey, mister. Do you know you have a bone sticking out of your arm?"" I realize this story took place years ago before cell phones, but you'd think the kids would have thought to get someone to call for an ambulance."
the_dimbster,"Mar 14, 2022",10/10,"This movie is, by my experience, the best movie ever. That is to say, I connected to it in every facet. I love the quiet storytelling and how characters show their thinking with their actions. I love Sigur's low key menace, and how he just always feels dangerous. I very much enjoyed how the plot never quite does what you'd expect from a Hollywood movie, but still manages to be cooler than any action movie. I watched the Seventh Seal after this movie; I connected with this movie's metaphors so much more. I'm not sure if any art can be perfect, but I definitely wouldn't change a thing about this movie. That being said, I can understand how some might hate the third act, but I think the end made it more interesting. If you like a movie that you have to think about a bit at the end, then this is the ending for you!"
djurrepower,"Jan 16, 2020",7/10,"Nice hunter/hunted movie with some dialogue. i didnt get all of it, but im sure it has some meaning. characters were really well made and performed. so a nice realistic action movie with suspence and depth.7/10: itsa fine movie"
zippo8,"Jan 23, 2024",10/10,"People dissing this movie with the usual gripes are totally misunderstanding it, and in the process missing something much deeper than they seek.Its Bell s story as indicated by the title, it's about humanity losing its way from the old codes of fair play and decency to choas and randam acts of cruelty and greed for the sake of it. Where old men can no longer make sense of the world, it's a changing of the guard film, and prophetic too as the world has continued to devolve down that path with the loss of order, morals to live by, the old constructs and values.Those characters around Bell are incidental players created by novelist Cormac McCarthy to give this concept ""narrative life"". The Coens did it proud.Ive watched it many times. One of my faves. The conversations between Bell and Wendell are priceless."
Thecritichood234,"Dec 27, 2023",9/10,"This movie in my opinion is the definition of underrated simply put a story. That's kind of basic, but doesn't feel that way because the execution is delightful. First off the performances are really really top-notch especially Javier Bardem. He is such a psychopath. He is such a creature that you don't even want to look at or think about, Anton might possibly One of the best villains of all time, because he don't have to have no make up no superpowers no tape or anything the only thing that you see is this man's hair, because this man's hair does not fit him at all, but it feels right, because His character does not feel like he's a part of this earth, Josh Brolin put in a Very neat performance, and the same goes with Tommy Lee Jones and I love the fact that this movie does not have no soundtrack the only soundtrack is nature(wind). Each scene is tension after tension after tension because this film does not have no brakes each character especially Javier. Bardem character has a motive that's more relatable incense if you were a hitman, this is definitely a rewatch film to me because in my opinion, there's nothing wrong or no flaws in this movie except for some pacing issues but that's just for someone to nitpick Overall a masterpiece in my opinion, and something that filmmakers Directors and writer should learn from this film. This was a very neat movie. 9/10."
treadwaywrites,"Jan 7, 2009",8/10,"The winner of 2007 Best Picture from the Academy Awards. This marked the 4th consecutive year the Oscars would put a film from modern times in the winning position. This film was from Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax and Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Vantage. This was also the Coen Brothers' 12th film, the violent thriller-drama and contemporary western chase movie No Country for Old Men (with eight nominations, including four wins for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor), an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel about a hunter (Josh Brolin) who stole cash from a bad drug deal and then was relentlessly pursued. It was the Coen's first film based entirely on a novel.The Coen brothers always turn out a quality film even when sections of their films are hit and miss. For the most part the Coens have taken stories and moved in any direction that they wanted. This is the first film that has followed a novel where they were bound by the story. Every bit of this movie works and the mark of both Joel and Ethan are not lost. Even though the violence level is high, it is always to propel the story. Josh Brolin is excellent but the real talent here is the adaptation of the story in the screenplay and the direction. ****/****."
