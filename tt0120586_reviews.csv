xiaoli7377,"Jul 29, 2022",9/10,"I loved this movie, it's terrific. Edward Norton is great here, all the acting performances are good. A very important social message.I would have given it a 10 if it were longer. I wish there were more scenes of his thought process of leaving the skinhead movement, and more scenes of him bonding with his little brother (Edward Furlong) and slowly getting him to rework his worldview and frame of reference as well. The ending is also a little abrupt.I just wish for more of the film. Nothing wrong with what we got. It's already a phenomenal work of art that I implore every person of every race to watch. Obviously the subject matter is skinheads, but the theme of de-radicalizing your brain is universal and is much needed in today's world."
DanielStephens1988,"Oct 22, 2019",9/10,"The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil."
behbehseta,"Aug 6, 2019",10/10,"I give this movie a 10 because1) Edward Norton was the meaning of masterful acting, you could just look at his eyes and understand every little pain he felt and caused. His smile and manner switching before and after was so distinguishing that if you did not speak English you could just follow him.2) cinematography : not only the black and white phase was amazing some other shots was masterful3) the cause , I watched this movie in 2019 and it is as important and as relevant as it was 21 years ago"
jmchnwth,"Jan 7, 2006",10/10,"This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full."
exa56,"Jan 26, 2006",10/10,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!"
alexkolokotronis,"Feb 1, 2009",10/10,"American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jul 19, 2005",10/10,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
jerry_bear33,"Apr 2, 2000",N/A,"A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace and Love, JB33  Rating 5 stars"
kylopod,"Mar 13, 2006",7/10,"The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see ""American History X,"" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.It's an engrossing movie, nonetheless. It uses a device more common in literature than in the movies: inter-cutting between several story-lines. First we see Derek (Ed Norton) as a free man, newly released from prison, and having developed a conscience. Then we see earlier points in his life when he was a white supremacist, and finally the prison experience that changed him. The non-chronological approach is very effective, making the movie about as engaging as any thriller, even though the plot itself offers few surprises. Had the film followed a more conventional timeline, we'd have quickly grown impatient waiting for plot developments that were inevitable. With the way it's structured, our focus is on the process more than the outcome: How did a bright kid like Derek become a racist? And what turned him around?The movie takes great pains to show how articulate the younger Derek is when he justifies his hatred of blacks by citing the statistics of black crime. (His more personal motive is that blacks murdered his father.) His arguments hit upon common politically conservative themes as he finds fault with affirmative action, glorification of criminals like Rodney King, and liberals who blame (white) society for the problems facing blacks. But Derek takes this reasoning a step further and argues that blacks have a ""racial commitment to crime."" Of course, by taking that step, he undermines his own arguments. For example, how does his harping about ""personal responsibility"" square with his belief in judging people for factors beyond their control, like their race? Responsibility requires choice. If race were the reason for black crime, then black criminals would be morally blameless. But no character points out such contradictions in Derek's views. When he debates a liberal teacher played by Elliot Gould, the gentle Gould character acts like a milquetoast, unable to provide a strong rebuttal. It's a powerful scene, and more than plausible: as in real life, people aren't always prepared with eloquent answers, even when confronted by someone with indefensible views.Still, it's disconcerting that the film never fully addresses the ""intellectual"" side of his bigotry. The main impetus for Derek's change is internal: once he learns to respect himself, he starts respecting others--a nice thought, no doubt, but I'm not sure it would be a strong enough fulcrum for change in this character's racial views. Although some would assume that Derek is too intelligent to remain racist, I would assume he's too intelligent not to come up with yet more rationalizations.There are other factors at work, too, including his treatment by white inmates and his befriending of a charming black inmate (Guy Torry). But all this seems to provide, at most, an emotional response to the earlier scenes. The movie made me realize how much the public attitude toward race has changed since the late 1960s, when optimistic films like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" confronted racism by creating immensely likable African-American characters and ignoring any other social and cultural tensions that might pose a barrier to interracial relationships. In AHX, almost all the black characters are gang members and criminals, and there seems to be an underlying cynicism in the film's reluctance to provide a clear-cut refutation to Derek's right-wing arguments. Implicitly, the movie argues that there's a cycle of hatred going on between white and black gangs, and that the white racists aren't solely to blame for this situation. Aside from his relationship with Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and his prison friend, the basis for Derek's turnaround is largely negative: he realizes that he's no better than the black outlaws he so despises. That isn't exactly the most inspiring message about race relations.My main reason for wanting to watch this movie in the first place was to understand better how an extremist hatemonger could change. But that turns out to be the least convincing aspect of the film. The root of the problem probably lies in the conception. The filmmakers started with the intelligent skinhead character, then they thought, ""What sorts of events will lead this character to transform?"" That's why the conclusion feels just a tad contrived. It's a good film, overall, but ironically where it's weak is in the very area that makes the story the most interesting."
Movie_Buff_Brad,"Jul 16, 2007",10/10,"One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them.The acting is great all around, and Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of all time. I can't believe he didn't win best actor. While I haven't seen Benji's performance, I doubt he was half as good as Norton. The film is also highly inspirational and moving.How is it that this wasn't even nominated for best picture, while Crash was AND won? Crazy.This should be shown in schools."
lisa-13121,"Aug 28, 2019",10/10,I have LOVED this movie since the day I saw it! I own it & will never sell or give it away! It's topic will ALWAYS be relevant & controversial. I can watch it every few years or so & still love it as much as the first time!
bhester0806,"Jun 28, 2022",10/10,"Anyone who missed the 90's and early 00's never will know how big Edward Norton was, he ruled the world. But two movies were a step above all else and this is the second one. He owns this movie role and character in a spectacular fashion. After you watch this go watch the rest of the gold he was apart of in the 90's-00's. Fight club, Primal Fear, Rounders, The Score, Red Dragon, Italian Job, the illusionist, the Incredible Hulk, Pride and Glory, Stone. Watch them all."
dmaul711,"Apr 19, 2000",N/A,"When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family."
Ari-21,"Dec 9, 1998",10/10,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart."

rajatdahiyax,"Aug 19, 2014",9/10,"American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. It stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, and co-stars Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo.In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are inter cut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek"
KoRnNut-2,"Mar 1, 1999",10/10,Powerful portrayal of Neo-Nazi movement in America. Told in series of flashbacks. Flawless acting by Edward Norton. Does its best to make the point that no one is ever right aand no one is ever wrong. I have a friend who was a Nazi and a racist. But upon walking out of the theater after this movie he hung his head in shame. This is why the film industry began.
AlsExGal,"Feb 4, 2024",8/10,"Along with questions of morality, with Greek tragedy blended in. It's the sort of story that you absorb and get the sense that you've seen before, but still very powerful, raw, and moving. Still, it's not without its faults.I really loved Norton's performance here as Derek, but when it comes to the film's exploration of racism, its reasons, and why someone might turn away from it, I felt I wasn't learning anything new. In the scenes that provide background for why Derek is a skinhead, the blacks are portrayed as, overall, not characters I'd define as admirable (the basketball scene, breaking into his car, the general tone and feel of his introduction to prison).When Derek is a skinhead, he is articulate in defense of his views, which are quite detailed. His firefighter father is killed by a black drug dealer in the line of duty - He was putting out a fire at the dealer's house. This does not improve Derek's mood. In spite of his intelligence and leadership qualities he can suddenly lose control, and become violent, and this leads to actions out of all proportion to the situation - killing two black men who were breaking into his car - that put him in prison for three years.In prison is where Derek reverses course, but the reasons seem rather shallow. It boils down to being exposed to and befriending one funny likeable black guy that he works with in the prison laundry and two other very prison specific situations. Given the ardent nature of Derek's racism, it is hard to believe that this alone would turn him around or keep him turned around once he left prison and is out in the world again among his old influences.Its good points? It shows that such virulent racism can happen in normal families, to pretty normal looking people who have met with some tragedies and want to blame the ""other"". It also shows that change can occur through education - Once out of the Aryan brotherhood group in prison, Derek spends his time reading. I'd recommend this one, just understand there is lots of violence, sexual content, and strong language. It will never be on TV - It would only be 20 minutes long!"
bob the moo,"Nov 8, 2003",N/A,"Years have past since Danny saw his neo-nazi brother, kill several black males who were robbing his car.  Since he has been in prison, Derek's legacy has grown among the white gangs of the area and Danny has followed in his brother's footsteps.  When he writes a racist paper for school, his teacher makes his write a new paper, focusing on recent history  that of his brother and how he influenced him.  Meanwhile Derek leaves prison a reformed man with only the desire to repair the damage he once did to his family with his beliefs and his hate.I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves).  It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film.  Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his `sins'.  As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film.  It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment.  The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong).  The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction  the characters and the film's world seem very real.  The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point.  One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's `road to Damascus' experience in prison  it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in.  In b&w flashback he is at his best  a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug.  Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required.  In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow.  Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed  Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a `morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.Overall this is a good film, which occasionally struggles when it forces the issue in the `present' scenes.  However for the most part it is a powerful film which owes a lot to well captured themes and an excellent performance from Norton."
JS-War17,"Nov 26, 2019",8/10,"What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.But before I rate this film I would like to say that I was not a fan of the aspect ratio they chose to use, I know that this might not be the largest detail but I still wanted to bring it up. But I digress, so I chose to give this film a 8/10 just because I think there are a couple parts where it gets a little choppy and over narrated."
pmikejaqua-67480,"Oct 5, 2022",10/10,"While this was a tremendous movie, I have to say that many parts of it were extremely difficult to watch. Ed Norton did an incredible job of acting. His depiction of a violently racist skinhead was so convincing as to be terrifying and more than a little sickening. I actually had trouble remembering that this really was acting and that had Norton was in fact not really an angry, despicable skinhead. That's one hell of an accomplushment for any actor.Without giving anything away about the ending of the movie, I will simply say two things.I thought I knew what was coming, but I was wrong.The ending brought home the point of the whole movie with a power like to the fall of a giant hammer; and that point was not what one might have expected."
David-329,"Aug 9, 1999",1/10,"American History X tries teach us all a lesson about racism.  However, what it really teaches us is no matter how much talent you have (Edward Norton and Tony Kaye), you can still make an awful and pretentious movie.  The movie pulls off the tremendous feat of preaching more than a Baptist sermon, while simultaneously boring you to tears.  Tony Kaye was right to try to take his name off of it."
MovieAddict2016,"Sep 2, 2005",8/10,"""American History X"" is a bold and disturbing movie about family, racism and our own self-perceptions. Its main character is Derek (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother (Edward Furlong) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked.In jail Derek learns a few things about life, and racism, or more appropriately, himself, and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path.""American History X"" is not a pleasant motion picture. It begins in flashback, as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car. His brother, who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle, witnesses this event. It's a good message about negative influences, along with everything else.Much has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits. Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton (allegedly) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time. Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits, but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines, which are against the rules of the Director's Guild. He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as ""directed by Humpty Dumpty."" Then, musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema (the film's international distributor) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band. They later wrote a song, called ""NLC,"" bashing the company.Despite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film, above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline  even if the direction isn't always up to par.Edward Norton is simply superb in his role, showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut (in the Richard Gere thriller ""A Primal Fear""). Norton careens between the role of a raging, vicious supremacist and a kindler, gentler version of the same character; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor.The rest of the cast is good as well  Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles. (D'Angelo in particular, who portrays a sleazy alcoholic  a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the ""Vacation"" movies.) ""American History X"" isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release (mainly from viewers rather than critics, who were less kind)  it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one. The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level, visually, as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Schindler's List."" The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times.But it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an (overall) impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay. A must-see for all who can stomach its content."
gingerkris,"Sep 28, 2004",9/10,"Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this 
 film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & 
 white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and 
 shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic, 
 ironically by a British director.
 
 The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the 
 younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after 
 killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature & 
 brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. 
 
 AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist 
 sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are 
 embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek 
 becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by 
 youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo 
 Nazi propaganda. 
 
 The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a 
 steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually 
 embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very 
 apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends.
 
 Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the 
 prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own 
 demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by 
 his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be 
 that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the 
 Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with 
 his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being 
 influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change 
 his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right 
 side of humanity.
 
 I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to 
 change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want 
 is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants 
 the same for his brother. 
 
 Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds 
 tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by 
 mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and 
 intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by 
 the same man (Derek / Norton).
 
 Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. 
 
 To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which 
 provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on 
 every high school curriculum"
grantgoodrich-68267,"Oct 21, 2022",10/10,"This is in my opinion one of the best films in the last 50 years. The story, acting, directing etc are superb. The movie transitions between color and black and white perfectly for the script. There isn't a single scene, minus the end, where what happens is a good thing; however this film gives you what you hate to see while giving you what you expect. There isn't much more I can say about this movie or it's cast other than bravo and thank you for having the guts to do this film. I can't think of more to say about how much I like this film but I have to keep adding words to make the quota to make a review."
Adam-117,"Jun 11, 1999",10/10,Never have I seen a movie that was so raw and powerful. Edward Norton's performance was so good it was frightening. He definitely deserved the best actor award. I will be recommending this movie for a long time.
JayWolfgramm,"May 9, 2025",7/10,"""American History X"" looks at things backwards. Where a movie like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" looks at the positive impact one man can have on a community, this movie looks at the negative impact one person can have. Edward Norton plays Derek, a neo nazi who preached his white supremacy doctrine to as many people who would listen. After going to jail for 3 years Derek has had a change of heart. But he returns to see how his actions have negatively impacted his younger brother Danny and so many others. Once hate has been planted so deep, it becomes a hard weed to uproot. This movie is a powerful message; it is just a hard one to watch."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Nov 4, 2023",8/10,"Derek has grown up a very angry, racist man, after killing two black youths, he ends up in Prison. Derek goes through hell inside, but remains determined no tot allow his younger brother Danny, to go down the same path.I watched this when it was first released, it had a pretty harrowing impact on me, it really was a hard hitting, controversial film. I have revisited it for some years, but as time has gone on, I've been keen to see how it's aged.I was quite surprised by the relatively shorter running time, had this film been made today, I guarantee it would be at least three and a half hours long. It's held up very well with time, it painted a pretty bleak picture of society, sadly things don't seem to have changed a great deal.Some inspirational scenes, some shocking scenes, the ending and the shower scene you need to cover your eyes. The scenes between Derek and Danny are terrific, such acting.Ed Norton delivers a first class performance, he is outstanding, his character is mixed up, defiant, brave, angry, he adds a multitude of feelings and emotions into Derek. If ever you need reassurance of the brilliance of Norton, watch this.8/10."
SnobbyDude,"Mar 28, 2003",6/10,"I'm all over the place in evaluating this movie because the movie is a mess also. It's got a lot of good qualities and just as many bad ones.When you read the reviews of this movie, many people get the feel that it is a technical mess. I agree, that it was a technical mess too. I did enjoy it overall, but I didn't find it as enjoyable as it should have been. I have been thinking about this for a few days now since I have seen it. What was missing? I think it tries to bite off more than it can chew and that is its biggest weakness. It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions. The film is considerably bogged down by trying to solve a lot issues and emotion is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted. Then we wind up with a complicated mess of answers, which, for me, raised more questions, because I wasn't sure I was satisfied with the answers/solutions I was given.It is a good film with great performances, especially by Norton. This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching because I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind. I like to watch movies for entertainment, not to feel like I'm being taught/lectured to.Do I sound like I am having a hard time making up my mind about this movie?I am!I liked it, but I can't put it on my list of top movies because it was too predictable and not very believable. I predicted the ending in the about 10 minutes before it happened and knew what was going to happen in the flashbacks every step of the way.Another thing I was wondering about was realism....I don't live in CA, and have never been to the bad areas, but is it possible that black gang-members would ever play basketball in Venice (I think it was Venice) with Neo Nazi's? I didn't think that scene was realistic. Also, the movie makes it sound like Neo Nazis are a real threat to society, but how many skinheads are there? I've never met one before, let alone seen one...I think, these days, people think being unbiased and objective means looking at 2 groups of people and being equally harsh in judging both of them. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life, but I think in attempting to try to be ""fair"", the movie makes with people out to be a much bigger threat to society than they are. Is there anyone in the USA that is afraid to go out at night because of Neo-Nazis? I think, in attempting to be be unbiased, the movie discredits itself and becomes unrealistic. This is a shame, but the bottom line is that this is a VERY complicated subject matter. I doubt anyone could really make a film of this nature without making lots of missteps.Rather than trying to find a solution, they should have let the audience decide what to think. I got annoyed when I was spoon fed the ""hate is baggage line."" Let me figure it out on my own! The best movies are the ones that make you think, not the ones that try to think for you."
sybolies,"Jul 16, 2000",1/10,"For it's appeal this movie relied entirely on dramatics based on pseudo racial tensions -- just like you see in almost all everyday boring media -- and the dramatics take on the same worn out theme of white supremacy aimed at the underprivileged black. Of course classism and other infinitely weightier issues are ignored in this type of black-and-white scenario. This issue is so overdone and so inaccurate that movies portraying it are at once passe and dangerously erroneous from a social standpoint.If you like drama that rams its theme home by beating you over the head with theatrics, and if you are uneducated enough to believe that simple discrimination results from something as superficial as skin color, then you will probably like this movie and even think it's profound. If you appreciate the subtle beauty in life and understand how nearly all issues have depth beyond their specious veneer, this movie will just be another tired rendition added to the multitude of preceding ones that pivot from the same worn and ridiculous theme -- racism."
damianphelps,"Sep 1, 2020",8/10,"A really great movie that deals with a heavy topic, that is as relevant now as it was back then.Gritty and violent and very very passionate but nothing is done here just to titillate, it provides a truth to the story that would be insincere if it wasn't included.Does get a little bogged down at times and can be perhaps a bit too simplistic when dealing with the healing transformations of the characters. BUT it is a brave and challenging film that also remembers to entertain as well as educate."
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 2, 2015",9/10,"Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) grew angry after his firefighter father was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a drug den. He becomes a white supremacist under the tutelage of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). Along with girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk) and idiot Seth Ryan (Ethan Suplee), he aims to take back the neighborhood from the minorities. He kills 3 black guys who are breaking into his truck and gets sent to prison for 3 years. His brother Danny (Edward Furlong) idolizes him. However, Derek leaves prison a changed man as he tries to get his family away from his past.This is a shocking revealing portrayal of personal racism. Norton is insanely powerful. Furlong does some solid work as the teen with a chip on his shoulder. This is a movie worthy of recognition."
travurl52,"May 29, 2020",10/10,Air tight 2 hour runtime which wastes little dialogue. Extremely dramatic scenes that all have a part in gripping ending. An important story told in an amazing story. You will not regret watching this movie at all and it well deserves its place among the greatest movies of all time.
Mapock,"Oct 18, 2013",10/10,"The story is about the brothers Derek and Danny who are both smart and trying to questions things like in the society. When their father who's a firefighter goes into a black neighborhood trying to extinguish a fire he's shoot down by a drug dealer who happen to be a black person. Before this happened the father had told Derek about his racial opinions while they were eating one time. After the murder of his father Derek seeks to join a skinhead gang to avenge his father's death. one time later 3 black guys tries to jack his father's car from their front yard one night , Derek catches them and shoots one of them and brutally stomps on one the other guy's head killing him. Derek is convicted of manslaughter and will serve 3 years in prison.After the 3 years in jail Derek is a changed man. He has grown back his hair and become a loving and caring person , tolerating different people. Because of all the horrible things that happened in the prison.When he comes out he discovers that his little brother is going down the same path as him. And he desperately tries to save him.Why I like this movie is because that its shows us that hate only leads to suffering and despair. After his father is murdered, it's like it is his duty to stand up against the blacks in society. He joins up with Cameron and starts a skinhead gang, telling people to join because of the black and Mexican gangs who bully people. He seeks identification, he joins a side. But this is the a dead end I mean.Really good movie! top's notch!"
tgs-69358,"Jan 16, 2019",10/10,Best Movie Ever Made. Incredible acting and writing and heartbreaking and powerful. Will never forget this film and the way it made me feel.
divineflame06,"Jun 29, 2021",10/10,"Shockingly I never came across this film before. I'm glad I finally read about it and watched it soon after. This has to be one of the most powerful films ever made on racism. The story, performances, camera, music all feel so real and thought provocative. It tells the story of Derek, a white supremacist nazi skinhead and how he transforms and now just wants his little brother Danny to not go down the same path. The narrative is non linear where the past is periodically shown in B/W while the present is in color. One of the most haunting aspects of the film is it's background score which is among the best I have heard. The writing is balanced and nuanced and it shows. Because honestly the plot is slim but the screenplay they made out of it is bloody brilliant. The film explores hate and the effect it has on people. The constant struggle is there to see, some scenes are very hard to watch and are extremely violent on the eyes and mind. We have all seen films portraying racism in one form or the another. But there is something in this film which stands out among them. And that is Edward Norton's jaw dropping performance as Derek Vinyard. He lights the screen on fire in the scenes he is delivering dialogues which reek of hate. It was a laudable performance. But I was left wanting for more. I do feel a bit more of Derek's back story on his journey into becoming a white supremacist could have been explored to add another layer. The film has a brutal climax which I didn't expect at all. It kind of comes a full circle in the end. The final moments of the film ends with an Abraham Lincoln's quote written for a paper by Danny he submitted for his AMERICAN HISTORY X class. This is a film you cannot afford to miss. ABSOLUTE MUST WATCH!"
george.schmidt,"Feb 21, 2003",N/A,"AMERICAN HISTORY X (1998) ***1/2 Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Stacy Keach, Avery Brooks, Fairuza Balk, Elliott Gould, William Russ.  Unflinchingly brutally frank look at racism in America wnd the skinhead/neo-Nazis in particular led by a fireball, Oscar nominated performance by Norton as the eldest son of a family whose hatred beliefs turn inside out after a prison stint, and a chance to redeem himself by saving his younger, impressionable brother (Furlong) with only tragedy looming on the horizon.  Graphic in depiction and no-holds barred in its ugliness, the film succeeds in making even the most sickening characters shockingly human, perhaps the film's greatest testament: giving hatred a face.  Directed by Tony Kaye (who also did a superb job as cinematographer), the film became mired in controversy when Kaye wanted to remove his name from the film when the studio stepped in to make some cuts."
ma-cortes,"Sep 25, 2011",7/10,"This is an intelligent story of racial violence and xenophobia with countless violence and broody message . It happens in Venice , California and deals with a young man , a skinhead and leader of a violent white supremacist gang named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) previously seduced into the fascist bunch by Alexander (Stacy Keach) . The Nazi group follows a racist doctrine about white supremacy , showing the feeling for the male reality of reactionary working class environments . Meanwhile his problematic family torn apart , specially his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo). He goes to jail after committing a heinous crime , but while in prison Derek's view of mankind is altered, he discovers that there is good and bad in every race . When he is released , the former neo-Nazi skinhead attempts to prevent his younger brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself as Derek must save him from a similar destination from going down the same wrong path that he did . As his only thought is to steer his brother away from that same violent past and being helped by a reformist headmaster (Avery Brooks).Intense and thought-provoking drama with powerful performances and slick direction , being developed by means of flashbacks filmed in black and white and color . It's an important production about racism and Nazism but with lots of violence and unpleasant images as a frightening rape in the prison and the shocking murder at the beginning . Extraordinary acting by Edward Norton who steals the show as fanatic Nazi that committed acts of racial crime throughout and subsequently become good guy . Very good cinematography -specially the black and white fragments- by the same director Tony Kaye . Emotive and moving musical score by Anne Dudley , including some wonderful song . However , disowned by his director and reportedly reedited by its star . The motion picture is stunningly realized Tony Kaye , an unsuccessful director of a few films and documentaries who here achieved his big and only hit . Rating : Above average , essential and indispensable seeing . Well worth watching ."

view_and_review,"Jan 17, 2007",7/10,"""American History X"" is not a weak, fluffy, cutely wrapped after school special on racism, life in the 'hood, life in prison, and breaking the cycle. ""American History X"" is powerful and hits like an anvil. Edward Norton does an excellent job as Derek Vinyard, a venomous, hateful leader of a local gang of skinheads.The movie takes a singular look at a young man who is entrenched in the White Supremist movement, then how he emerged from that life, and even how he started down that path to begin with. Of course most people don't like racist bigots and the movie shows the very ugly nature of the skinheads/Arian Brotherhood. But the movie also shows the interaction between the Whites and Blacks in the 'hoods of L.A. There was by no means an angelic depiction of the African-Americans in this film. A few of the blacks shown were thugs who in part helped shape the views that Derek and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) held as White Supremists, but there were also a couple of key African-American characters that helped to reshape the views of Derek and Danny.""American History X"" made sure to do it right and make it true to life. The life Derek had before prison, the life inside of prison with the segregation and the gangs, and his life after prison as a changed man. This was no ""Mississippi Burning"" or ""Rosewood"" detailing events of the past, rather this was a movie showing the present, the good and bad in both parties, and the different ways people can be reformed."
bobarinobobalucci,"Sep 7, 2004",1/10,"I'm a bit bewildered by the praise heaped upon this film. Ed Norton does a good job and was just coming into his own at this point. His acting was not at the level it is today though. Furlong earned his money but did not shine in his role. Balk utterly failed to rise on this cinematic occasion and Keach showed up for the check.The story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film. I however staunchly disagree with its position at number 61 in the top 250 films. Ponder for a moment that Spartacus is over 100 films below American History X, that alone should give you pause.It would be accurate to say that votes from the younger, more internet savvy, could be held accountable for such an imbalance. Those who felt that Eminem deserved an Oscar for 8 Mile. In both instances the story had a degree of truth and realism but Oscars are for a chosen few. I urge generation x and generation next to take more than a mere cursory look at the fellow top 250. Did Norton deliver the role with the same intensity as Brando?""Contemplate this on the tree of woe."" James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom Conan the Barbarian (1982)"
dacmoviebuff,"May 21, 2021",10/10,"Edward Norton was spectacular and should have gotten the Oscar for his portrayal in this film. Considering the rise in white supremacists and racism recently, this movie should be required viewing in all high schools. People need to understand that there are consequences to your actions, and violence begets violence."

Kirpianuscus,"Jul 28, 2016",N/A,"splendid performances. powerful message. violent. realistic. obvious, a masterpiece. the force of this film becomes, decade by decade, more important. because it is not exactly a great film presenting a delicate theme in wise manner but a kind of guide for understand every day reality. it is not only a problem of racism or an American story but an impressive fresco of the challenges to meet the other. this is the key of its importance. the splendid performance of Edward Norton represents start point for self definition of each of film viewer. the tragic end is the most precise warning about the social expectation and the importance of the past in the social status perception. it is a special film for the virtue to represent a slice of reality. and this does it one of the films who could change its public."
Vic_max,"Dec 6, 2006",7/10,"The one reason to watch this movie is for the acting - it is intense - esp. concerning the lead character.The lead character is immediately interesting because he has a good mind - he is bright, clever, consistent and intense. He is impressionable yet searching for his own answers.From this character, we see how it is possible to uncover deep understandings - not about others, but about one's own self. Watching the lead character go through this process is what makes this movie so interesting.The rest of the movie doesn't quite match the interest level of the lead character, but it is still good. Because it involves racial tensions and Nazi references, it's easy to get drawn into the story quickly. Overall, I recommend watching the movie."
umlaziking,"Jul 6, 2022",10/10,"It's really sad to see what Hollywood has become, they seem to lack creativity and are more focused on becoming woke rather than telling an amazing story, but back in those days when they focused on writing a great and memorable storyline of a movie, you could easily tell that the filmmakers back then were extremely passionate with what they do and American history x is an amazing example of that. This movie is absolutely brilliant, if you think about it...it's the type of movie we are never going to see again. It had really strong and powerful life lessons that will stay with you forever, the characters are amazing and very inspirational as well. I really never understand how any normal human being can hate this movie...a perfect film that's a 10 and deserves to be in the top 250."

cadainoff,"Jan 21, 2005",1/10,"Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It reeks from start to finish, which is all the more painful because it was supposed to be good. Edward Norton sounds and looks more like the president of the Yale Republican Club than a white supremacist skinhead - the movies truly fatal flaw considering he's the linchpin of the whole thing. Elliot Gould as a woolly, ineffectual liberal is a stereotype, one of many in the cast.More troubling than the acting, though, is the direction, which could charitably be called confused. How else to explain why we end up rooting for the skinheads to beat the black guys in a basketball game to determine who will stay off the public courts of Venice for good. How else to explain that the skinheads actually win? On the Venice courts, where the level of play is so high that Ron Shelton actually set his own movie there (""White Men Can't Jump"")? This scene is symbolic of how completely out of touch this movie is, how it ignores basic realities to construct its own while purporting to tell the truth, and how confused its storytelling and direction are. If racism is so bad, why are the majority of the black characters so unlikable, and why do the white supremacist characters seem so much more sympathetic and their actions so much more understandable? These concerns would be mere quibbles if the movie didn't claim to be so much more than it actually is. It fails to convey its message, and it fails artistically. Everything about it just sucks."

I had no idea which direction the movie was going to go in but start to finish, it was amazing, so intense and so powerful.The black and white of the movie caught me off guard but it was brilliant choice as it just fit brilliantly with the morals and story in the film. I have never seen any movie like this, it walked you through all the highs and lows the 'skin head' lifestyle that Edward Norton's character lives, who by the way put on a phenomenal performance, he just commanded every single scene that he was in, who also did not even get nominated that year. The story was so rich and beautiful, from start to finish the movie had this tight grip on me where i just couldn't look away no matter how graphic some of the scenes were.I could just on and on, but just go watch the movie if you haven't already, and preferably watch it by yourself, you need to listen and feel and really immerse yourself in the movie which Tony Kaye made really easy for you. One more thing before i finish is the most powerful quote in the movie which i have already seen mentioned here, ""Has anything you've done made your life better?""."

I had no idea what it was about, all I knew is it was regarded as one of the best movies ever made and now I understand why. It could never be made today, things are too PC now and it would be placed under ""Cancel Culture"".. It was morally confusing at times, I had no idea who to root for.. Maybe other than Sweeney, his intentions was clear from the beginning. It was a strong movie indeed and the actors did a fantastic job! Namely Edward Norton. I'm not used to seing him in such a role but he actually nailed it. I'm a little disappointed he didn't win the Oscar this year but that's just how it goes I guess. Regardless, if you're not easily offended and you appreciate quality movies I would highly recommend you give this one a chance. Best of it's kind, truly."

chiragrathod09,"Jul 18, 2024",9/10,"""American History X"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that dives deep into the complexities of hate, racism, and ultimately, redemption. Edward Norton delivers a stunning performance as Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi who grapples with the repercussions of his past actions in a moving and deeply emotional narrative.The film's storytelling is raw and unflinching, using a non-linear structure that effectively reveals the backstory and gradual transformation of its characters. The black-and-white flashbacks juxtaposed with the vivid present day create a powerful visual narrative, emphasizing the stark contrasts between Derek's past beliefs and his quest for a better future.The themes explored in ""American History X"" are hauntingly relevant and serve as a critical commentary on the cycle of hate and violence. It challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about prejudice and the environment that fosters it. The film doesn't shy away from showing the devastating impact of hate not only on individuals but on families and communities as well.What truly sets ""American History X"" apart is its focus on redemption and the possibility of change. The emotional climax delivers a gut-wrenching reminder that the fight against hate is a continuous journey, one that requires introspection, courage, and understanding.""American History X"" is a must-see film that resonates on multiple levels. It's a haunting, beautifully crafted piece of cinema that leaves a lasting impact and sparks necessary conversations about forgiveness and the human capacity for change."
naomisoanes,"Jan 1, 2007",10/10,"Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) returns from prison to discover that his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), has been following in his footsteps, living the neo-Nazi life of racism and violence that landed Derek in prison. However upon Dereks return from prison, his fellow Hitler-worshippers notice a change in his behaviour and realise that Derek is free from the hatred he harboured for the people 'invading' his neighbourhood. The task that lies before Derek is to convince Danny to see the errors of his ways before it is too late. An awesome movie delivered by an excellent cast, a definite classic. There is quite a lot of violence... a lot of people object to the curb scene, but it is not particularly shocking, and not a film to miss because of it.

It still seems fairly unobtainable but at least now I understand the devastation that can await one who lets their anger consume them.Were I to have undergone the same chain of events as Derek (Edward Norton is brilliant), I reckon I'd invariably have reacted as he did, which isn't a pretty thought. What separates most antisocial young men from most healthy ones is pure luck, but of course there are also many who suffer that have the sort of perspective this film grants the viewer.Now, the cathartic relief of ruining my life - and the lives of those around me, which I hadn't truly considered before - isn't very tempting."

moonspinner55,"Jan 13, 2008",6/10,"Past and present collage of a youthful neo-Nazi skinhead in Venice Beach, California, his life going into a tailspin after the gang-related murder of his father. After killing some neighborhood thugs, the skinhead serves jail time and is eventually paroled (and reformed), yet he can't seem to straighten out his erratic family, particularly his younger brother who seems intent on following down the same ugly path. Director Tony Kaye puts the squeeze on us right from the start, staging a blacks vs. whites basketball game as if it were Epic Human Drama (photographed in black-and-white, with slow-motion effects and a heavenly choir). The superlative performances nearly carry the picture, yet screenwriter David McKenna lays on the be-true-to-yourself rhetoric with a trowel (and yet lets the opposite side get their licks in too, whittling the film down to a battle of speeches ladled with words like 'empowerment'). The jailhouse scenes are the strongest, but the family drama and the sidebars with the police (who also get to make speeches) are uncomfortably contrived. ** from ****"
Billy_Boy_,"Apr 29, 2025",10/10,"American History X is one of those movies that just sticks with you. It's raw, brutally honest, and doesn't pull
any punches. The story is intense from start to finish, and the way it handles themes of racism, hate, and redemption is both disturbing, yet deeply human.Edward Norton is absolutely incredible here - easily one of the best performances of his career. You believe every second of his character's journey, and the transformation he goes through feels earned and real. Edward Furlong also brings a lot of heart to the film, making the emotional impact hit even harder.The black-and-white sequences, the haunting score, the gut-punch of an ending - it all just works. It's not an easy watch, but it's an important one.10/10 - an essential, unforgettable piece of cinema."
fciocca,"Nov 7, 2022",10/10,"""American History X"" is not an easy watch, there are many uncomfortable scenes and the plot is very tragic. The director Tony Kaye and the screenwriter David McKenna built a believable story and developed one of the best and most complex characters that I have ever seen in my personal experience as a cinema lover. They completely explored Derek's story, explaining the origin of his hate, why he embraced a certain ideology and showing his redemption path. We get to see what he went through in its rawest and truest possible way. This made me empathize with the protagonist and his brother. Edward Norton is convincing in this role, his dialogues are difficult to be listened to because they go against an evolved society that is still fighting to get equality. Unfortunately what we see here is not too distant from reality as there are still extremist groups that have a dangerous mentality. All things considered, I guess that this was a real challenge for the actor, but he definitely nailed it. I really enjoyed the non-linear storyline, which made the film more intense. I loved the use of black and white during flashbacks, it adds uniqueness to the whole narration. The photography is fantastic and the director managed to capture the characters' emotions perfectly. There were certain face close-ups that surprised me.It is really difficult for me to describe this movie with words. It definitely made me think. Hate is complex and it usually has deep roots that need to be understood, in order to prevent the expansion of certain movements and ideologies that in the past caused a lot of violence and pain. This film for me is eternal: it will always feel actual and updated."

THE SAME rethorics. THE SAME rebutals.Even a casual viewer must be astonished when he hears the dialogues in this movie and then turns CNN, Fox, BBC, or opens a typical post on Twitter (or ""X"", for nature's fun pun with this movie).Nothing changed. NOTHING. And still the same old fears, still the same old trials and tribulations.Oh, yes - the fact that Norton did not win the Oscar just for this role is a travesty.

HardKnockLife210,"Feb 5, 2005",6/10,"Controversial subjects usually make for interesting movies, and American History X courts controversy in so many ways by examining neo-Nazis, racism, prison violence, and school violence all in the same movie. So American History X is a very interesting film, but it is executed so haphazardly that it becomes hard to enjoy, and it loses most of its potential and some of its power in the process.The film examines the life and crimes of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), both whom are ""involved"" in the neo-nazi movement. In exactly what ways they are (and were) involved are examined in the film, much of which is told through flashbacks. It is evident that these two boys have forced much hardship upon their families, evident in the performance of Beverly D'Angelo as the boys' mother. However, the performances of both Norton and Furlong, although adequate, are short of spectacular.Much of the action of the film is shot in pain-staking slow motion, making everything so over-dramatic that it's almost laughable. McKenna's screenplay is indeed interesting at points, but some of it too gets caught up on formulaic statements and unneeded dialogue. Many of the scenes seem unneeded and seem to need replacement by scenes that give more insight into Danny's mindset. Instead of these scenes, though, the viewer is left with a character who seems somewhat one-dimensional.Even with the slow motion, Kaye's direction and cinematography are unique enough to grab the viewer's attention, even when it does distract from the rest of the film. Also, the film is thought-provoking in its examination of racial matters, especially as we see through the eyes of characters so prejudiced. Further questioning and thought is provoked by the movie's ending, which is both beautiful and shocking in such an odd way that it almost makes the whole film worthwhile.It is obvious that this film is unashamed to say what it wants to say. Yet it's still a shame that American History X was not caught on film as something more powerful and profound in its display.Final Grade: B-."
mattatthemovies,"Oct 7, 2024",8/10,"With the rise of racism and right wing ideology around the world, this movie is perhaps more relevant today than it was back in 1998. American History X is a genius depiction of how young and impressionable kids can be radicalized into violent bigotry. It shows how hateful beliefs are often passed down from generation to generation.The cast of actors is truly excellent, from Edward Norton's academy nominated performance to superb supporting cast of Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, and Stacy Keach.The direction by Tony Kaye is top notch. I loved the pacing in particular, no scene felt unnecessary or undercooked. The use of black and white to differentiate flashbacks is also simple yet genius filmmaking.This is an excellent piece of cinema and something I strongly recommend every person watch at least once."
adamonIMDb,"Sep 24, 2017",6/10,"'American History X' is a decent but flawed drama about Derek, a former neo-Nazi who, after serving time in prison for the murder of a black man, reforms himself and tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny, from following in his footsteps. The film cuts back and forth between the past and present, showing us what Derek used to be like and the path that his younger brother is at risk of going down.It's a solid drama and an interesting enough watch, but with an average rating of 8.5 it's also massively overrated. Several parts of the film feel forced and not at all convincing, especially the ending which was over-the-top and completely unnecessary. The film contains enough drama without the need for an forced and overdramatic ending that contributes very little to the story other than some blood and violence. Overall, 'American History X' is a decent but overrated drama film."

fernandoschiavi,"Dec 6, 2022",8/10,"Considered one of the greatest films of all time, we can easily define that ""Our American History"" does not have an exact time to be based or portrayed, as the criticism it makes is conducive to any generation. We are talking about a production that does not criticize neo-Nazi thoughts, but society in general. The production is about prejudice, changes and reflections, something we thought we had overcome, but which sometimes seems so common in the 21st century.The Other American Story, feature film directed by Tony Kaye that tells the story of a skinhead (Edward Norton) arrested for murdering two black people and who tries to save his brother (Edward Furlong) when he returns home. The film follows two narrative lines: a past in black and white, exposed as a work of his brother for school, and the present, in color, with Derek's return to the house. These color changes are meant to show the conflict of right and wrong. Derek's past is always presented in black and white, as if it were a dark stain on his reality, while the present is given bright colors to make it clear that he is no longer that man. As Dan is the narrator, the story is based on his own point of view about his brother and the reality he lives in (where only white people seem to deserve a place on the planet).Derek Vinyard, lived by an excellent Edward Norton (Brooklyn: Motherless), embodies two people. Not that one is better than the other. The dislike for his character persists after the ice is broken by his fellow prisoner, when he suffers the violence he preaches or even in his moments of despair. It's with him forever, just like the swastika he carries on his chest. The character knows this and the director is keen to expose the feeling in the way he looks in the mirror.While the two brothers Derek and Danny appear to be strong and intelligent, they demonstrate incredible psychological fragility and are easily manipulated. An example: there is a scene in which Derek, still a young man, is talking excitedly about how he felt urged to study by his new teacher. Derek's father (an uneducated and prejudiced man) questions him with a rural speech, but that is enough to change the firstborn's initial opinion. Why, years later, Derek would again be manipulated by Cameron and become an asshole neo-Nazi. And finally, he would change his mind after a new meeting with his old teacher and by his own negative experiences with his lifestyle. Dan is the same. Tired of being just his brother's reflection, he decided to follow in the same footsteps. He was indoctrinated by Cameron, but his fuel to participate in that nonsense was just the love and admiration for his brother. So much so that when Derek recounts his experiences, he changes his mind drastically.The film focuses on supremacist acts that flaunt hatred of black people. Racist and xenophobic speeches are part of Derek and his friends' playbook. The protagonist's actions, more than his speech, show that lives do not matter, they are something irrelevant. And there is an expansion, when he talks about stimulating racism in the country itself, when he compares crimes and penalties. David McKenna's screenplay pays little attention to causes and focuses on hate, even though it establishes the planted seed. His interest is in the misrepresentation of the individual at the moment when dehumanization takes place. Satellite characters confirm degeneration, in punctual disrespect, as in any interaction of Seth, or in Cameron's manipulative cynicism. Art that looks over the top but might not be, exposes every Nazi symbol it can manage. And Kaye does not skimp on the use of objects, highlighting boots, iron crosses and making counterpoints with the American flag.American History X pervades historical situations. There are the attacks on Rodney King, the trial of the police and the uprising in Los Angeles to reach the level of propagandist blindness that affects people who have fascism inside them and decide to assume it. ""The video was manipulated"", ""the prison system is made up mostly of black people"", says Derek without listening to anything his interlocutor tries to say. A hateful blindness that cannot see any other side than the one he wants to believe in. And much of the film's tension is in the efficiency of the script's dialogues, but mainly in the close-ups that the director insists on keeping in practically all the scenes where the conversations are more serious, as in the moment when Dan argues with the school principal. As the camera is right on the actors' faces, which is another demonstration of the trust the director had in his cast (and in their quality, obviously), the spectator feels all the pressure of the scene.The central objective of the film is to show the characters as human, flawed beings, showing that this thinking is not exclusive to monsters, but to people with a weak, fragile and desperate mind, who cling to a dishonest, immoral and opportunistic speech due to lack of of choice, making use of values common and dear to all to establish itself as a dominant behavior. Upon his return from prison, Derek's transformation isn't just physical. He lost 22 kilos, grew his hair and is embarrassed to be shirtless precisely because of his tattoos. Upon returning from prison he really looks different, demanding morality from his relatives. It is only after some time of exhibition that it is elucidated how the scene at the beginning ended, and how violent and serious the action of the central character was. Danny changed and became a skinhead after watching his brother kill a black man in cold blood. That was the moment when both would drastically change, the beginning of the process of redeeming one and deteriorating the other.David McKenna's script is so frank and pragmatic that it does not allow itself to be dreamy or naive, showing that the destinies of people who get involved or get involved with ideas of this nature or with pure and simple intolerance, tend to suffer, even if they repent and live differently. American History X accurately shows how fascism can easily touch ordinary people, helping to evoke the worst possible feelings, dominating hearts and minds with ease, and leaving only a trail of blood and sadness in its wake.This is also the classic example of a feature dominated by its performances and the story it has to tell. Not only is Norton spectacular, but Furlong gives the performance of a lifetime, and Guy Torry, the black prison worker, gives us a wonderful and moving performance, so inevitably other technicalities end up being hidden - which doesn't absolve from not maintaining the very high level of the film. Tony Kaye's assured direction; the cinematography, subtly dark, working with black and white during flashbacks and playing with colors throughout the film, evoking an indescribable feeling of insecurity in moments that have more morbid tones. The soundtrack by the great Anne Dudley, who had already won an Oscar the previous year, is perfect in every moment.The conclusion is that, through Derek's story, is that hate arises primarily from ignorance and a lack of empathy. Being white, born American and having had a minimally good living condition, Derek was unable to understand the socioeconomic inequality between whites and blacks, or the inhumane conditions in many countries that lead people to seek exile in the United States and Europe, until having been arrested and forced to admit all this from experience. But then he had already killed two people and lost 6 years of his life, with the risk that his brother would be next. Due to the blunt script, filled with very well written dialogues, which faithfully illustrate the last paragraph and for one of the best performances by Edward Norton, American History X is highly recommended, especially in the current world context in which we see prejudices as odious as racism and xenophobia being defended again around the world."
gareth242000,"Jan 31, 2010",6/10,"This in my opinion is not a bad movie by any means, but i was just scrolling down the list of the top films by ways of votes on IMDb and saw how highly this movie was rated and how much it has impressed. I do think its quite good and of course its controversial, but i can't help thinking that its getting as much credit as it has for being just that. It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't. We all know racism is a bad thing so to have it spelt out and then have the rather obvious idea of redemption but paying for your sins or for your actions (being accoutable) for your eventual loss is a little obvious"
jtamburi,"Apr 16, 1999",5/10,"American History X is basically a fairy tale.  It is a film about one man's implausible 3-step transformation from a naive high-school kid to a white-supremist Nazi and leader of a skinhead tribe, to an honest caring upstanding citizen who only wants to do the right thing for his family and society at large.  Like I said, a fairy tale.  I won't  reveal any more of the ending that wasn't already revealed on the preview.  Basically it's a mixed happy/sad ending, where the ""happy"" part is that the main character finally comes to terms with who we was, how evil he was, the way his evilness has negatively influenced the lives of other people, and is able to write a nice cheery new chapter in his life.  And all this happens in a short 4 years.What gets me is how unbelievably intelligent and level-headed the main character (played by Ed Norton) is, and how completely silly his transformation into a skinhead really is.Meanwhile his kid brother (played by Ed Furlong) who is also reasonably smart, follows in his brother's footsteps like a zombie.  Norton's character is clearly free-thinking and is not one to follow in other people's footsteps, while Furlong is just the opposite.  At least Furlong's character gives the impression that he might flip and go completely nuts at any given time, thereby adding some mystery to the film (Furlong is good at looking like a punk). But the reality is much more like a fairy tail.So basically the film doesn't know what it wants to be.  One the one hand, it deals with some incredibly moving race issues, and on the other hand we have a children's movie.I think The Chamber by John Grisham actually did a much better job at portraying a racist who slowly & reluctantly repents and finds the error in his ways, at the last possible moment.  At least in that film, we understand that we're dealing with someone who, at his core, is really not a very nice man.Just the opposite in X.(5 out of 10)"

HonestApeAbe,"Feb 6, 2025",9/10,"A great story about a man looking deep into his inner hatred in a nice lesson about what that exactly brings you towards the bigger picture in life, emptiness. Edward Norton brings a great performance and this film represents the simple notion of how angry young men are so impressionable and can be easily manipulated to follow into propaganda and gangs. Something I didn't hear mentioned to much about this film before seing it but would like to point out is it's great filmography is. Overall it's a great story about the dangers or bigotry and hatred and letting those emotions dictate your life."
sametyetimoglu,"Sep 14, 2022",9/10,"I have never seen a movie with a realistic encapsulation of complex human behaviour like this one has. Things flow naturally: we get scenes with deep conversation and basic human interaction, but the second something happens, it's sudden and straight in your face. There is never much of a build-up, but it manages to make it work. 'Show, don't tell' is utilized in subtle body language, which bring a much deeper meaning to certain scenes. I also like the close-up shots for a more dramatic effect, and the unique directing style is very refreshing. The beginning hooks you straight in.What I first thought to be just another generic movie turned out to be one I'll remember for life. I am in love with this movie."
akshatmahajan,"Aug 30, 2020",9/10,"This is one of the best movies, I have ever watched. It was such a nice and different experience. Edward Norton's acting was masterful such that you can understand every little pain he felt and caused. His smile and manner switching before and after was so distinguishing. Movie's cinematography was also amazing; both black and white phase were amazing. The film ran smoothly and hands off to the director for making this movie such a gem along with shocking and unexpected ending. At last, I can say that you can watch this movie anytime."
lee_eisenberg,"Apr 12, 2006",9/10,"My 9/10 rating is because ""American History X"" is very well done in every way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked him what became of his humanity. Then again, maybe they wouldn't know what to say in such a situation.But other than that, the movie is quite good. Portraying a reformed Derek trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming a white supremacist, we get to see various issues. For example, when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the first time, his anger starts to ebb. Good support from Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach and Fairuza Balk make this a very good movie, even if they didn't develop it as far as they could."
filipe_feliciano,"Feb 11, 2020",6/10,"The way people talk about this movie, i really thought this was a hollywood masterpiece i had been missing out on for years. After finally having seen it, i can say it was certainly forgettable. The idea and subsequent story actually has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by the movies weird cinematography (black and white to show scenes in the past??) and quite frankly terribly dialogue and acting by everyone except for Norton, who i thought was the only solid actor. Not terrible, not great. Could have been so much better."

There are so many people who think like him and he dove into this role headfirst, without any apologies.  This movie, along with Irreversible, has one of the most violent scenes put to film, and it is very hard to shake off (even though it happens off screen).  Norton's performance is equal to anything DeNiro did with Scorsese."
Michael-100,"Apr 14, 1999",4/10,"There's been a lot to do about nothing when it comes to this film. While watching it I was struck by the preachy nature of the film. Like I was watching an old high school film about racism and hate. The film is extremely cliched and, at times, simply formulaic with a stapled on ending which tries to add an ironic nature to the film but only ends up causing the film to suffer from the old Hollywood adage of ""serious films have sad endings"".The most blatant example of the poor story telling is when Derek is in prison and he realizes that black people simply aren't evil. The way in which this comes about is scriptwriting at it's worst. There was much to do about the directing but the film is filled, once again, with poor work. Kaye was said to have done his own camera work on cinematography. It's obvious that professionals should have been used. The only saving grace is Nortons fine acting which is lost among the many flaws of the film. Better films about racism and hate have been made. Skip this one."
WorldMovie99,"Jan 23, 2025",10/10,"Where to start ? OK. Firstly it's a straight 10 from me. A definitely one of the greatest film ever made. The film simply just doesn't go out of my mind now. I also don't want to forget about it. It's a true gem of a film that appeals not to American but to all families of the world. I would thank Tony Kaye for depicting the naked character of American society behind all the fancy of western Media. This film taught me how Americans are same as Indians or Africans on ground realities of families.American History X is not about history of America, rather a home assignment of the same name given to danny, the movie's narrator by his school teacher. This assignment makes Danny thoughtful about Derek-his elder brother, about his family issues, about society and most importantly about truth of life. The film progresses through a lot of incidents and events in flashbacks with all focusing on present -- Danny's assignment.The film in summary tells the story of Derek, who is now a parole officer and his journey of life--- what's Derek previous life is all about, what's the big change in it and how it all impacted his family and in what ways. American history X is all about an American family with common problems of life trying to live with struggle without the support of a father. The film has message, no doubt about that, perhaps reflecting more stronger message than any other film I've ever seen. It involves family issues, racism, mistakes of young life, the shameless pride, guilt ridden lives, selfish agendas, heartbreak and so much more. American History is really at a different level of storytelling, not attempting to but straightforwardly connects with our hearts and mind. This film really penetrates the soul, makes us thoughful, makes us sad, makes us learn about society, makes us to be aware of our steps in lives. The film delivers a lot of it, and that's too with brutal honesty. I would never mind the R-Certifiation due to the standard of the intention.Tony Kaye directed the film with a modern taste of narratives, with a modern set up of society too. So many flashbacks and jumps from past to present moments without a single spot of flaw or loosening grip. It simply locks up the attention till the climax and displays the emotional wound of Danny's poetic narratives, who finally understood where the real problem was. Nevertheless the film ends in tragedy where the Mother's son was sacrificed to make the father's Son understand deep. Derek's (Edward Norton) words -- 'What have I done' with tears tells a lot about what's not in silver screen and what's depicted.From filmmaking perspective its a top notch teamwork. From story to presentation, from acting to messages, the film deserves a standing applause. My favorite scene is when both brothers after realization unites to clean the room from all hate inciting environment. But American History is not about film making or script but about human lives, how people are in real world, how families struggle in ground level, how things are in modern world today. This film is not for entertainment but for learning the nakedness of increasing decent society. There's so much I could write and also want to but stopping here now, considering the boredom of my readers. Final statement -- Just watch it.A full 100/100, without a second thought."

suzi-75611,"May 18, 2020",10/10,"American History X had me gripped from the opening credits to the very end and is so strong for so many reasons. I actually found it hard for my brain to switch off when I went to bed afterwards, as it made such an impact I couldn't stop thinking about it.All of the black and white flashback scenes are completely captivating and are perfectly balanced with the present day story. The neo-nazi beliefs that the Vinyard brothers share are not just simply portrayed - they are explored in such a way that we discover seeds and roots and how the two characters have sunk to having such ideologies.The writers, along with Edward Norton and his incredible portrayal of Derek, the eldest brother, did a remarkable job of making you truly believe that the characters were capable of redemption, something they started building on early on, which carried the film the whole way through.Every character no matter how small provided interesting roles and thought provoking interactions and every single scene felt integral to the story.
This is such an emotional, enjoyable and harrowing watch and I think everyone should see this!!"
stejk-26552,"May 24, 2025",10/10,"The title of this review is the same as the offical polish title of the movie. Personally, I think it perfectly describes the character of Derek.Hatred, is what often imprisons us. It doesn't allow us to look at things objectively, to truly understand the true root of our problems. Instead, it makes us put the blame onto others, because we are too afraid to face the truth.Nothing good can come out of this hatred, it only grows like a tumor. We often fail to see how by spreading it, we only solidify the reasons for it existing in the first place.An aspect of this movie that I don't think is talked about enough, is nature vs nurture. It's not where who we are born as or the color of our skin that defines us, but the things that we grow up with, the people that surround us, the prejudices that others have towards us, that's what really shapes us.I could go on and on about how impactful and meaningful the story of this movie is. But it would be something that others had already stated hundreds if not thousands of times before me. But I think I said what I wanted to say.Overall, it's an incredible piece of film with an important social message that everyone should know about. Not to mention the
astounding performance by Edward Norton and how well executed it is on the technical level. In my eyes, it's deserving of nothing less than a 10/10."
unityenator,"Jun 15, 2013",N/A,"American History X is a incredible and brilliant view on racism that has become one of the most loved and acclaimed films of all time. The plot shows us the terrible views of racism and how the people who support it are like, it does it incredibly just by showing us what could happen to a man like Derek Vinyard, who is simply just a brilliant character and was amazing to watch, his brother Danny represents how racism spreads through family and how we should teach them not to treat other this way. The cast is great as well, Edward Norton plays his best performance I have ever seen since Fight Club and this may be the best acting of his career. Edward Furlong was also great and was the best child performance of 1998 and he did an amazing job. American History X is one of my favorite films of all time. It is intense, vulgar, and overall truthful which is what made it so genius, but overall just an incredible film that most people I think need to experience."
ronakkotian,"Aug 13, 2021",7/10,"Edward Norton has been an underrated actor in my eyes. Delivering great performances in films like Fight Club, Birdman and Moonrise Kingdom, there's no doubt he's an outstanding actor. His performance in American History X is some of his best work.American History X follows Derek Vinyard, a former neo-nazi skinhead that tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same path he did.The widespread love for this film got me interested to watch it. What I admire is how far they went with a subject matter like this. Its portrayal of racism is unflinching throughout with sequences that truly had me on edge and even shocked me. The film doesn't hold back and I found that to be helpful to get into and understand Derek Vinyard's perception of the world. The use of black and white during the flashbacks was an excellent choice as I felt it was very representative of the hatred and violent nature Derek possessed. Not only that, it added a murky feeling to the film that suited the dark and angry tone of the film. My main issue with American History X is how the film depicted Derek's reformation. Witnessing the large amount of hatred and racism built up inside of him, I found to be quite unbelievable how quick he was able to switch against his morals. For me, this weakened the film as this was the entire character development Derek had but it didn't come across as very believable. In addition, the ending is also something I'm not sure how I feel about. The best part of American History X is Edward Norton. He always manages to disappear into the characters he plays and Derek Vinyard is no exception. He lives and breathes this role and does an incredible job playing him. Edward Furlong as Norton's younger brother is also very good.American History X does have a lot of interesting things to say. The filmmaking is very well done and Edward Norton delivers an exceptional performance but I think the story required more subtlety and needed more to happen in Derek's life to make his reformation more believable in my eyes."
Msbnitski,"Feb 3, 2023",10/10,"I have watched this movie so many times that I can't count how many. It has a powerful message to people of different races and religions. I believe that people can relate and pretend that they are not the focus group but, to many groups know exactly who they are and what they believe. That's the truth behind this entire movie, people want to hide behind their beliefs and the blatant truth is simple, people hate others because they don't understand or listen to each other. Learn from the mistakes of people and love each other like they are all your own family.Life is short and when you look at the simple possibilities of life you should forget as to why you hate for the simple fact of hatetred of others. The past few years should have taught us something, to hate one another is to never learn about who we are and this movie shows us this."
mohamadrezat-03741,"Apr 6, 2024",7/10,"""American History X"" has some great parts but also boring ones. Derek's character switches from tough to weak, which feels odd. The ending comes too fast and needed more story before it to make sense.The movie should have shown earlier how the hate grew between the young black boy and the young white boy to explain the shooting better.In ""American History X,"" while some scenes captivate, others drag, undermining its pacing. The portrayal of Derek, oscillating between a dominating presence and vulnerability, strikes an odd chord, diluting his character's credibility. Moreover, the abrupt ending, a pivotal moment intended to underscore the cycle of hate, lacks the necessary buildup to fully convey its message. The narrative needed to establish the growing animosity between the young black and white boys earlier, providing a clearer context for the film's tragic conclusion, thus ensuring a more coherent and impactful storyline."
djw-6,"Jan 20, 2000",1/10,"It's rare that I turn down an opportunity to see a film for free.  It's even more rare that I regret having done so.  American History X was so strikingly bad though that I'm considering an attempt to sue for my wasted time. :-)The Plot:  Give the audience some credit!  American History X was painfully heavy-handed.  The word, ""Duh,"" sprang to mind (and often mouth) every few seconds.  Challenge us...make us thing...leave some loose ends.  Ed Furlong's 18-hour redemption plan?  Please!The Cinematography:  I don't know who's to blame; my guess is Tony Kaye. How could something smack of pretension and look like an MTV show?  Cut, pan, cut, pan, slow-mo, black-and-white.  The camera work is symbolic of the film.  Kaye never visually engages the characters and perhaps that's part of the reason that AHX is so ineffectual.Ed Norton did what he could with a weak script and a poor director. Unfortunately, the most impressive thing about the movie was the way Norton changed his body for the role.  Tony Kaye (understandly) tried to remove his name from this ""opus"" and claimed that Norton was responsible for the editing.  If that's true, let's hope Ed Norton sticks to acting and Tony Kaye goes back to music videos."
CurtisB-9,"Apr 9, 2025",10/10,"Not only is this film an amazing example of filmmaking, it is arguably more relevant today, 27 years later, than ever before. That is the a key characteristic of great films, they are timeless.There are countless stories online of Edward Norton being a pain to work with, and his endless need to impose himself on the script. Where there's smoke, there's fire and typically this would make me want to hate an actor or a film, yet I simply cannot dislike American History X nor his performance. He is superb in this, as always, and the film earns its right to be used as a case study for all film students for generations to come. Frankly, it should be taught in schools worldwide."
trav-36,"May 8, 2021",10/10,If you don't want the world to stay like this with prejudice and injustice then the next generations need to learn from movies like this one. Brilliant perfoemances by ALL of the actors and writing with a story that is unmatched!

lutkusmanagement,"Sep 14, 2020",10/10,One of the best movies ever. Severely underrated. Should be much morr of a classic than it already is.
eddie_baggins,"Apr 14, 2019",10/10,"Considering the behind the scenes drama (largely that persisted around its director Tony Kaye walking away from the film with its star Edward Norton taking over editing duties and overseeing the final cut), it's incredible just how powerful and accomplished of a film American History X ended up becoming.A confronting, heartfelt and in many ways life-affirming tale of the detrimental aspects of racism and its destructive powers on humankind, Kaye (and Norton's) film isn't an easy watch but these 20 plus years on since its initial release have done nothing to dampen to the effect the film can have on viewing.Starting out by focusing on a terrifying and horrific home invasion gone wrong, then turning its attention to examining the life of Edward Furlong's confused teenager Danny and his older brother Derek played by an Oscar nominated Ed Norton, who are both dealing with a deep seeded racist view that has shaped their lives, American History X casts a wide net as it morphs and moves between situations and scenarios that showcase the best and worst of what humankind can conjure up.In many ways the story of Danny and Derek, as the two brothers reconnect after Derek's release from prison for the murder of two black youths, seems rather simple but through these two viewpoints, we as an audience get to experience a wide ranging set of situations and emotions that refuses to point the finger, rather unblinkingly ask the hard hitting questions while showing us the audience the true eye-opening nature of the hatred that is prevalent in America and the world.In these two central figures we also get a double dose of outstanding acting performances.It's easy to forget that at one stage the now troubled Furlong was one of the industry's brightest stars while Norton was very much establishing himself as one Hollywood's brightest talents, fresh off a memorable turn in Primal Fear and soon to be seen in the ground-breaking Fight Club, Norton is a commanding force of nature in this tale, with his transformative turn as Derek one of the era's most noteworthy lead turns.From our first few encounters with Derek he appears to be a man of few redeeming qualities, an unashamed racist that sees violence as an answer to problems within his community and within his very soul but as we begin to understand Derek's journey and soulful home truth lessons, the true quality of the construction of Derek the character and Norton's unforgettable turn begin to really take shape.With American History X's high placing in many film fans viewing lists, its unquestionably due largely to the fact that Norton so powerfully brought home the films messages through his turn as a young man's troubled path to understanding.Final Say -As powerful and resonate today as it was upon release, arguably even more so in our current climate, American History X is cinema at its most confronting but also at its most powerful, meaning its place as one of most quintessential pieces of cinema is well and truly deserved.5 bags of laundry out of 5"
littlemsleah18,"Feb 5, 2015",N/A,"I personally loved this movie. I've probably watched it a total of 20 times over the years and never gotten tired or bored of it. I think the perfect cast was selected for this movie. I love how you watch the 2 main characters evolve into the people they become at the end of the movie. I don't recommend any one who can't stand race issues to watch this movie. I love how this movie raises awareness of a lot of the racial issues that we are still having today. My favorite part would have to be the ending. This movie was definitely a tear jerker and have you feeling so many emotions threw out the movie. Must see movie, I rate it an A+."
skullhead739,"May 24, 2020",7/10,"Acting:
The cast was great. Everyone gave really good realistic performances that made you feel whatever the director wanted you to feel. The characters were developed well and you cared for them a great deal.Story:
This has a real hyperreaslistc vibe to it. It feels almost like it's based off a true story because I'm sure there are many stories like this. It brings you through a story of hate, anger and redemption. The characters and your feelings develop along with the story and I cant say enough how well this was directed. I just really dont understand the meaning of the end however. Without spoiling it, why the heck would someone get shot over just staring at another person? That's the most ridiculous thing ever. Especially in a place where it happened. Seems most unrealistic and left a bitter taste after such a redeeming story. I'm really not sure what the director was thinking and that's my only complaint about this film.Summary:
This is a very realistic, serious and emotional movie. I really didnt like the last bit of the ending but I would still recommend this movie as it still has a lot to offer."
nateris,"Apr 1, 2025",10/10,"American History X is one of those movies that stays with one for a long time. Some people may not be able to get past the excessive profanity, but you will find superb acting all across the map from an amazing cast.Avery Brooks delivered an incredible performance as Daniel's principal and Derek's former history teacher. There is so much strong character development in this movie that up until the tragic ending you feel emotional up to the climax.This was Edward Norton's second major acting role apart from Primal Fear (1996) and personally to me, Norton is one of the underrated actors in all of film cinema.The prison scenes are brutal but shows how Derek regretted who he once was and how prison had changed his perspective on life and his formerly racist self.I highly recommend this movie and believe everyone should see it!!"
krational66,"Apr 6, 2020",6/10,"Change too fast lack of convincing, and the beginning of the murderous handsome is not proportional; Hatred will not disappear easily. Hatred is the fangs of human killing, which cannot be eliminated by ""truth, kindness and beauty"" and so-called belief. The addition of a star to NORTON, however, was too much for the actor's acting alone to sustain such a heavy and grand theme."
romain-4,"Jun 15, 1999",1/10,"One of the worst films I've ever seen.There is just one degree, the first. It's a postal card, without thoughts, without vision, and full of clichés !!!"
KellyMichelleWatson,"Feb 25, 2019",10/10,"American History X is my all time favorite movie. Edward Norton was unbelievable in this! I first saw it when it came out many, many years ago. I actually watched it a few weeks ago. It's a classic. A must see. You have to understand that there are parts that will make you want to close your eyes. Just know, it is worth watching. Edward Norton is an incredible actor, actually they all are. It's a real movie, because sadly it is happening. Let's all put an end to Racism. I love everyone! People are beautiful, culture is beautiful."
millie-wild,"Sep 9, 2013",10/10,"Edward Norton's compelling and powerful performance of a highly misguided neo-nazi convict is a gripping and highly convincing one, and alongside Edward Furlong, this is an unmissable but hauntingly true interpretation by Tony Kaye that really brings home a message that's stuck with me forever.Whether it was just a cleverly written script, a good director or an excellent cast, I'll never know but what ever it is, it works and it works very well.Both Edward's reflect their prime ability to act with their portrayal of a fractured background and how it's influenced their behaviours and attitudes. It's an emotion evoking display from all the cast and a classic, classic film."
transelite,"Mar 12, 2023",10/10,"I have rewatched this movie so many times that it's due for a personal review. Edward Norton is nothing short of amazing. His character really portrays the transition of hatred, to finding peace through realisation that his past was leading him and his brother in the wrong direction. Edward Furlongs character shows how we can look up to our elders and get influenced. Whether right or wrong, leadership stems from someone looking at someone's actions.This movie resonates with many because this is actually happening somewhere in the world. Hatred is being fuelled by what is shown on social media and the scary thing is, it's easily accessible on your personal phone.This is a great movie again and I highly recommend it."
preppy-3,"May 17, 2003",8/10,"A white supremacist Derek (Edward Norton) is sent to jail for brutally killing two black men who try to steal his car.  Through some harrowing experiences in jail he realizes his way of thinking and living was wrong. He gets out and tries to prevent his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming the same as him...but is it too late?First off I'm giving the film an 8.  I thought is was excellent but it does have problems--it's overlong (I was bored more than once); there's way too many slow-motion sequences; there's disjointed editing; a finale I saw coming from a mile away and an annoying tendency to cut from b&w to color constantly.  Those issues aside the film is great.The script and imagery is strong and graphic (as it should be) and there's some great acting here.  Norton is just superb (he was Oscar-nominated); Furlong is subdued but good as Danny--a lot of his emotions come through in his eyes; Beverly D'Angelo was just great as their mother and Fairuza Balk is frightening as Norton's girlfriend.  The only bad acting was by Avery Brooks--but he's not really a main character so it doesn't really hurt the film.Some of the sequences in here were very difficult to watch (the attack on the store, the prison sequences and the finale) but they're meant to be that way.  This movie hits you over the head with its message but it does work. It just didn't affect me that strongly.  As I said, I saw the ending coming from a mile away so it didn't shock me at all.  Still, it is a powerful film.  Well worth catching.Also there was a huge amount of controversy when this was released.  It seems the director (Tony Kaye) accused New Line Studios of letting Edward Norton into the editing room and cut the film himself (this is no shock--Norton is known as a control freak).  He requested his name be removed from the credits and replaced with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.  He didn't win his request.  If Norton did indeed edit this film--he shouldn't quit his acting job.  The editing here is herky-jerky and the film could easily lose those slomo sequences."
myrrth_sicopath,"Oct 28, 2003",10/10,"American History X is the most provocative film ever made. It will make you think, it will make you cringe, it will make you cry. Dealing bravely with issues of supremacy and racism, American History X goes where few films ever attempt to go, and it does it perfectly.Edward Norton gives his strongest dramatic performance, playing a very believable, supremacist older brother reformed by experiences in prison. His character is one of the many in this movie that are brutally convincing and real. Edward Furlong plays an equally realistic, impressionable younger brother.If you can see past the swearing and violence, which is SUPPOSED to leave you feeling dirty, then you can see the real message of this fantastic film. I cannot stress enough how important this movie is to modern day America.A+"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 5, 2018",7/10,"'American History X (1998)' is an uneasy, sometimes downright uncomfortable film that pulls none of its punches and refuses to make any judgement on its closed-minded characters, even at the cost of potential audience alienation or possible misinterpretation. Its this very fact that gives it its power because it ultimately allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions, trusting them to understand the separation between the film itself and the contemptible characters contained within. Ultimately, it represents a vehement cry against the racism and bigotry rampant within its first two acts and also holds the belief that someone can unlearn these bizarre beliefs which are usually bored into them by an outside source. If it didn't go the distance it wouldn't have been half as successful, perhaps instead feeling like a weak-chinned exploitation piece, and its tragic conclusion may have lost its impact. 7/10"

selim987,"Jan 17, 2025",10/10,"Everything about this movie is just perfect, except for maybe its length, and that is definitely not because the movie did not have enough time to wrap the story up properly, but rather because everybody would love to keep on watching this masterpiece for a little longer.The cinematography of this movie is definitely worth to be studied. The powerful and beautiful close up shots of Edward Furlong's character Danny that we see every once in a while allow for the viewer to subconsciously analyze how Derek and his ideologies progressively shape who Danny is as a person. There are some scenes in this movie that are so immersive that they are unlike any other seen in other movies, such as the opening scene and the school bathroom scenes. Edward Norton's performance is just so real, and it really is like you're viewing the life and regrets of THE Derek Vinyard as respected by his fellow skinheads, rather than just any other ordinary character played by Edward Norton.Definitely up there with the greats. If any movie deserves to be 10/10, it's this one. If you're ready for a powerful and immersive experience, this is the movie for you."
greenhalgho,"Mar 16, 2018",10/10,"When I first came across the movie American History X it was while I was looking through Edward Nortons films on his profile. Having seen Primal Fear and Fight Club just a few weeks prior to this I was intrigued to see what other roles he could take on. Furthermore, I was a huge fan of Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 and was happily surprised to see him on this cast list as between 1991 and 1998 when this was released, he did not have many major roles.The story is told through switching from present to past and the way it is done is simply outstanding. The flashback scenes are in black and white to firstly make it clear when the time period is and arguably also to show the darkness that was consuming Edward Nortons character when following the neo-nazi way of life that he did for so long. Edward Norton himself also adds to this effect and his performance makes it seem like he is playing two separate characters. His brother in the movie 'Danny' is played by Edward Furlong who gives a very gripping performance as we see his character change his ways completely in front of our eyes. The time period of only one day also adds the severity of this change and in a very powerful way shows the effect of influence that one person can have on another.For people that haven't seen this movie it is without a doubt one of the most powerful movies I have personally seen and one that I believe everyone should watch. Because of this, I have not given away many details of the movie and I believe that words cannot convey the true message that this 'masterpiece' conveys.10/10. Cinematic Brilliance"

So, I saw the film once again.
But again, it wasn't enough.
And that's why I saw the film three times at the same day.
The truth is that I've seen this film 9 times. And I'm convinced that there will be a 10th time cause this film creats you so many contradictory feelings at 120 minutes.
It's a masterpiece that manages to describe social and political problematic situations without taking a position. The viewer is free to decide If the heroes (or the anti-heroes) are right or wrong. Or maybe this dipole between right or wrong doesn't even exist.
Cause in the end, the heroes are just... humans."

karagoraymond,"Mar 18, 2015",8/10,"Hands down the most disturbing film I have ever seen. American History X is simply outstanding.One of the film's great strengths is the great all round performance by the cast. Empire Magazine claimed that Edward Norton did not win an Oscar for his performance one of the greatest Oscar injustices of all time. And I completely agree. Some of Norton's racist monologues were so convincing they bordered on being scary. The rest of the cast did great as well. I do think, however, that they could have selected a better actor to play the younger brother, Danny, but that is a nit pick, the actor in the film did fine but I just think someone could have given a more compelling dramatic performance.Overall, what I loved most about the film was the fact that it shows racism for what it is, something that is taught, how naïve people can be led to believe anything if their circumstances call for it. The disturbing scenes where very disturbing and encapsulated the sheer lack of humanity that comes with such racist cults, such as, in this case, the Neo-Nazi's. Ultimately, American History X is not for the squeamish but it is one of the best films I have ever seen."
pilotbest,"Mar 31, 2020",10/10,But for those who can be educated.Isn't it sad that 18 years after this movie was made one of these became the president of the US. :-(
charbelelaro,"Sep 5, 2017",10/10,"Let me begin by saying, this was not an easy film to watch. It was highly confronting surrounding aspects of racism in American society, as well as the unspeakable reality of prison. Although this is exactly what made this film great. I have not seen a film be this courageous in tackling issues that occur in society. Issues that people would rather be oblivious to, are completely exposed in this film. A large number of people steer away from films like this, and prefer to watch meaningless, poorly made films, as its an easy watch. And to a certain extent, light hearted movies are perfectly enjoyable. But ""American History X"" is the true purpose of film. As to why it is, can be described through various elements which make up and form this masterpiece.The first element is the cast. 'Edward Norton', as Derek was incredible, to say the least. His character possessed so much depth, which was slowly revealed to the audience as the film went on. He progressed and behaved so realistically, I no longer saw an actor playing a character. Furthermore, the casting of his entire family was perfect, in particular his younger brother Daniel played by 'Edward Furlong'. He portrayed a troubled teenage kid in the most realistic way. At times I was trying to pick flaws with aspects of his character that weren't as refined or polished, only to realise that these imperfections are true characteristics of any average kid. The history teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, played by 'Avery Brooks, also did a spectacular job, in trying to solve the complicated situation.The second element is the screenplay. This is how a screenplay should be written. Take a simple story-line, and execute it in the most complex way possible. This screenplay takes you on a journey, by firstly showing the situation at hand as a uninformed outsider, but then slowly gives you context and background as the film progresses. This was done so coherently with brilliant flashbacks, which by the end of the film, made you look at each character in an entirely new light. This was what made the film so engaging. The fact that I was curious to see what events shaped these characters, made the flashbacks feel very much anticipated. Also the dialogue between characters was sharp and gripping, especially in scenes where opposing ideas and opinions were battling against each other. It really built the intensity and tension in the film.The final element is the cinematography. The camera movement, and editing was exceptional. The way in which flashbacks were presented in black and white, gave past events much more power and intensity. I particularly liked the way in which there was a constant focus on water. The slow motion shots of dripping water in the shower, made you really feel the exhaustion and fatigue felt by the characters.Overall, the general reason as to why 'American History X' is the purpose of film, is due to the fact that it exposes its audience to confronting aspects of our world. It is able to inform people who may live sheltered lives, much like myself, about the racism and violence, which is a constant reality for many till this day. This film provides its audience with a wider view of the world, contributing to our worldly knowledge and awareness. This is all achieved due to the perfect execution of the elements in the film, discussed above, which all assist in making this film a true masterpiece."
boobthepunk,"Jan 30, 2004",N/A,This film is one of the all time greats. From the very beginning you are captivated with a variety of non conformist yet valid points about racial equality and vengence.

bettyharrishiggins,"Nov 14, 2021",9/10,"Hate to start a review using the race card with overly used catch phrases as ""As a women of Color"", But I will make an exception here because I feel that my point of view is important here.I saw this in the theater when it was released in NYC, sitting in the back of the theater. There where just a few people; six skinheads in the front, a few professor types and father and son.When the scene where Edward Norton gives the young black intruder a deadly curbie, we all recoiled in shared horror at the brutal ugliness of it all.When the Edward Norton character was violently gang raped in the shower we collectively winced. His friendship and change of heart that happens left us all with a collective sigh of relief.When we all left the theater we smiled at each other and slowly talked, sociology professors, skinheads, a black father and son and me. We all agreed that this movie was very important, broke down a racial barrier that I see as breaking down. If only the mainstream news would see that the racial barriers where dissipating until the media stuck its noise in with all their critical race theory. Yes CRT is real.What I'm saying here is when left alone all races get along. Its a humanity thing. And I'm sure if there was a news camera inside the theater egging the naturally diverse theater goers into a ""Us VS Them"" scenario, then yah that would have been a newsworthy man made situation. But it wasn't. I never talked to a skinhead before and what I learned through this movie and because of that night, that we are all the same."

ozymandius1024,"Jan 18, 2004",9/10,"I think that a lot of people give this movie good praise for all of the wrong reasons.  Most enjoy the violence that the movie displays (mostly the ""curb stomping"" scene), but fail to see the actual moral that the story has (which is extremely clear).  Edward Norton's character develops excellently throughout the film, and Edward Furlong's character is likeable too.  It paces itself well, and there really aren't any bad spots in the film, it feels like everything should be there.  All in all, one of the best and most powerful movies I've ever seen, with one of the most melancholy endings to boot."

This movie touches upon some really sensitive issues..its one of the best I've seen..right from the acting to the storyline. Edward Norton is a brilliant actor..and i believe that this is his best performance. 10/10..all the way!! Watch this movie with an open mind..and it'll definitely make you feel a lot differently about some issues. No wonder this movie is in the top 50 of all time.The dialog's are great and the movie manages to stay away from the trap of being too violent (credit to the director for that)
imdbfan-2189324654,"Mar 29, 2025",10/10,"American History X is a deeply impactful film that left me speechless. Edward Norton delivers a phenomenal performance as Derek, whose transformation is both shocking and moving. The film brutally exposes the cycle of hatred and its devastating consequences, especially through the relationship between Derek and his younger brother Danny. The black-and-white flashbacks enhance the emotional weight of key moments, making the storytelling even more immersive. The ending hit me hard, emphasizing the inescapable nature of violence in a world consumed by hatred. A powerful, thought-provoking masterpiece that lingers long after the credits roll."
sudhakaranakhilan,"Apr 26, 2020",7/10,"This title, Black and White politics has two dimensions in its context. The first one simply points out the racist drawings about the Black and white people in America and the second one recalls us that the Black & white period were people who seem to be colorless. American History X is none other than that. The subject is so strong and it has its world appeal. It looks familiar not only in America but also in the entire world. Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part. In the end, there comes another beginning of the circle where he carries his brother's shot dead body. The politics is just between black and white similarly it was the politics in between right and wrong."
CineCritic2517,"Nov 9, 2009",1/10,"What an irritatingly simplistic and utterly unbelievable film this was.From the first to the last scene I was just amazed at how unnatural the scenario unfolded and how jaw-droppingly convenient every plot turn was laid out the viewer to mercifully accept. I just don't understand what people find entertaining about this sort of movie. The social commentary was laughable and at best lacking, the score obnoxiously present and far too much actors overacted to the point of it being a parody.All it takes is one preachy racist lecture from dad at the breakfast table to make a seemingly intelligent young man a skinhead...what? Even the average daytime soap creates a better backdrop than this. Blacks simply giving up their turf over a lost game of hoops? On what true story on what planet was this movie based again? *Ugh*This movie could have been made by Ikea; during construction everything is completely spelled out for you, but that which should be holding it together is randomly missing.3.5 / 10"
daoldiges,"Feb 11, 2022",8/10,"Ed Norton gives a really solid performance here, and is well supported by a fully capable cast. The story itself isn't necessarily new but this telling of it is fresh. A lot of heavy topics covered here in a raw and unvarnished way makes for compelling viewing all the way. Not always easy to watch but definitely worth checking out."
ahmadsmalik7,"Apr 7, 2025",10/10,"Extending far beyond the stereotypical boundaries of one specific genre, American History X leaves far more behind than just its legacy in cinema. It bravely ventures into the racial biases of suburban America in the late 90s, and how these tensions eventually bubble onto the surface, transforming into an all-consuming hatred, depicting the roots of extremism and prejudice in the most most transparent and authentic manner. It's horrifying, brutally honest, painful and traumatising throughout its runtime, and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer's mind. Despite this, it doesn't advocate for racial harmony as a utopian fantasy neither does it absolve any particular group from the allegations put forward - it just asks the right questions. Interestingly enough, its arguments aren't limited to the US but apply to racism across the globe. From a cinematic point of view, it is flawless and leaves nothing unsaid whilst maintaining an air of fear, mystery and anger. Edward Norton gives the performance of his life by his portrayal of an incredibly dynamic, complex and impactful character, showing us all why he is arguably one of the best actors of this generation. A perfect film in every way."

guyg-57,"Jul 28, 2025",10/10,"This is the most underrated film of all time.Great storytelling of a changing man facing the consequences of his past actions, which he made bacause of his belief in an idiology, that effects his loved ones. Emotional, and could for sure change people's prespective on some aspects in life. And the acting is just the cherry on the top.I just don't understand how people don't talk about this movie like they talk about movies like fight club and rhe shawshnek redemption. It's absured in my opinion, but it's not just me right?"
chera_khalid,"Sep 25, 2023",9/10,"""American History X"" is an unflinching exploration of hatred, redemption, and the power of change, earning an emphatic 9/10 rating from me. I absolutely loved every aspect of this film. Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard is nothing short of astonishing, conveying the complexity of his character's journey from bigotry to enlightenment. The film editing masterfully weaves together past and present, enhancing the narrative's impact. Its strength lies in its unapologetic message about the destructive nature of racism and the possibility of transformation. The music is hauntingly evocative, underscoring the emotional depth of the story, while the cinematography captures the stark contrast of Venice Beach's sun-soaked streets and the darkness of hatred. ""American History X"" is a brutal but necessary reflection on the enduring scars of racism, and my love for it is as profound as the film's message."
isaacwest-66001,"Feb 25, 2023",6/10,"The movie is very well done by all accounts and delivers the most powerful message on racism ever I have ever seen on screen; it's a story of how racist struggles cuts both ways and will not end with violence, vengeance or hatred, but rather love and forgiveness. I have absolutely no intention of watching this movie again nor did I really enjoy watching it, yet it is a movie that everyone should consider, and maybe even needs to see. I put it in the same category of Fight Club for that matter, a movie not intending to have a fun, feel-good message but one intended to deliver and powerful commentary on daily life."
raquelbuinho-56922,"Aug 31, 2021",10/10,"A tale of intergenerational racism and all it brings upon those who fall in line with a hideous ideology.Edward Norton's performance gives this hard-hitting drama crucial weight.Powerful, brutal, and takes proper aim at white supremacy."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Apr 10, 2023",7/10,"Now, the 1998 movie ""American History X"" from writer David McKenna and director Tony Kaye is a very hard-hitting movie that is a must-watch movie actually. I remember watching the movie back when it was just released and the impact it had on me back then.The storyline in the movie, as written by David McKenna, really is a well-written one. It is a script that is not only story-driven, but most certainly also very much character-driven. And the characters in the movie are well-fleshed out and detailed, adding a lot of layers to the movie.And the cast ensemble in the movie was good. With the likes of Edward Norton in the leading role, and carrying the movie phenomenally, I might add, then you're in capable hands for 119 minutes. The movie also have good performances from the likes of Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, Stacy Keach and most definitely also from Elliott Gould.What makes ""American History X"" such a powerhouse of a movie is the story, and how well it translates into aspects of society even today. But also the great acting performances in bringing the characters to life on the screen.""American History X"" can be a visually tough movie for certain viewers, and thus it is a not a movie that is just for anyone. But I do firmly believe that director Tony Kaye's 1998 movie is one that must and should be watched. If you haven't already seen it, and have the chance to do so, you should and you must watch it.It is also a movie that can be seen more than once with some years in between each viewing. But that is a testimony to the writing of David McKenna and the contents of the script and storyline.My rating of ""American History X"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."
xmdbx,"Nov 19, 2019",3/10,"This movie is seriously flawed. Like everything about it is flawed. The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting. I don't think Norton did anything special and nobody else was good."
Silitonga,"Nov 9, 2013",8/10,"One of the best movie in 1998 and definitely the best performance from Edward Norton. Absolutely brilliant acting. After his nerd memorable character in ""Fight Club"", I guess everybody would never across their mind that Edward Norton will be able to play a rough skinhead post Nazi. Well, he is a cute little guy that look like innocent and untouchable.Well, It's called life transformation. And Edward Norton done it very well.So was here, in ""American History X"". His character's life transformation (Derek Vinyard) really catching every breath. He played it very well. One of the best part when He argue with his father about his Neo Nazi ideology. Almost, I gold my breath as long as it takes.Prison definitely taught him so much good things. And his turn out life begins. But, as a ex-con, many people want to try to recruit him again. But, he's wisely said no and back to his family.But, the last scene really tragedy that none of people can control. Life lesson sometimes hard and sometimes we have to pay price what we had done. But, apart of it, there are always ways to apologize."
arthur_tafero,"Nov 16, 2018",9/10,"This snapshot of Venice, California, a racially tense seaside city, is both accurate and frightening. The irrational response of a repressed middle class white family to the indifference of an overly permissive government that allowed American tax dollars to be spent on undocumented immigrants is highlighted in a speech within the film.Aside from the political aspect, the pure visceral energy of the film's violence and frustration from all races comes directly to the consciousness of the viewer. All forms of extremism are shown to be self-defeating. A bravura performance by both Ed Norton and Ed Furlong. An American classic."
joseph_sellings,"Mar 1, 2014",9/10,"American History X is one of the most powerful films that has been to cinema. The storyline is about a nazi skinhead, who tries and saves his brother from a life of destruction and joining up with a nazi group. This happens everywhere, and for the story to be brought to life from our education and entertainment was outstanding. Edward Norton plays such a critical role, and is so believable as the characters its scary. An excellent production, turns so many heads as the gripping and brutal truth comes out about how some people think and act. This film is truly a great one, and extremely pleasing. The direction is fantastic, and acting is second to none, because its so gritty there are no over dramatics. American History X is a classic, it is a must watch."
ivarzachrisson,"Mar 1, 2021",10/10,One of the best dramas ever made(Edward Norton best acting performance)
avensou,"Jun 19, 2025",8/10,"One of the best films about neo-Nazis, which greatly influenced my worldview. The film is very instructive, all the problems of neo-Nazism and racism are perfectly shown, all the consequences and all the evil that is in it, why it is worth renouncing it and better not to join it at all.The acting of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong is top notch, they revealed their characters, their nature, feelings and activities in the best possible way.An interesting camera technique is used, alternating between color and black and white film depending on the time, the same as was used later in the filming of Better Call Saul.The ending is good, but the backstory is not the best. This movie really touched my heart, such heavy movies leave a mark in your memories, this is something everyone should see."
ameenpi,"Jul 13, 2012",10/10,"awesome movie American history x = fight club + crash + shawshank redumption.well this is really nice film.It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers. This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him..."
ajaybittu-59260,"Dec 12, 2019",7/10,"This movie is very emotional nd based on true scenario. if you hate some body just beacuse of they are different to you, you will get same hate as gift. everybody is equal on this planet. we all r brothers nd sisters. so keep loving not hating. 7.5 out of 10."
markvanwasbeek,"Aug 10, 2024",9/10,"I remember being 13 wanting to rent this movie at the videostore. I had to go back and get a permission slip from my mom or the guy wouldn't rent it to me. After I watched it as a 13-year old, I kinda understood. I'm 39 now and watched it again yesterday (although I still have it on dvd somewhere). I understand it better now.This movie is top 5 best movies for me. Edward Norton gives his best performance, better than all the movies he did later. The casting overall is superb. On an emotional level it hits harder now though.Maybe because nothing has changed. Still the same rhetoric, still the same problems. Or maybe I'm more empathetic this age. Maybe it's a midlife crisis who knows.Point being, this movie still very much holds up after 26 years, aged like fine wine even.This is a must-see for anyone who has teens and you should let them watch it too. Or anyone without teens for that matter. Like Requiem for a dream it should be standard for everyone. It's a relic of the 90s. 9.5/10."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 25, 2025",6/10,"""American History X"" is an incredibly powerful film that left me speechless. The story of Derek Vinyard's journey from a hateful neo-Nazi to a man seeking redemption is both heartbreaking and hopeful. Edward Norton's performance is a masterclass in acting; his portrayal of Derek is so raw and intense that you can't help but be completely engrossed.The use of black and white for the flashbacks was a brilliant creative choice, making the past feel stark and distant from the vibrant, complex present. The film doesn't shy away from difficult topics, instead, it confronts them head-on, forcing you to think about the roots of hate and the possibility of change. It's a truly unforgettable cinematic experience that will stick with you long after the credits roll.Is it worth watching? Yes, it's absolutely worth watching. It's a powerful and disturbing film, but it's an important one that deals with serious themes like racism, hate, and redemption. It's considered a modern classic for a reason."
r-48240,"Apr 2, 2020",2/10,"Disappointment, the plot is too unconvincing, whether it's Derek or Dan, it's too easy to change your mind, fold a bed sheet or listen to a story, and then you'll go back to normal?! Preaching means a lot and it doesn't have much depth. Except for a few slow motion scenes and Norton's acting skills, there's nothing I'm satisfied with"
mvp0207,"Apr 7, 2007",9/10,"A modern classic. This movie plays an important role in American cinematography. It exams the hate that is bread in America's middle class, white community. Not only does it show why American youth become so angry, but it also looks into the people that exploit it. Its a story about change, about changing ones mind and most importantly about family. It pears into the power of peer pressure and how the force to conform can conquer relationships. The movie exams the fact that although one can change for the better, at some point your past mistakes will catch up with you. Karma 101. The movie moves at a medium clip and at some points can slow down but all and all it's one of the best."
fembot1005,"Mar 18, 2014",9/10,"First off the most obvious thing about this movie that makes it so great is the acting, and I don't mean just Edward Norton I mean the entire cast. The girl from Charmed (the movie) and The Water Boy is really great though I can never remember her name. The leader of the racists, the fat racist guy (also the friend in My Name is Earl I'm pretty sure), Elliott Gould, the mom and even the little brother (and teen aged and child actors are usually awful to me). The cast of this movie is really great and make it so believable.That said obviously Edward Norton is the heart of this film. He is really awesome in this movie and gets the audience to both loathe how horrible he is but also sympathize and pity him and the life he has led and want him to earn redemption.I don't want to give away the ending but the movie is a great drama with a fantastic climax and Norton deserved the Oscar for his portrayal without a doubt!"
harrylosborne,"Jun 7, 2019",7/10,"Highly regarded and seen as one of Edward Norton's most prominent roles to date, American History X is a dark retelling of racial tensions and Nazism in modern America, highlighting the unending vicious circle of conflict. Personally, Norton is leant heavily on to bring this film to life: the concept is without a doubt interesting, but doesn't go deep enough to really highlight the beliefs and thoughts of those so opposed to other belief systems and races.The story is self-explanatory enough: following a stint in prison, Derek Vinyard (Norton) tries to distance himself from his Nazi past, before realising his younger brother Danny (capably played by Edward Furlong) is already deeply integrated. Flashbacks of Vinyard's past (all shown in black and white) detail parts of his family's history, explaining his journey from one of the most hardened affiliates of the party to a far more self-aware character. Throughout the film he tries his best not to let Danny get sucked in further, but every action has an equally damaging consequence.Infamous for one scene in particular (a failed carjacking upon which a lack portion of the film is based), American History X actually isn't as revolutionary as it has been considered to be. No doubt interesting and somewhat thought provoking, some of the scenes seem gratuitous (both in violence and story-fleshing), fairing to really elevate the film. Norton himself is the gem, but without his stellar outing, it's hard to believe that this controversial film would truly be remembered today."
faornelas,"May 19, 1999",10/10,"American History X is one example of motion picture that can be called cinematographic art! It is absolutely not a film for those who go to the movies just for fun; it is, in fact, for those who see art as an object of reflection about our world, ourselves and our lives. It is a motion picture in which the image says more than a thousand words, concerning a serious and real drama that affects not only the America but the whole world: the prejudice, one of the most irrational attitudes of human kind; proving that some legacies must end. It is even better due to the remarkable performance of Edward Norton as the former neo-nazi skinhead Derek Vinyard. American History X is one of the best motion pictures ever produced concerning the prejudice and one of the most marking movies of all times!"
