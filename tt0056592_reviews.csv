Don-102,"Mar 30, 1999",9/10,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, ""6 and a half feet big"" legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused ""negro"" on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10"
Xstal,"Sep 5, 2022",9/10,"It's a story that's riven with themes, of prejudice, hate, broken dreams, there's courage and caring, there's taunting and daring, growing up, finding out what life means. At its heart you'll find Atticus Finch, defends a man most town folk want to lynch, no evidence in play, to support what they say, but they're adamant and won't move an inch. Scout and Jem watch these awful events, through child's eyes losing their innocence, in a world that's gone mad, it makes you so sad, but there's hope that leaves some recompense. Plus there's Boo, who defies more perceptions, all shrouded in cloaked misconceptions, hidden from view, most people eschew, but a saviour, and a child's revelation.As good as it gets."
HenryHextonEsq,"Dec 15, 1998",9/10,"After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10"
FilmOtaku,"Nov 9, 2003",10/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.  It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times.  The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'.  I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again.  Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons.  Among them, the date that the film was released:  1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's.  It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters.But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero.  At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character.  (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered  mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible.  The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength.  Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind.To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education.  If you have not read it, do so.  If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others.  It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.--Shelly"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sep 4, 2004",10/10,"After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10"
dweck,"Dec 9, 1998",N/A,"Hoo boy, am I a sucker for courtroom dramas. The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing ""Ponette,"" a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in ""Mockingbird"" received my best child performance ever awards. ""Ponette"" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn't diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen ""Mockingbird,"" I pity you. You've passed on one of Hollywood's most unforgettable experiences."
jam5219,"Apr 11, 2002",10/10,"Enough good things can't be said about this movie.  It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made.  No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people.  One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to ""stand up your father is passing"".Gregory Peck has always been one of my favorite actors.  This is definitely one of my favorite roles that he has ever played, and he does an excellent job at it.  Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout.  Although it had a short time on screen, Robert Duvall's portrayal of ""Boo"" Radley was one of his very first roles on screen and what better movie than ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to kick off your acting career.A great movie of all times."
acmilan03c1,"Feb 3, 2006",10/10,"This is why I watch movies. Every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears, because it reminds me that, all bad things aside, there is good in all of us - we just have to help each other search for it and bring it to light.This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. Mary Badham is absolutely wonderful as 'Scout', and I think she deserves just as much credit as Gregory Peck for this picture.The rest of the cast are great as well, and a special mention goes to Elmer Bernstein for his delicate and so appropriate score.I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. 10/10"
bkoganbing,"Jan 27, 2006",10/10,"When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain, but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer, raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grown-up Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film.To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman.It's a thankless task and Finch knows it, because he knows the attitudes of the people there, those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending, James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating, and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film, Captain Newman, MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style.No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test."
andrewroy-04316,"Oct 5, 2020",7/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a tricky adaptation, because as with many great books, it delves deeply into several different topics and themes. Condensing the plot and themes into the shorter timeframe of a movie is always challenging, and while they definitely pull it off successfully here, I do think we see a bit more breadth than depth. They did cut several plot points and scenes which were less essential, which was necessary. Even so, we don't get to know the characters and the nuances of their relationships as much as I would like here. The movie is less about the nuanced characters and themes that the book focuses on and simply tells the compelling story of a murder trial of an innocent black man in old money Alabama. It's still well done and I enjoyed it, but one of my favorite elements of the book was seeing the world from Scout's point of view and understanding her perspective as a precocious young woman in that society. We still get a general sense of her character, but don't see as much about her relationship with Jim and how it evolves, or see much development from her across the film. We do spend plenty of time in the courtroom to understand fully what is happening in the case. It's hard to fault the writers too much, and the safe call is definitely prioritizing storytelling as they did, but as a result no other elements stood out or grabbed me. I did also find that the writing suffered a bit from a problem I also had with the novel: that the story feels a bit segmented, with a few sections that don't flow naturally into each other. Still, these are fairly minor qualms and it is a rock solid adaptation of a good story."
elliexphant,"May 11, 2005",10/10,"'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but this film does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn't necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see."
EthanBJones_03,"Oct 25, 2017",7/10,"​'TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD' - 1962Directed by Robert MulliganStarring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Phillip AlfordPlot Overview: ​Scout Finch (Mary Badham), 6,and her older brother, Jem (Phillip Alford), live in sleepy Maycomb, Ala., spending much of their time with their friend Dill (John Megna) and spying on their reclusive and mysterious neighbour, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall). When Atticus (Gregory Peck), their widowed father and a respected lawyer, defends a black man named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against fabricated rape charges, the trial and tangent events expose the children to evils of racism and stereotyping.This might be a movie that I am just not understanding in the slightest. It may genuinely be a testament of cinematic perfection. But, as it stands, I was immensely disappointed by this movie. Is it a poor movie? No. Not at all. In fact, there is a portion of this movie that could stand as one of the greatest 'Acts' in Film history. But the meat surrounding this Act was very lacklustre and poor for me. I am very sad to say that 'To Kill A Mockingbird' disappointed me.But what do I actually like about it? The portion between the first half and last 20 minutes was cinematic perfection. I am serious. I won't specifically say what happens but I will say that it is literally perfect. As for the film surrounding that part, that is a different story for me, but that does not detract from the masterful film making shown my the actors and Mulligan during that sweet, sweet 40 or so minutes.I also loved Gregory Peck in this film. He delivers a heartfelt, slow and meaningful performance as Articus. You can really see a passion and intelligence lurking beneath his calm, steady and articulate demeanour. Peck well and truly deserved his Oscar for this outstanding performance.Brock Peters was also incredible in his, unfortunately, minute role as Tom Robinson. Peters and the writers do excellent jobs in creating sympathy for this character and truly showing the injustice of the situation he finds himself in. I was very disappointed that he did not at least receive an Oscar nomination for this role; it was truly excellent.Phillip Aldford was good as Jem. The character wasn't exactly likable or interesting but I do admire their attempt at giving him an arc. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Mary Badham's Scout for me. It baffles me as to how she earned an Oscar Nomination because I found her performance to be bland and very poor. And Scout as a character was also very disappointing. I mean, she wasn't likable, interesting and I fail to see a true arc for her.Another flaw that I have with this film is the very mediocre beginning and end. The middle is, as stated prior, true cinematic gold. The remainder of the film is a dull, bland, uninteresting, monotonous mess. I fail to see the brilliance in it and, while the message of the film is strong and prosperous, the execution of it was not.Then there is the very annoying ending. Maybe I am an idiot but I did not understand what was happening in the ending of this film. It was very confusing. I understand WHAT happened but I cannot fathom as to why. Perhaps my attention merely lapsed for those precious couple of seconds for the grand reveal but that doesn't change my distaste for it. That, and that man was absurdly creepy.In conclusion, I was unfortunately disappointed by 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. It's not a bad movie by any means, and when it gets it right, it gets it right. But the overall package did not live up to the expectations I had. It was a little over average and the middle on its own would achieve an easy 10/10. Despite that claim, the middle was the middle, and it had the beginning and end bogging it down. Do see this film, though. The message is very important and it features an impeccable middle and performance from Gregory Peck. Aside from that though, it was not that great. I'll rate 'To Kill A Mockingbird' 7 'Creepy Men in the Corner' out of 10."
castricv,"Mar 30, 2002",4/10,"Before I start my explanation of the above statements, I would like to comment that I am an avid Gregory Peck fan and I have also found his work to be of exceptional quality. This movie is no exception. I have also read Harper Lee's novel of the same name and found it to succeed in every area and every issue that it was trying to portray. Unfortunately, this success did not transfer to film, even with Mr. Peck and a cast of exceptionally talented child-actors. Every aspect of the film, with the exception of Mr. Peck and the children, is lacking, misguided, and often tries to pull at the heartstrings of early 1960's viewers with lame set-ups and other devices used to show one side and one man as being absolutely unerring and without vice. The movie takes a while to develop and for the first half-hour focuses primarily on the children. The children do rather everyday things and converse with each other about nothing of consequence on the film. They finally decide to explore a ""haunted house"" to see the ""maniac"" that lives within it. While I felt that this avenue might lead somewhere, nothing of any consequence, albeit a small meeting with the maniac at the end of the film, came of this rather long and drawn out plot line. Next, we see that Mr. Peck, who portrays a compassionate, strong father and lawyer, is assigned to defend a black man who has supposedly committed a rape of a white female. Subsequent to this, there is never any conversation among Peck and the defendant, no evidence discussed prior to trial, and no real character development of the defendant and even to a larger extent Mr. Peck. We then see a few scattered scenes of the ultra-racist and completely ignorant father-of-the-victim, who tries his best to cause trouble and say dirty things to black people. Though he is shown as mean and stupid, he doesn't do anything particularly characteristic of an enraged racist father, he merely calls Mr. Peck a ""ni$%er lover "" and spits a lot. You will notice that he is not even with the angry mob that tells Mr. Peck to hand over the prisoner so that they can lynch him. Finally, we arrive at a trial, where it is unbelievable that this case would have even gone to trial based on certain obvious fact that you will see in the movie. In trying to say any more directly involving the film's plot, I would be spoiling the movie for you, but suffice it to say, if Mr. Peck were not in this film and did not give such a rousing courtroom speech, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. The direction is poor and uneven, plot tangents go untouched or under-developed, and many of the characters and actors seem rather silly. Instead of achieving what the book did in terms of portraying racism in the Depression South and the intriguing stories of the children, the film manages to seem poorly done, even cheap, and the child actors's obvious talents go to waste on dead end plot lines. Even the costuming seems badly done. You will notice that all of the whites wear overalls, while the ""enlightened"" Mr. Peck and a handful of kind blacks wear suits. In closing instead of being a thoughtful and poignant depiction of racism in the South, it seems contrived. My recommendation is to avoid this unless you are an avid Gregory Peck fan and read the novel. But if you really want to watch a movie close to this subject that is done well, try In the Heat of the Night or any number of Sidney Portier's films. 4/10"
Pickwick12,"Apr 5, 2004",N/A,"Generally, I prefer to review movies I dislike, because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones, but ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen.  I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.The best thing about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child's eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it."
shan_seehar-1,"Mar 7, 2005",10/10,"Very rarely, it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeals and significant life lessons in a style only of the kind of their own that, we can't expect even. This fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. It's not just a movie or even just a promising story in general, but all it portray's is ""Innocence"". A girl's recollection of her childhood days which are still at their full bloom in her mind, depicting the innocence of juvenile as well as as adult minds, a period where mostly immature minds become curious to the racial bigotry and sometimes mature minds become its prey and a time when harsh realities of life like intolerance, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society gradually dawn upon them.Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck ) is an absolutely Gentleman Lawyer whose wife has passed away and he has a son and a daughter. A Black man Tom Robinson is wrongly alleged of raping a poor white woman. In fact, he a victim of white woman's effort to hide her guilt by targeting his innocence and utilizing favors of racial attitude of unsocial society towards Negros. Finch decides to defend him on his principles realizing that the narrow minded society will turn against him and so it happened and townspeople started making his life agonizing. The whole story is masterfully out shined by the ingenuousness, purity and innocence of his children with with a unique inspirational interaction with their father.Boo Readly who lives in the town is mentally retarded and is sidelined by the society. He is a mark of fear and curiosity for children because he is different from others. But he is the one who marks the ultimate climax of this emotionally crafted masterpiece.It's a must see movie for all ages in all times because it gives many priceless emotional and touching lessons for those who are sincere and perceptive.A Remarkably Simple and Simply Remarkanble Masterpiece!!!"
mmr820,"Feb 3, 2001",10/10,"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is truly a much loved and critically-acclaimed film. It is a perfect portrayal of childhood innocence, racial prejudice, moral tolerance and courage. No other words can describe this film except marvellous.

Fella_shibby,"Feb 9, 2016",10/10,"I first saw this in the early 90s.Revisited it on a dvd which I own in 2009 with my kids. My 6 year old boy n 5 year old daughter was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children.Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery.My daughter kinda got scared of the character Boo.I remember she asked me to buy for her bib overalls/dungarees aft enjoying this movie.Revisited again few days back n now my kids are 13 n 12 respectively.Felt like writing a review now inspite of knowing that everything has already been said about this wonderful movie.This is one of the greatest movies of all time, indeed n one of my personal fav.The character Atticus Finch is indeed the greatest screen hero of the 20th century.The child actors are excellent and the young Mary Badham as Scout is remarkable.Mulligan's direction is flawless. Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert are brilliant. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties.Excellent cinematography by Russel Harlan. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly and one of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein.Gregory Peck's best performance in my opinion.(Edited n inserted this line aft re watching it again in Nov 2021 n now my kids are 17 n 18 respectively).This movie n the story is indeed timeless classic."
chiragrathod09,"Aug 10, 2024",10/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is more than just a film; it's a profound exploration of racial injustice, morality, and the innocence of childhood. Set in the heart of the American South during the Great Depression, the film masterfully captures the complexities of a society grappling with its darkest demons.Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is nothing short of iconic. His character stands as a towering figure of integrity, courage, and compassion. Atticus' unwavering defense of Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of a crime, in the face of overwhelming prejudice is a testament to his moral fortitude. Peck's performance is nuanced and understated, making Atticus a truly relatable and inspiring character.The story is primarily seen through the eyes of young Scout Finch, played with precocious charm by Mary Badham. Her innocent perspective offers a poignant contrast to the harsh realities of the adult world. The film beautifully captures the wonder, curiosity, and gradual awakening to the complexities of human nature experienced by children.The trial sequence is a masterclass in tension and suspense. Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus is nothing short of iconic, his quiet dignity a powerful counterpoint to the hysteria of the courtroom. Yet, the outcome is a stark reminder of the insurmountable odds faced by Black people in the Jim Crow South.The film's true tragedy unfolds in its final act. The senseless murder of Bob Ewell, while seemingly a victory for justice, is a complex and morally ambiguous event. The revelation that Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse, is the one who saved the Finch children is both shocking and poignant. It's a testament to the darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of a seemingly quiet town.To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful indictment of racial prejudice and the destructive force of hatred. The film's exploration of themes such as empathy, justice, and the importance of standing up for what is right remains as relevant today as it was when it was released. It is a film that challenges viewers to examine their own biases and to strive for a more just and equitable society.Director Robert Mulligan's sensitive and understated direction brings Harper Lee's beloved novel to life with stunning visual beauty and emotional depth. The film's cinematography captures the essence of the Deep South, creating a rich and atmospheric backdrop for the story.To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. It is a film that inspires, challenges, and ultimately leaves an enduring impact on the human spirit. It is essential viewing for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of race, justice, and the human condition."
little_biker_girl,"Dec 6, 2005",10/10,"About ten years ago, a year or so after I was married, I became quite ill and was bed-ridden for almost two weeks. I was in so much pain I could not sit on the sofa and look at television; my eyes hurt so badly from my fever that I couldn't even lie in bed and read. It was Christmas season and my husband, working in retail, worked extra long hours. With no way to entertain myself or even to sleep, the long hours spent alone were almost unbearable. Then I had an idea: I had seen that our public library had books on tape. I asked my husband if he would find something interesting for me, not having any idea what sort of ""books"" they might have. He chose To Kill a Mockingbird.I had, of course, always heard of the book but apparently it was not on our required reading list in high school. Remembering how I had loathed so many of the books I was forced to read in school, I had mixed feelings when he brought it to me. Still, I welcomed ANY distraction to help pass the time. What an absolutely wonderful book it turned out to be. (If my memory is correct, it was read by Meryl Streep. What a beautiful job she did of it!) Looking back at it now, I'm glad I got so sick that winter, or I might not have had the opportunity to ""read"" it. What a comfort it was to me during a painful, difficult time.A few years later I ran across the movie on television. I was so very pleased to see how well they translated it to film. No film ever captures EVERY facet of a book (or we'd have an awful lot of eight hour films out there!) but the book was definitely given justice. Having grown up in the deep south myself, even having myself attended segregated school and seen INTENSE prejudice amongst the privileged white upper-class, I applaud the book's writer and the film's producer all the more for producing such works during a time of indescribable social struggle and upheaval.To Kill a Mockingbird is a strong, quiet film of great dignity... qualities that are sadly lacking in almost every film made in this country today. To me though, having first come across the book in the isolation of of sickness, listening to it hour after hour in the dim light of my bedroom, watching the grey winter clouds pass by the window as I listened, it will alway be my own special, personal film."
peelboy1000,"Oct 12, 2014",6/10,"Now i think this is a very good movie and a very good book. But just looking at the IMDb rating and the reviews, this movie is clearly overrated. I've read the book about 4 times and have seen the movie twice. Some very good things about the movie was adapting the book. It was very well adapted and stuck very true to the book. Gregory Peck did a great job as Atticus. Also Brock Peters did a very good job as Tom Robinson. Most people perform pretty well. That's not why this film is overrated. The movie when looking at it close is pretty bland. I mean the movie itself isn't that great. The movie can be slow at points, not all the characters were good (Dill and Mayella). The ending was different then the book and i liked the book ending much better. And overall the movie just didn't have anything special to offer. To sum it up perfectly. Its a good book adaptation movie (for the most part) with nothing great to offer and nothing bad either. I like it, it just doesn't deserve the praise it gets."
SnoopyStyle,"Feb 22, 2014",10/10,"Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Scout (Mary Badham) is a 6 year old girl living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. It's a tired old town life with his lawyer father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his little brother Jem. Then Atticus takes a case to defend a black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white teen girl Mayella Ewell. It sends the town into a frenzy which only Atticus and the innocence of Scout are able to withstand.It's an American classic. Gregory Peck exudes stature, compassion and dignity. It takes an important book and honors it with an impressive film. The trick of the movie is to look at the issue of race through the eyes of Scout. It also features Robert Duvall as the iconic Boo Radley. There is one point in the movie after the trial is over that always gets me. As Atticus walks out of the courtroom, all the black folks in the balcony stand up. Reverend Sykes tells Scout to stand. ""Miss Jean Louise. Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing."" There is something so poignant and so overwhelming about that moment."
kenjha,"May 12, 2006",6/10,"This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting. The focus shifts to the rape trial for a while and then its back to the children and a weird neighbor (Duvall), who seems to be from another movie. The film is poorly constructed, lacking focus. Peck is good as Finch, who is portrayed as a decent fellow but certainly not the greatest hero in American cinema as AFI would have us believe. Considering its reputation, a very disappointing film."
mdixon,"Dec 8, 2010",5/10,"I got on a kick of watching two things recently: 1) good courtroom dramas and/or 2) classics. imo this is neither.maybe way back in olden times this movie was something special but all I kept thinking was ""why are these kids in every scene?"" and ""when do we actually get to the court stuff?"" the former is apparently what the movie is about and the latter came and went before I knew it. I guess I could complain the court drama was too short but in hindsight that was actually a blessing.the afi top-10 all-time court dramas incomprehensibly has this as #1!! are you kidding me?? I mean I'm not a totally unsophisticated person but not only does the court portion come very late in the movie, almost as an afterthought, it was as thrilling as peeling potatoes.see this movie if you must but I hope you know more about why you want to see it than I did.ps anyone that actually was looking for an old-time court drama, ""witness for the prosecution"" was fantastic. quite corny in parts but good drama, very good legal stuff and charles laughton was riveting."
mcardmtbr,"Oct 19, 2004",N/A,"I'm surprised that there aren't more comments on Peck's amazing depiction of Atticus Finch, the father. In this era of absent fathers, preoccupied fathers, abusive fathers, immature fathers, etc, etc, Peck's Finch gives us all a soothing view of the best of fatherhood. Where else do we get to watch a man sit up with his ill child, stand firm in his convictions, show patience and gentleness with his children, demonstrate an appropriate level of humility, communicate righteous values to his children, and give his children a picture of integrity to emulate. Every time I view this film I wonder how Peck was able to pull this off. Every time I view this film, it gives me hope for the future of fatherhood."
bill-25659,"Jun 20, 2020",10/10,"Equal parts heartwarming and heartrending, this is one of the tiny number of films that is hard to overpraise. Deep south depression-era prejudice is filtered clear and uncluttered through the eyes of white children. I watched this again on Juneteenth and its quiet, gentle impact is devastating. Peck is wonderful, of course, but the kids are incredible. Every scene is crafted by Robert Mulligan with creativity and realism. The final 20 minutes flip from harrowing to something that feels like prayer. If you saw this as a kid in 1962, you watched the story unfold with an innocent eye. As a grownup in 2020, and certainly if you have kids of your own, you'll be an emotional wreck halfway through. The film is every bit as satisfying as the book."
daorestes,"Jul 4, 2018",10/10,"First of all, why people don't make this type of film now? Simple story plot but all credit goes to the director. I mean how one can make so simple and sound film? Child actress performed nicely like she is not acting, she is feeling every moment. This movie has no mystery, has no drama but this movie has soundness that will refresh your mind."
Hitchcoc,"Jul 30, 2014",10/10,"There is something so sensitive yet intense in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is a man of great honor and true humanity. He takes it all inside, dealing with the realities of what he is facing. He ignore the threats and sees a man for a man. However, he is doomed but represents an action out of time. I was especially impressed with the children in this movie. They are not scene stealers but rather show the future if allowed to grow up. As the trial moves along, it is obvious that there is little that can be said to counteract the hate that is there. But like most of us, Atticus and look in the mirror at the end of the day and say he did what was right. Gregory Peck was a top ten actor and wandered smoothly from movies such as ""Moby Dick"" to ""The Omen."" He was masterful in psychological thrillers such as ""Spellbound."" This was, however, his finest hour. The man with the rumpled suit and the big heart."
droog57-704-79517,"Apr 13, 2021",10/10,"I first saw this film when I was about 10-12 yrs old. I lived in a predominantly white, large city in Canada and had no exposure at all to people that did not look like me. As a consequence, the only prejudice I saw or mildly experienced was due to national origin and accent.When I first saw this movie I remember weeping over the injustice that was so brilliantly portrayed, and since it was the late 60's I was slightly aware (I was only 12) of the ongoing turmoil in the USA so I believed what was portrayed in the film.From that until this one, I have done my best to follow MLK's dictum, paraphrased, ""content of character regardless of appearance or cultural difference"".I don't give a damn what the woke crowd thinks about this movie, but I would not hesitate to say that over the years it (and the book), has done more to change or to educate the attitudes of white people than almost any other film.How on earth is that a bad thing??"
telegonus,"Jul 19, 2001",7/10,"One hates to be the skunk at the garden party but this movie simply isn't as good as its reputation might suggest. It is extremely dated and calculated in ways that are now obvious but probably worked back in 1962. The dialogue has a tendency to go on for too long in almost every scene, as points are hammered home continuously, didactically, but aside from the scenes that belong only to the children the film is dramatically leaden and top heavy in what were at the time 'dangerous' and 'radical' ideas about racism and injustice (though they were fashionable in Hollywood), and frequently the movie feels like a sermon, and a self-congratulatory one at that.As the story of children growing up in the Deep South during the Depression the film works fairly well. It is beautiful visually and the photography by the underrated Russell Harlan is flawless. The performances of the actors who play the children are superb. Had the movie stuck to being their story it might have been a masterpiece. The part about the elusive, ghostly Boo Radley struck a chord, and I suspect that most of us can remember a spooky neighbor or two and the stories we used to make up about them. So far, so good. But when the black man accused of rape entered the picture a different movie emerged: preachy, obvious, self-consciously genteel about bigotry being the preserve of poor, ignorant rural folks, and above all obvious. This is when it becomes a star vehicle for Gregory Peck, who delivers an extraordinarily self-righteous summation to the jury complete with ""for the love God!"", and I stopped believing what I was watching and I began thinking about some of the shabbier Rod Serling Twilight Zones of long ago, with their 'messages' about 'little people' at the end. The film shifts into high gear in the last act, with the attack on the children, which I still find frightening, but the damage had been done, and even with Boo (blessedly) back in the story the poetic mood of the earlier parts of the movie was recaptured only fitfully, and I had a feeling of having been set-up.Some of the problem with the film is obviously the Harper Lee novel it was adapted from. Miss Lee wrote a good book but as a writer was a far cry from Faulkner or even Eudora Welty, and having reread large portions of it a few years ago I must say that it dates as badly as the movie. She was trying to do too much with her wistful story, and got her politics and poetics mixed up, and the result is an unsatisfactory stab at greatness, though I must say it's a good try. But alas she missed the mark, and so does the film. There's a good deal of sponantaneous feeling in the stuff about the kids, but when it shifts to grown-ups neither Miss Lee, director Robert Mulligan or screenwriter Horton Foote seems to know how to make things work. Suddenly the story turns moral with a vengeance. It's not easy to treat the issue of a man falsely accused of rape any other way, for sure, but it ruins the magical tone so meticulously built up in the earlier scenes. Yes, the world of childhood has as much to do with imagination as reality, and especially with imagination applied to reality as a means of interpretation, which in adults seems the preserve of artists and no one else. The move from childhood to adulthood is often tragic, as life's unpleasantries become unavoidable. Art at its best provides a respite from this as well as another way of seeing life, of feeling things differently and of thinking deeper thoughts. In art we have the opportunity to recapture at least some of the affect of childhood, but to do so with wisdom and understanding.In To Kill a Mockingbird we see a liberal take on childhood, as imagination is tranformed, in the course of the narrative, into a sense of civic responsibility. Children, mockingbirds and black folks are metamorphosed into a kind of helpless class. Only they, it seems, are truly in touch with nature, truth and the meaning of life. The adult whites are either good or bad, interesting only inasmuch as they have all the power and often use it badly. The trick, as the film implies, is to get these blinkered white grownups to appreciate the pure world of freedom and ease that the children, mockingbirds and blacks enjoy, and all will be well, or at least a whole lot better. But alas the reason the white grownups are so dull and moralistic, in good and bad ways, come from their sense of responsibility, which comes with power, and which children, mockingbirds and blacks don't have. When they do get power (viz. Lord Of the Flies) they prove as capable as adults of doing foul, nasty things. I think that Lee, Mulligan and Foote are aware of this contradiction, if only subconsciously, which is why the prevailing mood of the story is one of sadness."
Bernie4444,"Apr 30, 2024",10/10,"I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. The main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and white to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor 'Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor's house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie, many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we know about our neighbors? Watch as the mystery unfolds. Moreover, what will they find out in this slice of life in the Depression-era South?"
HotToastyRag,"Aug 10, 2017",7/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, ""Do you know what a compromise is?"" with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Peck's clipped pronunciation of ""Scout""; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.Unfortunately, there's nothing more American than racism, and in this adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels, lawyer Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Since it's the South, you can only imagine the backlash he and his family receive from the community when he steps up to give Tom Robinson his right to a fair trial. As in the novel, the story is told from the point of view of Scout, Atticus's young daughter. Mary Badham plays Scout, and she's not only adorable, but completely earned her Oscar nomination. She was only ten years old, and the youngest actress to be nominated at that time!To Kill a Mockingbird marks Gregory Peck's most famous role, and while everyone knows the famous ""In the name of God"" powerful courtroom speech, his performance isn't just a ""Gregory Peck role"". He's a caring, concerned father, and the scenes between Greg and Mary are beautiful. Greg won an Oscar for his performance, and the film also picked up statues for Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. Elmer Bernstein's lovely theme was nominated, but it was hard to compete against Laurence of Arabia, which took the music, director, and picture awards away from To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a real American classic, so if you're that one person in the country who hasn't yet seen it, rent it so you can join in the conversation with all your family and friends. Even if you're particularly attached to the novel and don't generally like film adaptations, give it a chance. Harper Lee herself loved the movie and thought Gregory Peck's performance was so wonderful, she gave him her father's (the real Atticus Finch) pocket watch. Peck's grandson is named Harper, which is really sweet, and it shows just how much this role and film meant to him and his family."
gpeelaaron,"Dec 2, 2013",5/10,"Okay i think this was a pretty good movie. I also think it was a good book as well. But seriously this book and movie gets way too much credit. I hate to say this but i didn't like Scout's character in the movie. She was great in the book, but in the movie not so much. The movie seems rushed and kind of boring. Kind of a generic story. The characters were good and accurate to the book (especially Atticus)but Scout was terrible. She was annoying, very hard to understand, and had no emotion at all. This was a good movie but people treat it like it's the best movie ever made. COME ON! Im not saying it was bad, but if i were the director i would have done a better job."
Bored_Dragon,"Mar 12, 2017",10/10,"I do not want to analyze this film. It seems like a desecration. It is enough to say that the American Film Institute declared Atticus Finch the number one on the list of greatest movie heroes of all times, and that Mary Badham was nominated for Oscar for the role of Scout, when she was only 10 years old. This is one of those movies where one watching is enough to remember them for the rest of your life.10/10"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"May 11, 2018",8/10,"'To Kill A Mockingbird (1962)' has held up remarkably well over the years, perhaps most due to its faithful representation of Harper Lee's timeless source novel. It boasts brilliant performances - including surprisingly good turns from the first-time child actors - and beautifully crisp black-and-white cinematography. While the movie isn't quite as successful as the book, as usually is the case, it's still an enjoyable tale that acts as an important and enduring cry against prejudice in all its forms. 8/10"
ajreid,"Nov 17, 2000",10/10,"No better movie has been made about character. I believe most students read the book and watch the movie. That's not good enough. It should be required reading and viewing. The movie stands on its own for Gregory Peck's performance, which is my favorite by any actor, ever. Decency, dignity, and character are three things we all need more in our lives."
taurus-18,"May 15, 2004",N/A,"The film takes my breath away. It's a perfect drama! It is so unpretentious, profound, simple, truthful, and elegant. It is absolutely timeless. It seems to deeply move everyone who watches it. I own this movie and bawl my eyes out every time I see it. But it's a good cry. To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAM, I'll call it) both breaks my heart and inspires me, because it reminds me of human beings' capacity for decency and bravery.Has there ever been a more touching character than Atticus Finch???? Not a perfect man, not a God, but just a person who respected the rights of other people and tried to do the right thing; he was a ""decent"" man. He tried to live his life according to the saying ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Such quiet dignity! I can see why Atticus Finch was recently named the #1 movie ""Hero"" of all time by the American Film Institute. Just thinking about this movie brings tears to my eyes. The only other film to affect me in such a deep way has been The Shawshank Redemption.Gregory Peck would be forever known as Atticus Finch, and he expressed how honored he felt to be associated with such a character. I saw an interesting documentary about Peck's life, and in it he was doing one-man shows around the country. These shows were question-and-answer sessions with the audience, and the majority of questions and comments were related to TKAM and how portraying Atticus Finch had impacted Peck's life. It was so interesting and touching to hear people talk about how the film and that character affected them. I remember one man standing up and saying that TKAM inspired him to become a lawyer, and that he named his son Atticus. I've read here and there about the favorite movies of various celebrities, and have been amazed that of all the movies out there in the world, there's one title that pops up frequently as a favorite - and that's TKAM. And it's the favorite of all kinds of people, both young and old. I almost fell off my chair when I read that it was Madonna's favorite movie. Didn't think she has such good taste! Anyway, how extraordinary it must have been for G. Peck, Robert Duvall and all the other people who were part of TKAM to realize that they created something really, truly impacted people - and could inspire people to try to be better human beings. Wow. Such a legacy!"
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 10, 2010",9/10,"To start with, the book is absolutely wonderful with great characters and a moving story. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
sddavis63,"Aug 19, 2018",9/10,"In my experience, this may be the best adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced, the story having been taken from the novel of the same name by Harper Lee. It's a story about racism in the Depression-era South. It's a coming of age story for young Scout and Jem, who watch their father Atticus doggedly defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young white woman. It features magnificent performances from pretty much the entire cast. Young Mary Badham was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Scout - but then, perhaps surprisingly, she went on to do very little acting. And what can one say about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. This may well have been his best performance; when I think of Gregory Peck it's certainly Atticus Finch who comes into my mind. There's an incredible mix of well known names in the supporting cast: Brock Peters, William Windom, Paul Fix and even a very young Robert Duvall. And there really isn't a weak performance among them. Most of the attention around ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is usually focused on the performances, and especially Peck, but I want to pay special tribute to the directing.Director Robert Mulligan did a superb job as well, and while he went on to direct a number of other movies, this surely was his finest job. There's a very good pace to this movie. It starts out slowly, painting an almost idyllic picture of life in this small town in the South, focusing on Scout and Jem and their friend Dill. It's summer, school is out and they're just kids having fun. It's a casual and carefree existence, they spend most of their time outside, sometimes getting into mischief, sometimes investigating some of the town's mysteries - one of which revolves around the story of Boo, a local boy supposedly kept chained in his basement by his father. You get the feeling that if there was anyplace you wanted to grow up as a child, it was right here in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's - Depression or not. Until Mayella is attacked, and Tom Robinson (a black man) is accused, and Atticus is assigned to defend him. Then the story becomes dark, the racism starts to be seen; the gulf between black and white must be a shock to Scout and Jem, whose exposure to black people to this point has been to friendly Calpurnia, who kept house for their widowed father and looked after them and was more or less part of the family. Mulligan picks up the pace of the movie once the trial starts. The trial proceeds at a frenetic pace - seemingly it all takes place in a single day, which perhaps makes the point that even with Atticus doing his best and making clear the truth of what had actually happened, there was going to be no long consideration of the facts - just a rush to a pre-ordained judgement, followed by a tragedy. Then there's the suspense of what happened to Scout and Jem on their ""longest journey"" - as the adult Scout (who serves as kind of the narrator) calls it in a voice over. But once that finishes, Mulligan changes the pace again, and the story slows down as the mystery of Boo from the beginning of the movie is revealed, and the film concludes on a very gentle and moving note. Just superb pacing from Mulligan. He was nominated for the Oscar as Best Director in 1963, but lost to David Lean's turn directing ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Both were fine movies, but I'd have given the nod to Mulligan.You could criticize the movie for downplaying to an extent the reality of racism. It really doesn't give us any glimpse into what it was like to be black in Maycomb - it gives far more of a white perspective on the issue of racism. But that's exactly what the novel was of course - a depiction of life in small town Alabama using Harper Lee's own upbringing as a model. I also thought that the combination of the depiction of small town life (and especially the focus at the beginning and the end on Boo) was perhaps a bit awkwardly combined with the rape trial and the reflection on racism, although Boo himself becomes an example of yet another misunderstood figure in the town. Atticus comes across as almost too good to be true. But, really, there's very little to criticize about this movie, which deserves to be thought of as a classic. (9/10)"
gracenwilk,"Aug 12, 2004",10/10,"Exiled to Pennsylvania for four years, I read this book to then later watched the film with my children because I saw it as the best gift I could possibly give them from my heritage. TKAM showed a whole generation of southerners how we might live up to our ideals and grow out of our bigotry.This is film making at its unpretentious best- unlike Kane or the Godfather, or Kurosawa, this film isn't about the director or even the actors; it is about a story whose poetry and truth have the power to change people. In that sense it renders powerful testimony to what film making can be. Cleverness and ""genius"" in making films will, at best, only rate an ""8"" from me. This film represents what I think a ""10"" rating should be about.Gregory Peck's performance fits the intent of the film perfectly- quietly dignified and accessible because of his ability to get himself out of the way. Not every book deserves or even affords film makers the luxury of making a movie that so closely reflects the feel of the book, but TKAM is one of those films that understood the book it was based on and the dream of the author who wrote it."
elkabousmehdi,"Jan 11, 2010",7/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful movie, which is based on Harper's Lee novel and it is mainly about ''racial differences"" through the innocence eyes of Atticus's children ''Scout and Jem''.The film is depicted in a simple way which makes it even more interesting in a sense where the problem is showed in a so implicit way.The story occurs in the 1930 in old Maycomb town, ''Scout'' curious and inspirational daughter of the loyal and humble father ''Atticus'', the latter in charge of the defense of the black man Tom Robinson wrongly accused of raping Ewell's white woman.Atticus Finch famous lawyer of the county had to face the curiosity of his children most importantly ''Scout'', she was disturbed by what was happening and it was depicted in a naive way to show us how stupid the problem was, a problem which come from a grey nothingness that is unacceptable and understandable by the children minds and as it is better explained in the novel ''there is something in our world that makes men lose their heads''.Atticus '' Gregory Peck'' amazingly played the role of the lawyer, a white lawyer who's defending a black man against prejudice during an epoch when the black people suffered an incomprehensible discrimination, The court room scene where Atticus is seen so keen to defend and show that ''Tom Robinson'' is not guilty through a meaningful speech in which he pointed out the evidences.Robert Mulligan did a good job to convert the so famous novel into a wonderful movie even though the novel still has some more interesting discussions and actions but still the movie reflected that climate and image the county was in at that time.All in all, the movie panned out to convey to the audience the racial problems that occurred at that time and making it one of the best ''BLACK AND WHITE'' movies of all time.Highly Recommended!!"
christophe92300,"May 26, 2013",3/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird is probably one of the most over evaluated movies of all time.The first hour is absolutely boring to death, endless and in the end pointless. The scenes follow one another very disjointly, with no binder, and it goes nowhere. There is no soul and one is close to a flat electroencephalogram watching these children play, because this is almost exclusively what it is about.Then comes the second part dealing mostly with the trial. This is what kind of saves the movie, and still, even if you get more or less carried away by the testimonies and demonstrations with the underlying themes of racism and segregation, it remains rather weak qualitatively.But what is the most disconcerting is the lack of coherence of the feature with the association of two parts that almost have nothing in common. One is under the impression of watching two completely different movies: chronicle of a childhood or anti-racist pamphlet, a choice should have been made..."
MisterBernstein,"Jun 17, 2004",10/10,"There are two highlights of this film: One is, as could be expected, Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch as the rock of his family, the law, and even the entire Maycomb County. The other is the sharp, focused direction by Robert Mulligan.Hopefully, every movie-lover has seen at least one or two films in which every single camera angle is perfectly done. This film is one of them for anyone who has seen it. The silences and long pauses (almost Ingmar Bergman-esque in their magnitude) accompanied with some of the sharpest b & w photography in American Cinema make this a film that sears its images into your brain.The story, as anyone who has read Harper Lee's novel can say, is both sentimental and powerful. The screenplay by Horton Foote is good, but only as long as it follows Lee's clearly stated boundaries.To Kill a Mockingbird is a film with a brilliant lead performance, sensible, savvy directing which, when mixed with Lee's touching, fulfilling story of American values, is not going to be forgotten for a long time after the initial viewing."
bob the moo,"Mar 23, 2003",N/A,"Told in hindsight by Scout this is the story of how she and her brother remember one summer in the Deep South when their father, Atticus Finch defends a black man (Robinson) who has been accused of forcing himself on a white girl and then beating her.  Atticus finds himself in a battle for the truth in the face of racism and intolerance and also defending his children from the impact of the same on them.I first read the book in school and have re-read it several times as it has really stuck with me. Since then I have seen the film a couple of times but have never felt that it really reaches the same height as the book does. The telling of the story is at it's strongest in the courtroom as it takes on the principles of a courtroom thriller however outside of this central piece it is almost a Southern cliché  with the kids, the community etc.  It still works but it feels like a postcard compared to the reality of the South in the intolerance of the courtroom.The film doesn't totally bring through the themes of the books  instead focusing on the specifics.  This is necessary to make it all fit into the 130min running time but it is to the subject matter's detriment as it loses much of it's significance.  That's not to say it is not impacting, because it still is.  I do have a problem with the first half and the end of the film where the focus is entirely on the children before sudden jumps into the main plot.  In the book it is all part of the same thing, here it does feel like it is a different chapter.Peck is good in his usual moral indignation role and he is well supported by the two child actors who both seem natural  Badham (sister of the director) and Alford.  A very young looking Robert Duvall is in the film briefly and adds a bit of interest to the generally good supporting cast.  It is to the film's credit (considering the period and the setting) that the black characters are not just limited to `yessir' stereotypes although at times they come close.Overall I enjoyed this film and the courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going.  The narration of the grown up Scout is a little weak and some of the film appears to be wandering to no effect but it is still a good film.  I, however, would still rather re-read the book."
LW-08854,"Dec 27, 2023",9/10,"Gripping court drama/ social critique of law, society and discrimination in the USA.The film immerses you in the feel and culture of this southern town in 1930s America. It's seen largely from the innocence of the three young children who haven't been corrupted yet by it's racist culture, their role model and father lead them is charged with defending a young black man but his idealism and slight naivety is shattered by reality. The film perfectly captures hot nights and the evenings of people sat on their porches.The film looks great with it's stark black and white cinematography, the UHD blu ray is a fantastic transfer, this might be the best looking black and white film I've seen. The film is not just court room drama or a tale of bigotry but also includes exploring the poverty of the school mates the children befriend. I know this film gets attacked now for the racial language in it, the passiveness of the black characters and so on but I think it is a tremendously important film that realistically portrays the 1930s and the way it would be seen from the perspective of a little girl still too young to fully realise the significance of certain moments. The performances are simply phenomenal, especially from Gregory Peck."
zkonedog,"Feb 28, 2017",9/10,"When judging a film based on a spectacularly popular novel, there are two things that I usually look for: 1. Does it stick to the compelling themes of the source material reasonably well? I don't need word-for-word and I don't even mind little changes here and there, but it should be faithful to the themes that made the literature iconic. 2. Does it add something unique to the equation? Print literature and film are too entirely different beasts to tame (just ask Stephen King about that!), and one doesn't necessarily (or even usually) translate well into the other. In essence, you can't just expect a movie to be successful because the book was likewise. The film-makers need to make sure the translation is fit for the big screen.On both of those counts, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" receives a solid ""A"" grade.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on a number of events transpiring in the small community of Maycomb, GA during the 1930s. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer, is called upon to defend a Negro man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) over allegations of rape from white woman Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox) and her father (James Anderson). While this race-fueled trial grips Maycomb, the children of Atticus have their own coming-of-age adventures. Jean- Louise, or ""Scout"" (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford) make a new friend in out-of-towner Dill (John Megna), obsess over the neighborhood legend of Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, and try (as best they can) to come to terms with their father's work.In terms of capturing the iconic themes of the novel, this film is able to accomplish that heady task, of which much credit can be given to director Robert Mulligan. In terms of getting the ""gist"" of the story, I could recommend either the book OR the novel (though I would highly recommended both!) and feel confident the message would come across in either format. It is also a film that can be enjoyed by children and adults in equal measure. Children will feel akin to young Scout, while adults will be taken in by the solemn themes interspersed with recollections of more ""innocent"" (or were they) and youthful days.What makes ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" truly special, though, is that Peck's Atticus Finch is easily one of the most iconic film characters of all time. I can't imagine reading the novel now and not picturing him as Atticus. He's the father figure of all big-screen father figures. While Atticus was a powerfully-written character even in the novel, one could argue that Peck even transcends that literature and brings more depth to the character. The courtroom scenes featuring Atticus in this movie are truly riveting no matter how many times you see them.Thus, I have to consider ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" to be one of my favorite all-time films. Even having seen it and read the book a number of times, it can still bring a tear to my eye and stir some pretty deep emotions. Both film and book complement each other perfectly."
cwente2,"Dec 21, 2005",9/10,"After forty-three years, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (TKAM) remains one of the most effective testimonials to the ravages of ignorance and prejudice ever recorded on film. Asking myself why this gracefully paced narrative has left such an indelible impression on so many, I've concluded it's because the film isn't about what most of its supporters and detractors claim it's about. Not about race or prejudice? . . . No. At its core, TKAM is about ""neighbors"" and ""community"", which concept forms the basis for the gravity of its message in the matter of Tom Robinson.Other films have followed on the familiar theme of racial bigotry and its well-documented devastations. These films have been consistently less effective because we are not asked to think so much, or to connect the history depicted with the histories of our own lives and our own communities.I've performed in two stage versions of TKAM, neither of which benefited from the brilliant input of screenwriter, Horton Foote. Both plays focus, almost exclusively, on the racial element of the story. They, like so many films of later years, come off as ""heavy-handed"" or ""in-your-face"" regarding this element. Well . . . ""If you think this way -- you're bad."" End of story. In TKAM (the film), we see a community of poor, unique, and apparently respectable people helping one another through a Depression. In stark contrast (and beautifully prepared by the film's creators) the injustices meted out to Tom Robinson and his family represent a dramatic anachronism of unthinkable proportions. And, it's as routine, in this gentle Southern community, as a child's fear of a mysterious neighbor, or a shy but happy exchange of hickory nuts for legal services rendered. Memorable? Most emphatically. Think about it. It's what director Mulligan wants us to do."
ma-cortes,"Feb 4, 2015",8/10,"Splendid and flavorful rendition based on bestselling novel written by Harper Lee , being perfectly scripted by Horton Foote . The film takes place from the summer of 1932 to October 31, 1933 , Atticus Finch, (Gregory Peck's favorite work , who earned a deserved Academy Award) , a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man (Brock Peters) against an undeserved rape charge . Meanwhile , he attempts to explain proceedings to his kids (Mary Badham , Philip Alford) , trying to understand life and against social prejudice .The most beloved and widely read Pulitzer Prize Winner by Harper Lee now comes vividly alive on the screen in this magnificent picture , being leisurely narrated and stunningly filmed . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay by Horton Foote who also earned an Oscar along with Gregory Peck . Well realized and deliberately paced ; being a powerful retelling , including evocative settings , appropriate cinematography in white and black by cameraman Russell Harlan and rousing musical score . Extraordinary acting by Gregory Peck as a small-town advocate at law who defends an African-American accused of rape . Support cast is frankly well ; cast members such as Mary Badham (Scout), film debut by Robert Duvall (Boo), Frank Overton (Heck Tate), Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella), Ruth White , Richard Hale , Paul Fix , and William Windom (Mr. Gilmer) , being narrated by Kim Stanley . Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Oscar nomination, ironically losing the award to another child actress, Patty Duke in The miracle worker (1962). Special mention to Brock Peters , as an inmate , wrongly accused as rapist ; he started to cry while shooting the testifying scene, without rehearsing it this way, and Gregory Peck said that he had to look past him, instead of looking him in the eye, without choking up himself . With the death of Rosemary Murphy (Maudie Atkinson) on July 5, 2014, Robert Duvall (Boo Radley) is the film's last surviving adult cast member . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by the great Elmer Bernstein ; the piano in Elmer Bernstein's score was played by John Williams . Adequate production and set design , as Art directors Alexander Golitzen and Henry Bumstead had an entire reconstruction of the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, built on the Universal backlot at a cost of $225,000 , as the set contained more than 30 buildings .The motion picture was magnificently directed by Robert Mulligan . Robert's way of handling his child actors was to let them play together while keeping the cameras as unobtrusive as possible. It is the first of six films director Robert Mulligan made with his producer partner, Alan J. Pakula . Director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula traveled to Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville but found it unsuitable for filming , the town had been modernized ; therefore the production team constructed their own ideal version of Monroeville on a backlot at Universal . Robert Mulligan was a good filmmaker expert on dramas such as he proved in ¨Bloodbrothers¨ , ¨Baby the rain must fall¨, ¨Kiss me goodbye¨ , ¨Same time , next year¨ , ¨The Nickel Ride¨, ¨The man in the moon¨ , being his greatest successes the followings : the eerie tale of supernatural titled ¨The other¨, the adolescent drama ¨Summer of 42¨ and this ¨¨To kill a mockingbird¨ . The latter ranked #1 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"" and in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #25 Greatest Movie of All Time."
smatysia,"Oct 22, 2001",6/10,"I remember really enjoying Harper Lee's novel when I read it more than 25 years ago. The film is pretty good, I guess. The child actors all did wonderfully. Gregory Peck did well enough as Atticus Finch, although I'm not sure it was an Oscar-worthy performance. The whole rape trial sequence seems overly preachy to me now. I suppose that in the early '60's there may have been people unaware of the realities of Jim Crow, but nowadays it has been forced down everyone's throat for decades. The heroic liberal fighting injustice is a theme whose time has long passed, and viewing TKAM now hasn't the sort of impact that I imagine it did then. Grade: C"
Sylviastel,"Feb 23, 2008",10/10,"Harper Lee created a classic in her novel. This film adaptation is probably the best novel to film ever. It stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in his Oscar winning role. Mary Badham plays the unforgettable Scout. One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor. Rosemary Murphy plays Maudie Atkinson. The film is first rate and classic which should never be remade even for today's audiences. It stands on it's own much Godfather and Citizen Kane. Please don't remake this film with today's stars."
questl-18592,"Jul 22, 2023",7/10,"I'm really annoyed by how relevant this still is. Movie came out 60 years ago and we're still dealing with the same nonsense and that is infuriating. That aside, I felt this film did a wonderful job of working a message without becoming preachy at any point in the runtime, something I deeply appreciate. Gregory Peck is exceptional. I know wish I could see a courtroom team-up with him and Jimmy Stewart from Mr Smith Goes to Washington... Maybe during the civil rights movement? Oooh, or maybe a TV show....That idea started as a lark and now I'm kind of obsessed with it.ANYHOW! Peck is amazing, really carries this entire movie on his shoulders because, unfortunately, everyone else was lagging behind. This feels like a stage production, with the over the top theatrics, the utter lack of subtlety. Hell, the 'villain' may as well have been twirling a mustache in that court room scene and the 'victim' was so absurdly bad that it really undercut a lot of what she was trying to say.Still, sign of the times, I suppose. Great movie, solid watch. Glad I finally got around to it."
roghache,"Jun 18, 2006",10/10,"While I must confess to not having read Harper Lee's novel, this movie might possibly rank with me as the greatest cinematic drama ever. It paints a vivid picture of the incredible injustice of racism in the 1930's South, a character study of a very principled lawyer, and a bittersweet view of childhood's innocence.The film relates the story of a widowed Southern lawyer named Atticus Finch, as seen through the eyes of his tomboyish young daughter, Scout. Together with her older brother Jem and their sidekick Dill, the children explore the goings on of their local neighbourhood in Macon, Georgia. They also witness the South's entrenched racism in their own hometown when their father takes on the case of defending an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a local white girl. Of course the jury is all male & all white, and many of the prejudiced townsfolk do not take kindly to Robinson's defending lawyer, even extending their outrage to Atticus's children. Meanwhile, the youngsters are inquisitive about their reclusive neighbour Boo Bradley, rumoured to be a dangerous madman.It would be difficult to imagine a more compelling and personal depiction of racism than this false accusation laid against the harmless, kind hearted Tom Robinson. These trumped up charges in fact result from the victim Mayella's own sense of guilt. Brock Peters perfectly captures the quiet humanity of this utterly sympathetic, despairing defendant who faces a predictable verdict from jury members who see all black people as liars. The scene where he breaks down on the witness stand will haunt you forever. Robinson's humble home and anguished family round out the portrait of this travesty of justice.Atticus Finch is surely the most principled, gentlemanly fictional character ever conceived, masterfully portrayed here by Gregory Peck, himself such an endearing gentleman. He brilliantly captures Atticus's sense of justice and morality as he takes on the unpopular and even potentially dangerous task of defending Robinson. This is a kind and modest man who treats everyone with equal respect...black and white, rich and poor...the white Sheriff, his black housekeeper, his unjustly accused client, his children, his neighbours, the poverty stricken but proud farmer who pays him with vegetables for past legal services. Atticus never appears more dignified than during his controlled response to a churl who spits upon him. He displays patience and understanding with his two motherless children, as he quietly tries to teach them true values of fairness and decency. If only every child had a father with the integrity of Atticus Finch to emulate, this world would surely be a wonderful place.The three children are engagingly portrayed by marvelous, perfectly cast young stars, the entire story depicted through their eyes. Scout is a feisty tomboy, unwillingly forced to don a dress for her school debut and later prone to fighting with any schoolboy who offends her. Her older brother Jem is fiercely protective of his father, displays endless curiosity about neighbour Boo, and mockingly accuses his sister of 'becoming more like a girl every day'. Their chum Dill, a funny looking and comical fellow, describes himself as 'little but old'. What an appealing and amusing trio they make! Atticus's black housekeeper, Calpurnia, is a concerned and respected mother figure, who takes Scout severely to task for her rude manners toward her young lunch guest!The 1930's Southern small town neighbourhood is perfectly captured. Many of the scenes occur on the porches and in the yards, with the kids up to their assorted shenanigans. Their tree house and tire swing bring back childhood memories, and I can still hear those crickets. Unfolding events compel these innocent youngsters to face the sad adult realities of racism and injustice. Boo teaches the children a valuable lesson about the dangers of preconceptions, and gives the adults an unforgettable sense of true justice. Unexpectedly, he proves to be part of the title's mockingbird allusion.The atmosphere in the small town courtroom is brought vividly to life as the spectators fan themselves against the stifling Georgia heat. William Windom (from Murder She Wrote) portrays the smirking prosecutor. The trial is itself gripping and Atticus's concluding remarks riveting and inspiring. During the final courtroom scene, the local black townsfolk reveal with great dignity their respect and appreciation for Atticus. This film is a moving tribute to those who fought against the evils of racial discrimination and an incredible masterpiece that no one should miss. Though tragic, it proves ultimately uplifting."
Manthorpe,"Jun 21, 2004",10/10,"Undoubtedly a classic hallmark in cinema, To Kill a Mockingbird dealt with social issues when social issues were still very much an issue in society, much more so than today although some of the same basic feelings are still present. Being younger than the film itself, I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release, I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so. Having read the book in high school, the film seems fairly accurate to the story except for a few very minor things that are mostly the result of a book being condensed into a much shorter journey.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role as Atticus Finch and apparently I'm not alone in that opinion as he won an Oscar for the role. All three children in the movie are also quite impressive and entirely convincing. I particularly enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall in his first film appearance as the ambiguous Boo Radley.It's very difficult to give reviews for older films, particularly ones that were made prior to my existence, mostly due to the inevitable fact that like everything else films also age, sometimes weakening the original potency. But to be honest, the only thing that I can see that has noticeably aged is the music, which is entirely understandable and is to be expected. And given the fact that it's over four decades old, that is quite a statement. It all boils down to a very important film about a very important and popular book in which social issues were dealt with and still holds relevance today. Like many classics, it's not just a movie, but a film with a message. A heart warming classic and an essential notch in the belt of film history."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jun 17, 2006",9/10,"For some reason, it took a long time before I ever gave this movie a look, and when I finally did last year I was very pleased and saw why all the fuss was made over it. Then, I watched it again about six months later and got disgusted with some of it. Maybe I should have waited another 40 years between viewings! (Only kidding)THE GOOD - Well, I can start with the fine acting and interesting characters, led by Gregory Peck as ""Atticus Finch,"" one of the more noble characters ever put on screen. He is single father taking care of two adolescents and is a strong moral man who stands for all that is right. The main theme of the movie is racism, and I'm sure this much bigger impact 44 years ago than today. It wasn't long after this that the U.S. was embroiled in numerous race riots. It was a tumultuous decade, to say the least. There also is a tiny sub-plot in this story which involves another kind of bias, one against the mentally-ill or simply against pre-conceived notions we might have of people who are different from us.Not only is Peck outstanding, but kudos to the kids in here, too, beginning with Mary Badham as young ""Scout."" She only made one other movie and never acted as an adult. She's a great kid in here and winsome in a tomboy-ish way. Her brother ""Jem"" (Philip Alvord) also is good, and has a wonderful scene in front of the courthouse protecting his dad against a mob. New-found friend ""Dill Harris"" (John Megna) has a much shorter role but completes the trio of youngsters who all prove to be capable actors. Kim Stanley narrates the film as grownup ""Scout"" looking back on those days.Brock Peters is good as the black man accused of something he didn't do, and it was interesting to see Robert Duvall in, I believe, his first movie role. He had done TV for a couple of years prior to this film. His role, however, was right at the end of the film and he said very little, if anything, as the misunderstood ""Boo Radley.""This is a very nicely photographed film with great lighting in here. The whole thing was shot on a Hollywood set. It looks super on the latest special-edition two-disc DVD. I enjoy watching the great black-and-white images in here but then again, it's easier to produce perfect lighting like this rather than going on actual location and adjusting to the conditions. Still, it's a visual treat.BAD - In the filmmakers' zeal to show the ugliness of racism they were insultingly biased in the courtroom finale and unrealistic in portraying the lead male racist. Being ""fair and balanced"" was not something shown in coverage of the trial since the most dramatic parts - the final summations - are wonderfully and powerfully presented by defense attorney Finch but we never hear the prosecution summation! What happened to that speech? We only hear one side! At least give us viewers credit for having enough common sense to know what's right after we hear both sides. The film world rarely treats the moviegoers intelligently, preferring to hit us over the heads with their agendas instead. And, showing this redneck ""Bob Ewell"" (James Anderson) going out all alone and ranting and raving in front of house full of blacks late at night is ridiculous. Nobody, but nobody is that stupid: white, black or any color. But, once again, the filmmakers do everything they can to manipulate their audience and this film is extremely manipulative.OVERALL - Nonetheless, despite the obvious bias it's still a good, powerful story with great moral lessons. It also gives us something we don't see much in modern movies: an ideal father figure, not just in the way he handles his kids but all adults, too. You can't find a much better role model. I'd like to see more of this types of people on film."
planktonrules,"Jul 6, 2007",10/10,"While occasionally my reviews go on and on and on, this one simply doesn't need to be exhaustive, as so much has already been said about this film and it has received so many accolades. Most everyone knows that this film is a classic and it deserves a fine reputation--particularly for the fine acting and writing as well as its social impact.Peck plays a small town lawyer who has been assigned to defend a Black man who has been accused of raping a White woman--a pretty tough subject for an American film of the era. The defense of this man and the town's prejudice is all seen through the eyes his children--making this film an excellent one to show children, though its appeal is universal (unless you are an avowed racist, I guess).Peck was one of the greatest actors of his age and perhaps apart from 12 O'CLOCK HIGH and possibly the underrated BIG COUNTRY, this was his greatest film role. See this and see him at his best."
Scout-40,"Dec 25, 2000",10/10,"The lessons of To Kill A Mockingbird have stayed with me since the first time I saw it over thirty years ago.  I was young then, but, I related to Scout and Dill having grown up in a small town myself. My own father was more like Mr. Ewell than Atticus.  The lessons I learned from Atticus helped me grow up to be someone other than what I might have in a dysfunctional family.  I learned to stand up for what I believed in, to appreciate others for whom they were and to use the intellect that came naturally to do so!"
Sfmooreman97,"May 4, 2017",7/10,Most of us remember having to read this book in high school but with the directing talents of Robert Mulligan and a fantastic cast this story of 1960s racial prejudice and childhood innocence is brought to life. The film accurately represents the feelings of the public of the time through the eyes of a child in a setting of racial unrest. The acting is as compelling as the story being told and its no wonder why both the book and film are considered classics to this day.
bigsarge1950,"Nov 23, 2000",10/10,This is an excellent movie. I have seen it at least 10 times.  Gregory Peck was outstanding in it. This movie has suspense in it. It also shows how prejudice can hurt people. I would recommend this movie as a must see.
CriticalViewing,"May 16, 2016",7/10,"Director Mulligan did a really good job of keeping true to the book of which this film is based, that was released only a short 2 years prior. Through brilliant framing, subjective pov, and long takes that often included monologues; this told and showed the story that has been a staple in America's history. It was highly culturally significant when it was penned, and it remains something that we look at today, because it dealt with more than just race, but also the stereotypes we place on people and how those are usually wrong (easily seen in Boo Radley's case). The film shows strength, cruelty, bravery in all of the everyday ways in which it as experienced, and that teaching doesn't end at with youth. That the student can just as easily learn, and then become the teacher. The best example is Atticus to his daughter Scout, who then speaks to Mr. Cunnighamn. She does so calmly and casually; she reminds him who he is when he isn't filled with hate and rage, and that her and her family are people just like him, reminding him that his son goes to school with her and of her father saying ""thank you"" after an act of surprise kindness he had done a while ago. She learns and grows throughout this experience, and is the vehicle through which the learning curve can be taught and seen to an audience that would have been conflicted during those times (the 1960s)."
kingsidharth,"Sep 12, 2013",5/10,"The film starts with the same essence as the book, but through experience I've learned not to compare much - they are two very different mediums.The problem begins with the film pacing up and skipping important events that build up motives of the characters and causes shift in their intent. Towards the end all of it looks like a rush. The importance and the the details of how grave the case of a lawyer actually backing up black man is lost in translation across the medium.Well, all of that can be forgiven and the film still somehow works along. But the contextual shock of a man attacking children is totally lost on screenplay, many dialog were changed which the climax dry and juice-less - taking all emotions out of it.Characters, especially Atticus's, were portrayed and played out very well. They are the only reason the film works."
Dormo,"Dec 6, 2003",8/10,"The film is unique in it's viewpoint, being that of the children in the movie and especially that of it's narrator , the girl ""scout"".With that viewpoint, the film deals with mature adult matters as seen through the children's eyes. It thrusts us into their world with their playfulness and fears, especially from their mad next door Neighbor.There are certain scenes that are depicted as horror with the right lighting and music to accompany them , for it is the childhood fears that are depicted there , thus letting us experience it through their eyes.The children are there in almost every scene, whether as witnesses or as the main attention. The child actors give some of the best performances I have ever seen of actors their age. They truly behave like kids do, and not like child actors acting as children, they are truly believable.And let's not forget Gregory Peck giving one of his best performances as the loving protecting father on one side, and the protector of justice on the other, as he is defending an innocent black man in the racist American south.In conclusion a great family drama, told with tenderness and care, depicted through the eyes of the children."

Primtime,"Jun 29, 1999",9/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird has always been a favourite of mine. I may have done myself a favour years ago when I decided to read the Harper Lee book before watching the film. It still amazes me to this day how exactly similar Robert Duvall's Boo Radley was to the one I pictured in my mind.Mulligan directed a fine film using a well established movie-star (Gregory Peck) and two children who hadn't been in any films previous to this. The performances of the children is of something beyond acting and it is this aspect that makes the film work so well. The film isn't overly long (which it could have very well been) especially throughout the courtroom scene.The issues dealt with during the film were still very touchy at the time this film was released. Perhaps the fact that this film is seen from the young girls viewpoint helps to be almost completely unbiased. The scene in which the lynching mob tries to get at Atticus and Tom shows the innocence of Scout, especially during her discussion with the father of one of her classmates. The whole basis of this film is the innocence of the children and how they make their way through the adventures and fears of the summer.I fully recommend this film to all.9/10 stars."
tatyz,"Jan 28, 2004",10/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie shows some of the problems between blacks and whites. These differences between two races make this story so special. The characters adaptation was very interesting, starting with Atticus Finch and his children. Also, I love how this story was told through the eyes of one child.In this movie were many things that make it interesting such as the characters, the theme, plot and mysterious elements. First, the main actors had a very good representation on their characters, for instance, Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem. The theme of this story was based in prejudice and was showing the differences between blacks and whites. Also, the plot was very detailed and exciting because Boo was scary and mysterious. Finally, Tom Robinson also brings to the plot the essentials of the movie.Although the movie To Kill a Mockingbird is very exciting, some things do not show the truth of the story. One of these things is when Mr. Radley cemented the tree's knothole and the children get down without knowing the cause. Also, something needing to change may be the Ewell family because they are an evil family without any feeling toward other people. The trial of Tom Robinson is conspicuous and sad because the movie itself makes him an important character. But knowing all these things, this movie is still great.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great movie where you can find one of the most recognized actors of all time, Gregory Peck. Mr. Peck stands out in all his qualities that are made by his values. One of the foremost qualities of Gregory Peck is his courage to confront the goals of his work and his personal life. Atticus Finch and Gregory Peck have a different life and feelings, but they are both moral men. Finally, both conduct themselves with dignity.In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful movie that I will like to recommend to everybody to watch. In this movie one learns about the social class, the good and evil. One thing that I really liked was to know about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Also, I felt empathy with many situations in the movie that reminded me of similar times in my life."
tthreadgill,"May 12, 2006",10/10,"I have come to the conclusion that the only way to rank films that are at the very pinnacle of movie-making is to get very picky and imagine what tiny facet or detail could be changed to improve them. With this criteria in mind I can think of only two movies that meet the challenge of being flawless, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Godfather"". I give the edge to ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" as the superior film because of the powerful social statement and Gregory Pecks incredible portrayal of the archetypal father figure, Atticus Finch.This is simply the finest overall display of movie-making I've ever seen and remains my favorite movie of all time."
fredrikgunerius,"Dec 20, 2024",7/10,"Quintessential coming-of-age-drama based on Harper Lee's 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Told from the perspective of the son and daughter of Atticus Finch, an idealistic lawyer in Depression-era Alabama, the film takes a puritan, almost self-righteous look at this society's attitudes towards race, inequality and prejudice. It's a message movie with a lesson so obvious and self-evident that it's hard to fathom it was - and can still be - relevant. It's also a well-told and quaint tale about the loss of childhood innocence and subsequent portal into adult life. This combination made it a darling of contemporary critics and audiences alike. Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, and Philip Alford deliver sympathetic performances as the father and children, respectively. And Robert Duvall is brilliant as Boo Radley in his feature film debut."
dangomezc,"Jan 21, 2018",10/10,"There have been several instances in my life where I am in dire need of something to soothe my soul, I normally recur to the usual things, like going for a walk or perhaps even writing. Other times I simply watch To Kill a Mockingbird. It will draw a smile in me with the first note, and at the last scene a tear.The reason why to Kill a Mockingbird cures my inside is mainly because of a single word: Innocence.In this day and age, these dark times. Like the ones we see in the movie, I believe we all need a drop of innocence on us, but we also need to be strong, we need to be resilient, but above all, we must have justice.In the movie and book, To Kill a Mockingbird means that it is a sin to kill someones innocence/inner peace, because all they do is ''sing'' for us. In a way I have always thought of this as not just that there is a mockingbird in all of us, but that to shoot the beauty and uniqueness of all people on earth has been the one and only sin that we have all committed. This sin may come across in the manifestation of simple thoughts of judgement against peoples actions, personalities or simply physical attributes. Boo Radley is the personification of this situation in the instance of the Novel/Movie.I am applying the situations in this movie to our present day counterparts and situation to explain my most important opinion about the movie: It is Timeless.The historical context of the movie is one of desperation, racism and injustice. But also at times: innocent, playful and hopeful. There is an Atticus Finch, Scout Finch and even Boo Radley in all of us. But the Bob Ewell we all have is also at risk of falling in the desperation and injustice, prejudice and a hate for ourselves and the world that sorrounds us.Atticus Finch brought to life by the one and only Gregory Peck was named AFI's number 1 hero in movie history. A man who will be timeless. His speech at the court is one of the best movie moments in history. Gregory Peck WAS Atticus Finch.All the actors in this movie are completely the way you would imagine them while reading the novel.The compositions by Elmer Bernstein are one of the most beautiful to ever touch the silver screen, and delight our ears. It fills the air with beauty, tension and makes us cry.To Kill a Mockingbird is the greatest film of all time because it isn't perfect, but the message is completely timeless, the world will always go through dire situations because humans tend to be complicated creatures. But there will always be a Mockingbird in all of us, and this movie reminds us of that.I always turn to this movie to find my inner Mockingbird, and to remind me that sometimes, injustice will be present, but the innocence of creatures and the good in mankind will prevail."

""Super Lawyer Tries To Save The South From Itself."" He's poor. He's rich. He's enlightened. He's educated. He's a crack shot. He stands down a mob (with the help of his wise and brave children). Where was the Sheriff? No need for a Sheriff when you've got Super Lawyer. He'll guard the jail all by himself. He is struggling against Ignorance, aided by the Mindless Duvalls of the world - who are guided by their innate goodness God gave them. I have seldom seen such claptrap outside of the Hallmark Channel, where the hero is always a woman who exhibits the same strengths and struggles. It's all so puerile."
s_a_n_d_w_i_c_h_e_s,"Sep 22, 2007",N/A,"Oh boy this movie is so awesome you will find yourself flying among the Angels when you watch it, or roughly about as high as they fly. This movie is so great it's like finding out your brother is famous.This film is based on a book, but that doesn't mean it's boring like all that other rubbish. In this case it means that the film is even better than possibly all other films based on books, but possibly in a different way to the way you might be expecting.The movie is all about a raper who must face his crimes and stand trial (as was traditional in the time and place where the movie takes place, and in that time too). The man who defends him as his attorney is a man with three kids, only one of them lives next door.The focus is on his kids as they fool around with rubber wheels and various other machinations. The film is told through their eyes, even though they are WAY TOO YOUNG to be attorneys.I have found it possible to think that this film is one of the most beautiful films there has ever been in the world. Even though I cried during the duration of this film and I usually don't like that at all (in fact I hate it if a film makes me cry because I feel like a baby), in this case I can forgive it because when I cried I had a lot of joy in my heart that made it swell up and make me cry from my eyes. But I did have a big smile on my wet face when I was crying. You will feel the same too if you see it, like dancing with your Grandfather."
spartacus92007,"Apr 8, 2006",10/10,"I could wax poetic for days about the defining experience of absorbing this remarkable film.I highly recommend the ""Collectors Edition"" DVD with the wonderful documentary of the making of the film.The casting, the score, the screenplay, the set, the cadence and the honesty of the depiction of a very special time in our history is, in my experience, without peer.Through all of the trials, tribulations and joys that life offers me I am always deeply touched and warmed by an engagement with this movie.This is simply the best movie I have ever seen."
taylorhammons,"May 12, 2018",10/10,"This is my very favorite book. Cliched, I know, but it's a classic for a reason. I read it freshman year of high school and immediately fell in love with the story and the characters. We were meant to watch the movie after reading the book, but we didn't get around to it, and at the time, I was glad. At the time, my experience had led me to believe that movie adaptations of good books are rarely good enough to live up to my expectations, and nearly 10 years later, I still believe that when it comes to most books. But after having to watch this movie in a film class in college, I was forced to admit that this is not always the case. This movie is flawless. It perfectly captures the tone and spirit of the book, the casting was absolutely perfect, the score is amazing and well timed, the emotions are real and vivid. This deserves all the accolades it gets and many many more. I only wish I had seen it earlier. While the book continues to be something I come back to time and time again, this is a rare case when I actually feel comfortable watching the movie instead of rereading the book if I want to save time. It's (almost) just as good. It certainly comes closer than any other movie ever did to capturing the subtle perfection of a novel. There's a reason that this is one of the few movies that is this old and Hollywood hasn't yet tried to remake it. I hope they never do."
Darth_Osmosis,"Jun 1, 2018",10/10,"Probably the best movie ever made about racism! Just like in the book it's not overly dark and depressing but shown through the innocent eyes of a child, many memorable moments don't even have nothing to do with racism. Gregory Peck is amazing in this!"
Tommy-92,"Sep 6, 1999",9/10,"This film is just as powerful and well-performed as you've heard.  From the scenes where Scout and Atticus have discussions, to the scene where Scout innocently confronts a member of a lynch mob, to the trial scenes, to the last scene, (featuring Robert Duvall in his film debut, in which he says so much without ever speaking), every moment is masterfully directed and beautifully perfromed.  Gregory Peck really deserved his Oscar for th role of Atticus Finch; his dignified portrayal of a single father called upon to ""do our unpleseant jobs for us"" is remarkable.  Not only is he wonderful and eloquent in the courtroom scenes, but his scenes at home are wonderful, too. He seems to be every child's image of the ideal father: stern yet kind, all-knowing, able to explain anything, and yet his kids know he can't do everything, though he can do more than they think.  These scenes also give him a chance to interact with the amazing child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, both of whom had never done any acting before this and yet are naturals.  Badham is espicially good in the scenes where she and Atticus discuss things; she senses so much, and yet is still so innocent.  She does a lot of growing up, but so does Alford, as he listens in on his father's talks with the judge and watches his visits to the Robinson home.  His maturing is much easier to see.  Both actors are just as good as Peck; their adventures are amusing and their performances excellent.  Brock Peters is also very good as Tom Robinson, the black man accused of raping a white woman.  You are not manipulated into feeling sorry for him; you just naturally are, thanks to his portrayal and the direction of his scenes. This is a wonderful movie.  I don't know if the book is better, as I haven't read it, but I know the movie is excellent.  Please see it."
inkblot11,"Jul 17, 2023",10/10,"In a small town in Southern Alabama, a widower Atticus Finch - Gregory Peck - is raising two children by himself. Jeremy or Jem is the older child while tomboy Jean Louise or Scout is the younger. Mr Finch is a lawyer and because these are the 1930s, he sometimes gets paid with farmers crops instead of money. One summer, the children acquire a new friend, Dill Harris, who they play with nearly everyday. It's Dill who is fixated on a reclusive neighbor named Boo Radley who never comes out of the house. Rumors are rampant about what this man is like and Dill wants to try and lure him out into the open. Meanwhile, Atticus gets the case no one wants. He is to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping the daughter of the towns most disreputable white citizen. This may put him and his children in danger because Atticus aims to defend the innocent Robinson with all possible skill. Emotions are stirred up to a boil. What verdict will be reached and what will follow? This wonderful film is a must see movie. Peck is, well, impeccable, as the soft spoken lawyer who believes in justice for all. The kids are adorable and the other cast members quite fine. The choice to film in black and white enhances the historical setting while offering spooky images when the plot thickens near the end. Most of all, the storyline of the humanity and worthiness of all races at a time of racial segregation and oppression is a lesson all need to heed."
addisonmaddison-50554,"Feb 22, 2025",10/10,"When the major character names (Atticus Fitch, Boo Radley, Scout, Tom Robinson, Bob Ewell) become ingrained in American society, the movie has leapt off the screen. A few years back, a local theater was screening old and classic films. Much like the reaction in ""1917,"" the audience for ""Mockingbird"" was silent as a group as the tale was spun. And at the credits, spontaneous applause broke out in the packed movie house. This movie sets the standard; yet, is it possible to equal it? Some have come close. But this remains the best movie ever produced. Others have tried (Shawshank, 1917, Pulp Fiction, e.g.), but ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" remains standing alone."
#1 Gracie,"Feb 2, 2001",7/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird, both as a book and a movie, has been hailed as a classic, a masterpiece, etc. I personally don't see what the big hoopla is.It seems that the movie is trying to be deep, trying to be artistic...and while a bit deep with the whole storyline of Tom's trial, in reality, that's all it did-try.They story is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, in the midst of the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in that county. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different ""storylines"" of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This story really showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic.I also might've enjoyed it more if they had had a different main character. I personally couldn't stand Scout. I understand that she was supposed to be an innocent, unknowing little girl, but she came off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that I wanted to slap throughout the entire movie. Maybe if it had been from Atticus' point of view, or Jem's, or just ANYONE aside from Scout, I might've enjoyed the movie more.The cinematic work was pretty good, but not extremely artistic. It's a far cry from the fantastic cinematic elements of films such as ""Traffic"" and ""Psycho"". While it had some good angle work and good lighting techniques, it wasn't really a great film in the cinematic field. To be fair, though, I suppose that that's not what the movie was going for.I give it a 3/10. The story involving the trial was beautiful, there was some good acting (Gregory Peck, to give an example-although I don't think his performance was Oscar worthy)...but it was such a long way off from all it was said to be, it just turned out to be an overrated bore."
atlasmb,"May 8, 2023",10/10,"Magnificently adapted from Harper Lee's novel, this film features wonderful words, excellent cinematography and editing, and some amazing acting.Gregory Peck stars as Atticus Finch, an Alabama attorney who is raising two young children. In the story, he defends a black man against a rape charge. Much of the story is told from the perspective of Scout (Mary Badham), his daughter, who also narrates the film. Through her eyes, we see Atticus as a paragon of wisdom and virtue. He is not a man without flaws, but he has a firm moral code and lives by it, even in the most difficult times.I can't think of any film that is more perfect than this one. In scene after scene, it touches the heart. Kim Stanley deserves credit for her wonderful narration that fairly caresses Harper Lee's words and beckons the viewer into the world of small-town Maycomb.The film was nominated for eight Oscars."
akon5,"May 26, 2002",7/10,"I don't know...but I guess I am sorry for not agreeing with the general opinions about this film. I like it. It is a good film, but I don't seem to be able to see why it is so great. The story don't seem to give many 'arguments' as to why the black man was innocent. After the trial, I still don't know if the man is guilty or innocent. The movie is supposed to be about a discrimination trial. However, it is alittle short for the purpose it serves for the movie. However, the first half is not about that. It is pretty much a perspective from the children...it sort of made it a children's film. However, during the second half, the attention was shifted. I guess one can't make a movie entirely on a trial. But because of this spread of storyline, they couldn't touch deep enough of both of the things they wanted to say. There are also few scenes which I thought was not logical. It is a good movie. But I don't think it is a great movie."
discoroux,"Dec 25, 2001",5/10,"I have read the novel & seen the movie, & I don't understand why everyone says it's great. I hated both, though the film was a tad better than the novel. Gregory Peck is probably the only good thing about the film. However, he is like Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. His scenes are solemn, while just about everything else is goofy.There are several things I didn't like about both the film & the novel. First, the names. We have two Greek names (note, this is the southern US), a dog's name, a pickle, an onomatopoeia, and a name that's being pronounced 3 different ways. Second, Dil should not have been written into the story in the first place. He was annoying in the book, & even more annoying in the movie. He had one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard, it looked like his head was too big for his body, and if he's so rich why does he only have one change of clothes? Third, events that were irrelevant to the story. There were a lot more in the novel, which the screenwriters were smart enough to leave out. In the film, there are only two big ones: Mrs. DuBose & the mad dog problem. The last one I'm going to talk about is how fast Jem matures. He's only 12! To quote Cameron Crowe's film Almost Famous, ""You've robbed him of an adolescence!!"" I'd explain more things I didn't like, but I have a word limit.So in conclusion, I thought this was a bad film, though I thought the novel was worse. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time. I've seen the movie twice and I don't get why it's such a classic. I'm glad Lawrence of Arabia won the Oscar that year (though I thought that one could have been a bit shorter.) Have a nice day! =)"

mts43,"Apr 27, 2024",9/10,"This film takes place during the peak of post-slavery racism in the South. When this film premiered, and although the South had lost the Civil War nearly 100 years before, the Civil Rights movement was still just building momentum in the South, and meeting violent opposition from Southerners. Author Harper Lee, herself a Southerner, showed great courage in writing this novel. Alan Pakula and Robert Mulligan showed commendable character resisting the not always subtle pressures from people to tone down the depiction of racism as it really was. The acting by the entire cast was.superb. James Anderson's portrayal of the trashy racist Robert Ewell was so convincing it makes one wonder if he was really like that?"
ivanmessimilos,"Mar 15, 2025",8/10,"I finally watched this classic. I didn't read the book so I'm just rating the movie based on how I liked it. I think the movie is great and special, it deals with the topic of racism very well, especially at that time. I found it a bit unusual that a lot of it was shown from a child's perspective and that children had a relatively long screen time. Regardless, I think the child actors were excellent. For me, the real star was Peck in the role of lawyer Atticus Finch. He deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of a just and intelligent man who will do what needs to be done in any situation. There are several great scenes, the best for me is definitely the one in the courtroom, a cult scene when he questions witnesses and delivers a famous monologue. The only downside to the movie is that I wanted to see him even more in the movie because he was a real role model for all people."
drqshadow-reviews,"Sep 14, 2020",9/10,"A powerful, loyal adaptation of Harper Lee's novel that cuts to the heart of the racial dialogue without condescending or coddling.Gregory Peck won an Academy Award for his performance as Atticus Finch, the thoughtful father and dignified lawyer who's driven by moral convictions, but his work is enriched by several crucial supporting roles. Child actors Phillip Alford and Mary Badham (also nominated for an Oscar) play a convincingly earnest set of siblings, enthusiastic and inquisitive avatars for the audience. The authenticity of their lock-stepped performances might be partially lain at the feet of director Robert Mulligan, who opted to run with many first takes, lest the youngsters grow weary of the repetition. Brock Peters also shines in limited work as Tom Robinson, a black man on trial for a flimsy rape accusation. Peters really only gets one opportunity to make his mark, but it comes at the emotional crux of the story and he sees that it hits home.The film isn't without weaknesses - antagonists often seem a little too narrow and stereotypical, and the flat (if essential) epilogue undercuts the power of the film's real climax - but those are minor nitpicks. On the whole, To Kill a Mockingbird is a smart, well-reasoned picture that still speaks to America today, generations after it was set, published and adapted. Jim Crow may be dead and buried, but so long his influence still resonates, this story will carry extra relevance."

reddragonhero17,"Jun 22, 2023",10/10,"I never had a father in my life, but watching this almost every year compensates for that fact, and helps me develop into a father whenever the time comes. Gregory Peck is perfect for the part of Atticus Finch a humble everyman who stands tall for peace and justice even when the odds are against him, and distills words of wisdom on his children no matter how naughty they can get. Of course the two children do what kids do, they do get better, especially Scout our narrator who learns important life lessons. Of all of them, the one that stuck with me the most was ""you can never understand a person until you have crawled inside their skin and walked around in it"". Some people may to this day balk at watching a black and white picture, but the time period it takes place in and the style of the story is enhanced by being in black and white. Of course don't assume a good story is over until you see The End, I won't reveal it, but it will have you thinking."
tmojoman,"May 2, 2007",6/10,"I finally saw this movie last night after I checked it out at my local library. This is a wonderful service of our state tax dollars, loading up on a bunch of DVD's that we all can check out for free. Anyways, I checked out this movie as it is called by most movie fan's as a classic and supposedly one of Gregory Peck's greatest roles, especially since he won an Academy Award for his performance. Without going into a lengthy review, I will say that I went in expecting a riveting, profound movie with excellent court scenes throughout most of the movie. While there is some genuinely interesting, thoughtfully written and superbly executed court drama going on, it couldn't have been more than 25 minutes of this two-hour movie. The remains of the time goes to the two children and what they get themselves into while Atticus is off at the courtroom. While that would have been perfectly fine for say, 30 minutes or so, it runs rampant at nearly 90 minutes of the movie. This was honestly astounding as I thought this was going to be a courtroom drama with minimal activity outside of it. This was hardly the case. Still, it is far from a bad movie, and the scenes with the children are entertaining in their simplicity of a time long since gone. And Peck, while a bit emotionally stunted (as usual), still does a very good job in his role (though I am interested in the quality of the other Oscar-nominated actors from that year because I don't see Peck's role as an Oscar winner, rather just Nomination-worthy.6/10."
ckolet37,"May 17, 2013",5/10,"I read the book. That's the reason why a film with an 8.5 average gets a 5 from me. I read the book. If I didn't, it would still be an OK film, there are so many scenes that feel out of place, and so many important characters that got cut out, and the characters that they DID leave, were not developed. Another reason was, that the actress who played Scout (I don't care what her real name is, just read) was annoying, really really annoying. Every time she spoke in that false southern accent, it made me cringe. The person who played Mayella Ewell was enjoyable though, and I thought Tommy Wiseau was a bad actor. Now the majority of praise for this film was Gregory Peck as Atticus, and... it really didn't do that for me, not that it was bad or anything, but it was all in a personal preference. In the end, if you want to see the film, see it first. This is one of the only times I will tell you this because it works. If you want to love this film like everyone else does, see it first."
Jexxon,"Nov 15, 2004",N/A,"This film may have been great once, but today it feels rather dated.Sure enough, the film looks and sounds great even by today's standards. It has a sort of fairy-tale feel to it, which is also pretty nice, but it's essentially a 1½ hour kids film with 30 minutes of courtroom drama oddly spliced in there. Therefore, I can't help but feel that the story and the way people act turns very naive at times (Little girl to angry lynch mob: Please, don't be mean! Angry lynch mob: Well... alright then.).And while the movie deals with racism, it does so with such stereotypes that it looses the edge. The blacks are humble good people (saved only by the grace of white super-dad Peck), and the most whites are a bunch of snarling rednecks.The kids are surprisingly good actors, and Dill may be one of the coolest kids I've seen on film, but after an hour of them running around playing, you grow tired of it. Peck (as the best, most caring, fantastic single parent in history) does one of those performances that you're supposed to really admire, but I think it's pretty stiff and stilted.Overall, it's good in parts, but it lacks that ""something special"" that can turn it into a classic.

daviddaphneredding,"Oct 24, 2012",10/10,"This screen adaptation of Harper Lee's outstanding novel ought to have won the Best Picture Award of 1962, though it didn't. Gregory Peck was his pleasant, calm self, but he was a man of courage nonetheless. He was definitely brave: to defend a Negro in the 1930's South, especially in Georgia, did definitely require a plethora of courage. Brock Peters showed prowess as the black falsely accused of a heinous crime. I liked seeing Paul Fix as the local judge. As for the small part of Robert Duvall, who would have ever thought that nine years later he would be portraying a very capable and shrewd Mafia lawyer? As for the setting and the life style of a small southern town, I could identify myself with that: I was raised in a small town in central Kentucky, about five thousand in population at the time (the 1950's) where everybody knew their neighbors well. How could the point of the story not stick well to the viewers' minds? And with all the negativeness of the Great Depression, the small town lifestyle was, in its own strange way, appealing. A very drawing movie."
ahatim,"Aug 21, 2020",9/10,"Atticus finch a good hearted lawyer & widower with 2 young childrens in a racially divided alabama town agrees to defend a black man accused of raping a white women. Many of the village people try to pull Atticus out of the trail. But he decided to go ahead. Mean while atticus children are intrigued by the townspeople in prejudice against Atticus for helping black people.Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch. Be it direction, screenplay or acting, everything seemed to be balanced in this movie. I had read the book before watching the movie and doubted if the movie could live up to the book. But it certainly does. Gregory Peck is as though he was born to play the role of Atticus Finch. More like he's not acting but just living the role. The first time I sat down to watch this movie I was thinking ""there is no way that they could have fit every aspect of the book into a one or two hour movie."" I was wrong. This movie is without a doubt a masterpiece. I am a movie lover to the fullest and I don't know why I had never watched this film. I cant say anything great about it that hasn't been said but this drama had so much to offer. The cinematography and editing in it alone was just wonderful. There were many dissolve cuts used throughout, and several medium and medium-long shots as well. I liked the use of the montage in the beginning of the film, followed by the slow tilt to establish the location of the film. However, I really think the use of sound is what brought this film together."

The story/plot is well written and shocking/sad and for the time, this movie has good acting. The music and cinematography, camera work, and directing are all great as well. It even comes off as a creepy film every now and then which I actually enjoyed. I was surprised by Robert Duvall's performance and character, he wasn't in the movie much and didn't have any lines at all but his presence on screen felt special for some reason and was placed well at the end. There were a couple of slower scenes in the movie that could've been cut out in my opinion, however that definitely didn't ruin it. I can see why this has a high rating!"

Although only a minor quibble, the movie was filmed on Universal's backlot and looks it. Overall this movie is superior family entertainment, and I recall it being a huge deal when shown for the first time on network television. Special credit to the child actors who played Jem (Phillip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham)."
theodoric357,"Jan 24, 2008",6/10,"Actually, I have read the novel before watching the movie, and I think the book is better than the film. In my opinion, the film wasn't fully capable of bringing the origin author, Harper-Lee was trying to express, since some parts from the novel were left out, making the events rather irrelevant to the book. Another thing is that the focusing was not so appropriate: the focus should be put on the rape trial; but in the film, the rape trial was rather sketchy. However, the junior actors (the children) acted well, as well as Gregory Peck (as Atticus). In conclusion, the film is generally acceptable, but not so eminent at all.I would give it a 6 out of 10."

himitsu,"Jul 26, 2001",1/10,"If you've read the book of the same name, that's really as far as you need to go. Skip the movie, it's not worth your time.While the book had a somewhat richer storyline and a better narrative, the movie falls flat on these areas, concentrating far too intensely on the center plotline, effectively snubbing most of the cast in one way or another. Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch becomes the main character in place of Scout, which was probably the worst decision of the entire movie. It drags on like nothing else I've seen, and in general is the worst adaptation I've ever watched, and a terrible movie by itself. Any redeeming points the book had (despite it's general mediocrity, the book did have good character development and narration) were cut down by the movie. In four words, this movie is bad."
Harry_Gleeson,"Aug 16, 2020",8/10,"Pros:The performance from Gregory Peck was outstanding and rightly earned him the Best Actor Oscar that yearIts rightfully a classic, highlights an important issue that was showed on film for the first timeThe many meanings it conveys throughout the film is amazing and well donePhilip Alford who played Jem was noticeably good for the age he wasThe ending nicely ties up the filmAtticus Finch!Cons:For me, there were parts of the film, mainly towards the start, were I thought it was dragging and I was waiting for something to happen.Overall, 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is the classic example of how to convey an important human issue on screen. As I say, it may have been one of the first films to make its story about racism. Gregory Peck delivers a wonderful performance as Atticus Finch, his authority on screen is consistent throughout the film and certainly commands the role. The writing was well put together, especially the trial scene. A fantastic monologue from Peck. My only itch with the film if I have one, would be that I was finding it was quite slow in parts, especially towards the start, however this is an absolute classic that has stood the test of time and can even be shown nowadays stillQuote - ""In the Name of God, do your duty"" - Atticus FinchScore - 4/5"
lorithered,"Mar 28, 2020",9/10,I highly recommend the book but if you are anything like I was in high school you skipped the book and went straight to the movie. It's a good thing that this movie is so well done because I got an A on my book report after having not read the book and only having watched the movie. I eventually read the book as well and it was definitely worth the read.
prshanthxyz,"Aug 13, 2018",8/10,"The movie is one among few that capture people in their routine at a time in America that people now hardly recollect. The way it captures racism and white supremacy, people standing up for equality, the notion of the white American and most of this through the eyes of a young curious girl is unique indeed. However the film at various points lacks clarity. This maybe an indication of the equipment those days. I haven't seen a remastered edition."
dfle3,"May 30, 2008",8/10,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, this movie combines truth with fiction to illustrate a certain time in America's history. It takes a while to suss out the nature of this movie or what it's about. So, we're sort of like the nominal central character of the movie, ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), the young daughter of Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), a hick town lawyer in America's Deep South (in the 1930s). Therefore, the early part of the movie has Scout be the centre of attention along with her childish concerns and relations with her younger brother and a new friend who is visiting.Later, this child centred point of view comes to encompass more adult concerns and, particularly, a legal case Atticus Finch has decided to take on...the defence of a black man charged with raping, I think, a white woman. At first, Atticus, seen from the children's' point of view is nothing special or exceptional. One of the pleasures of this movie is how their father transforms into someone to celebrate.Brilliantly evoking an America which existed even as little as 40 odd years ago, this movie and the book it was based on must have seemed a pebble in the shoe to a country which eulogised itself and its virtues.Finch, in court, is a quiet and smouldering figure exemplifying integrity and the pursuit of justice. Perhaps the court scenes aren't the most realistic ever filmed but the evidence conveyed is plausible and lucid. In fact, it's superior to the jury deliberations found in ""12 angry men"" which are somewhat logically jumpy. In other words, this movie seems to want to keep the court room evidence to a minimum for fear of boring us. It's brevity isn't a major flaw though.Sensitive issues are dealt with subtly in Mockingbird, but I do wonder if the fate of Finch's client was glossed over superficially without Finch type analysis from the film makers...or author?In black and white. Check out ""The curse of the Cat People"" which I review here and also deals with the world of childhood."
elvircorhodzic,"May 13, 2017",9/10,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a crime drama about family love, racial intolerance, ignorance, playfulness and acceptance in the difficult times after the Great Depression. Film is based on Harper Lee's 1960 novel of the same name.The two young protagonists are brother and sister, who lives in a fictional town in Alabama. The story covers three years, during which, they undergo changes in their lives. They begin as innocent children, who spend their days happily playing games while imagining a subject of their lush imagination. The children's widowed father is a town lawyer and has strong beliefs that all people are to be treated fairly. However, the racism and evil in their city are exacerbated by poverty. The children's need to grow up very quickly. A local judge appoints their father to defend a black man, against an accusation of rape of a poor white girl. Their father accepts the case, that will stir up passions in the entire city. The children's will finally meet their Mockingbird...This emotional story is full of innocence, positive energy and charm. The young protagonists are like drifters on the street, which are trying to play relentlessly in a very dangerous world. An excellent cinematography takes us into a mystical world of the American South. Everything is very close, and yet, everything is so far in that world. This is not a strong human or courtroom drama. The magic is present in those little moments that change our everyday lives. That magic is visible through the voice of a young girl, the smell of ripe melons, laziness of the summer heat, wind that sways a swing on a porch and a friendly face in the night. Mr. Mulligan has added these segments in a line with the social crisis in a community. A man, as an individual, is completely helpless in this melodrama.Plots are constantly alternating, so we can think that their social whirl does not have its place. The consciousness about good and evil is a part of a harsh knowledge in the eyes of two young children. Mr. Mulligan has balanced this story between children's fetches and serious themes. The essence is in the relationship between a father and his children. This story did not show, in a credible way, trouble with growing up, first encounters with evil people and situations in a society that is far from an ideal. But those are minor shortcomings in it.Characterization is excellent.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is the embodiment of a tolerance, compassion, understanding and courage. Mr. Peck has offered a convincing performance. John Megna (Charles Baker ""Dill"" Harris), Mary Badham (Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch) and Phillip Alford (Jeremy Atticus ""Jem"" Finch) were excellent, along with the fact that little Mary has definitely stole the show as a curious girl.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson was impressive in a small, but very significant role. He is like an injured beast, which is aware of the fact that no one will be able to save her. Robert Duvall as Arthur ""Boo"" Radley is an invisible monster and fallen angel at the same time. His character has contributed to the strong finale of this film.Everyone has, given the time and place, met a Mockingbird."
Horror-yo,"Dec 28, 2016",6/10,"It's a good film in that it's got content, that is well executed, by strong acting throughout, and a good moral at the center of it.It's overrated in that it's really not a brilliant film but was one of the first big films that put the oppression of the American black man in the foreground of the plot, with a very strong emphasis on the injustice of racial discrimination. Most of the film's strength, the thing most people will remember, is that scene at the trial of the black worker. But there isn't in fact anything cinematically exceptional about that scene, or anything else here for that matter.It's slightly untidy as well, and a bit disjointed. As the film starts it seems we'll the protagonists will be the group of children which we closely follow the adventures of, until a drastic change in atmosphere occurs as we're plunged right into the trial's guts; and it seems the momentum built in one area of the film goes silent for a new one to take rise, and so on; the dynamics are on alternative current. Just take the film's very title and tagline: 'to kill a mocking bird'. It isn't obvious until the very last scene, an ambiguous ending really, where it seems the film loses a lot of what it's setting out to do in the first place."
Artimidor,"Dec 24, 2011",10/10,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own right. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's full support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight well deserved nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including Best Actor for Gregory Peck, a portrayal tailored so convincingly after Harper Lee's real life father that a lifelong friendship between actor and writer developed. Even Peck's granddaughter would bear the name ""Harper"", to appreciate the mutual appreciation. Family is also on the forefront of the film: Peck really epitomizes the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who is set to defend a black man accused of raping a while girl, convinced of his innocence. Finch has two children he needs to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause - against all odds. Actor and character shared these principles, and it shows.What makes book and movie so special is that everything is seen through the eyes of the children rather than from a more objective perspective. That way the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events more or less by accident and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never dies - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this picture. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love, and it excels in dealing with all of the mentioned categories. Whether in form of the novel or the film, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" should be integral part of anyone's education."
dorMancyx,"Nov 13, 2022",7/10,"Surprisingly, the most prestigious trial in To Kill a Mockingbird is but an independent segment from the rest of Scout's account. Linear storyline, elaborate development, and compelling performances especially Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch: a dependable father, an upright lawyer, and a respectable man. However, in my opinion, the overall story and message is rather decent in today's setting, as I'm not too invested in the plot or the old-movie- vibe of the film. Indeed, I'm aware that the film is still a renowned examination of racial discrimination within the judiciary system, but personally, I view it as another outdated sensation of the time."
bill-dean-2,"Sep 5, 2005",4/10,"The courtroom procedure is the worst ever shown on the big screen. Lawyer Finch never brought up the impossibility of a one handed rapist to choke his victim as described. He did a silly exercise to show the girl's father was left-handed yet never brought this point home. He never brought up character references to show the reliability of the defendant. This oversight even existed in the novel, even though Tom's employer interrupted the court to pronounce this fact, and was dismissed from court. Prior to the trial the movie was more believable than the novel, which portrayed a first grade girl with vocabulary and reasoning ability of a much older person. This reminded me of a similar performance by the similarly aged young boy in the novel ""Painted House"". Just not realistic. I realize that to be critical of such a popular movie is akin to griping about movies such as ""Casablanca"", ""Miracle on Forty Second Street"", ""Its A Wonderful Life"", and their brethren. To my mind the performance of Gregory Peck is the bright spot in an otherwise boring movie. The bright spot was the statement by the black preacher to ""Rise; Your father is passing""."
Rachel-30,"May 12, 1999",N/A,"I, like many people, have studied the book in great depth for my GCSE English Lit exam, and felt that after a while of intensive study Harper Lee's masterpiece had been lost beneath piles of notes. This film revived the magic. It superbly portrays the world of Maycomb and stirs up the emotion of the book all over again, and time has certainly not effected the quality of this cinematic treat. A must see for the student, the film fan, or anybody with a sense of justice."
filmbuff-05706,"Jun 19, 2023",10/10,"I am not much of a reader, so I don't usually compare movies that are based on books. However, I sort of have to with To Kill A Mockingbird. I read the book for English when I was a high school junior, and I actually found the movie on Blu-ray around that time.That was 7 years ago, and I saw it again today on TCM. It was being played for Father's Day. Even on its own, it is a great film, and it's one of the best adaptations of a book ever created, and one of the best movies I have ever seen.To Kill A Mockingbird follows Scout, a tomboy with a brother named Jem, and a summer friend named Dill. They live in the South in the Depression Era, where racist prejudice is abundant in town, but not from her lawyer widower father Atticus, played by Gregory Peck in his most famous role.Atticus takes on a big case, one that has the whole town talking. Tom Robinson, a common black man in the town, is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus is the only white man in town who thinks that he is innocent, and that causes a stirrup in their town.Like I said, I can't write about the movie without mentioning the book. Luckily, even that is praise. The book by Harper Lee is already a fantastic classic novel, and one of the best books I have ever read.The movie follows the book very closely, very little is taken away and I don't think anything is added, apart from maybe some dialogue. Those who love movies that stay close to books will adore To Kill A Mockingbird.To Kill A Mockingbird is also one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made, one to rank with 12 Angry Men, A Few Good Men, and Judgement At Nuremberg.The acting is also superb, especially from Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for playing Atticus. In fact, the American Film Institue (AFI) named Atticus Finch the #1 Hero of American Cinema.His acting shines best near the end, when he gives a powerful and riveting summation speech in court. It's a 6.5 minute speech, and Gregory Peck did it all in one single take. How he memorized that so well is beyond me, but he deserves much acclamation for that scene alone. It's a miracle.Speaking of that scene being riveting, I watched it on YouTube once and never looked at the time stamp, I was so invested.Harper Lee, who wrote the novel, also loved his performance. She based Atticus on her own father, and said that Gregory Peck was the only actor who could have played Atticus. She even gave Peck her father's pocket watch, and refused to let any sequel or series be made on screen, since no one else could fill the role other than him.The kids are wonderful in their roles too, particularly Mary Badham, who plays Scout. Fun Fact: Her and Gregory Peck remained good friends up until Peck died, 41 years after the movie's release. They even still called each other Atticus and Scout.Also, there is a minor character named Boo Radley who speaks no lines. This is the first major film role of Robert Duvall, a whole decade before he played Tom Hagen in The Godfather.To Kill A Mockingbird is an absolute masterpiece. The pace may slow down a time or 2, but that is a very nit-picky flaw (the size of a period on a page) in an otherwise excellent movie.It was even nominated for Best Picture at the 1963 Oscars, however it lost to Lawrence of Arabia. That's not a bad movie by any means, but if Best Picture winners were up to me, I'd pick this before Lawrence of Arabia.Regardless if you are a bookworm who wants a great book to film adaptation, a film buff who loves classic movies like me, or you just want a really wonderful movie to kill 2 hours of your day, there are few movies that I could recommend any higher than To Kill A Mockingbird.Happy Father's Day."
Coventry,"Feb 19, 2022",9/10,"There are many reasons why ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is - and forever will remain - listed among the greatest movies ever made, but they have all been written down already in the other reviews on this page, in fancy books about cinematic history, and on specialized websites. What else can yours truly add? Not much, except that this film deserves every littlest piece of praise that it gets, whether it is for the depressing atmosphere that so aptly depicts the racist Southern states during the poverty of the 30s, the stellar performances of the ensemble cast (including the least annoying child actors I ever beheld), or the captivating plot with its numerous highlights of sheer drama and tension. It's all perfect. Well, ... almost. The only thing I always found weird, when I first saw the film 25 years ago and still today, is the unnatural silence and discipline in the courthouse. Despite the huge differences and hatred between the Maycomb people present in court, everybody listens politely to the other party's pleas and respectfully allow the others to finish their sentences. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is probably the only courtroom classic ever that doesn't feature typical sentences like ""Objection, your Honor!"" or ""Order! Order in the courtroom!"""

cschiefferle,"May 27, 2021",8/10,"If you haven't read the book, you should. This movie left a few crucial elements out, but there's only so much you can fit in a 2 hour movie.

basrutten,"Jun 30, 2004",7/10,"There's no doubt that in the time this movie was released, it made quite an impact, an in many aspects it's still a good movie. The anti-racist message this movie carries might not be as bold as when the movie was released, but since racism is still happening around the world, it never hurts to warn against it. No problems here.Overall, the movie also makes a well-made impression. The acting is good (I'm surprised that a movie this old sports such good performances by children), telling everything from the perspective of the little girl work surprisingly well, too, and the movie is very honest and direct, without the sentimentality or audience manipulation you'd probably see in (most) modern movies about such serious themes.However, I think this movie hasn't aged particularly well. By now, we've just come to expect a bit more of movies in terms of plot and cinematography. In ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" the plot is rather simple, the pacing very slow (with way too much time spent on the children and their games), and the cinematography very static.Ultimately, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is still a well-made, genuinely honest and touching movie with a message that manages to still be quite good in spite of its (when compared to modern movies) cozy pacing, static cinematography, and somewhat simple plot*** out of **** stars"
MovieGuy109,"Oct 29, 2011",10/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird was the only novel Harper Lee ever wrote and it shook the world. The film had much the same impact of the novel with good reason. Peck gives a typically excellent performance as Atticus Finch. The kids are likable in their roles and the character Dill was inspired off Harper Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote! It's personally made, definitely Mulligan's best. He does a fine job of combining 1930's Alabama life and an intense courtroom trial into one even film. Robert Duvall makes an on-screen appearance as the mysterious Boo Radley. One of the best early 60's films and a great adaptation of a great novel."
StarlightPosim,"Jun 22, 2005",6/10,"I have seen this film several times over the years, from childhood to middle age. I used to like it better, as a child, than I do now, as a middle-aged woman. Parts of the film, most notably the lyrical and sometimes humorous treatment of childhood and maturation, remain moving and beautiful. The segments about the unbalanced neighbor are just as scary for me today as in the 1960's. I wish to raise a point on which I will concede that I am acutely sensitive. What bothers me about this film (and probably would about the book, tho' I haven't read it) is its treatment of the white woman and her allegation--namely, that she must (of course!) be lying. I'm well aware that there was and is plenty of racism in our society, and that grave injustices have been and sometimes still are committed. However, all too often members of society seek to ""make up"" (as tho' that were possible) for past injustices by inflicting new ones, or to use this line of reasoning as an excuse to not deal with real problems. I spent 17 1/2 years in school and I've been in the working world for a quarter-century in several different organizations; in all of these places, I've experienced a lot of harassment, both physical and verbal. I can assure you that even today, supervisors, coworkers, the whole personnel and management apparatus will do practically anything to avoid having to deal with harassment, particularly sexual harassment, just as they failed to deal effectively with it in any of the schools I attended. To use a legal term, the burden of proof rests squarely on the accuser, to report, document, and (my personal favorite!), explain why the person would do what he's doing, rather than put the harasser on notice that his behavior is totally unacceptable and must stop. No, instead these caring/sharing/wonderful folks in society want to examine your words and deeds to see whether you did anything to provoke the harasser. Then come the excuses; he's having problems at home/school/work, so you should exercise a little forbearance when he hits you, screams obscenities at you, and otherwise treats you like dirt. Or, he comes from a ""different culture"" (which, near as I can tell, is code for he's from somewhere--perhaps from somewhere as nearby as his own head--where it's OK to treat girls and women as 3 steps lower than a goat--who knows, maybe it's just your perceptions that are off!). So, these sweetly reasonable, compassionate people imply that it's OK for him to scream, or hit, or kick you. Of course the problem isn't that he doesn't choose to exercise the ordinary self-control required of civilized beings, or that the powers that be, thru their excuses and inaction, tacitly but nevertheless clearly communicate to him that it's OK to continue behaving this way. It's rather as if they want to balance the whole burden of society's past problems on your back! Of course they can preach to you in this offensive way--after all, it's Just you it's happening to, not them! Observe what happened to Anita Hill at the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. If that disgraceful episode proved anything, it's that women are the only group in America that it's still OK to treat badly. I realize that in this film, the viewer is supposed to know that the accused man is innocent, not guilty. I just wish the powers that be, the PC crowd, could've used some other example to show this. And I wish that some of the admiring viewers could discern the major flaw in this film."
jm10701,"Apr 25, 2014",N/A,"My taste in movies has changed in the 50+ years since To Kill a Mockingbird was released. I loved it then (I loved the book too) and have remembered it fondly ever since. But now it seems stilted and phony, even the stuff with the kids. Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and Gregory Peck is overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold as an icepick.It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing - not entertaining or enlightening at all. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of paying anything for it, even the few pennies an online rental costs."
silva-w-pius,"Jan 30, 2014",8/10,"Arguably the strongest bond of any relationship between two human begins, more than; the husband and wife, more than two sister and even more than a mother and her daughter. The strongest of all bonds is the one shared between a father and his son. The father being the mentor, whose job it is to help his son, to guide his son through the unsteady, turbulent and sometimes painful sea that is life. His kind words of encouragements must act as sails boats to guide us into man hood. Well Mockingbird is not strictly just a father and son relationship, there is also a daughter added to the mix, but despite that, Atticus Finch is the perfect illustration of what a good father should be as with stern love and mostly importantly education, he teaches his children to love in a world full of hate, and for me that's the greatest lesson any father could teach his children. And To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect illustration of a true American classic. Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece novel by Harper Lee (Her only novel), writer Horton Foote and director Robert Mulligan, ingeniously guide us through a painful period in human history for all those involved, a period of economic turmoil and the very apex of racial tension in the deep south, Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932 to be more precise. But what makes the film the even more compelling is how we are shown a world filled with so much ugly, but at the same time we are lead to a single red rose of beauty, because we are shown the world through the eyes of 6 year old girl called Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) a high spirited and precocious young girl, who despite her innocent smile, you certainly don't want to find yourself on her bad side. On her journey she is accompanied by Brother Jeremy Atticus ""Jem"" Finch (Phillip Alford), neighbourhood friend Dill Harris and last but not least farther Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. But it's through Scouts eyes we see her father a nigh-on perfect, eloquent and intelligent lawyer seeks to uphold what is true and just, in a world that seeks to abuse and belittle a whole race of people, as he puts it upon himself to protect a black man in court against the bigoted arm of injustice. The black man is Tom Robinson and he has been accused of raping a poor white girl named Mayella Violet Ewell, but as you would expect in 1932, an all white jury sees him as guilty even though the film consistently paints him a positive light, suggesting he is innocent. Despite this, Atticus still endeavours to protect a man he firmly believes is innocent, leading to one of the most impressive and compelling (and longest) courtroom scenes in history. The two things that stood out to me the most was, for one Gregory Peck performance as the father, which I felt he defiantly deserved his Best Actors Oscar for his performance, because as many times as I watch the film back I can't help but fall in love with it again and again, because peck is able to take a onion layered character who one point his a pacifists, loving father, then a second later he shots down a dog 100 meters away with just one bullet, as if he was in a Clint Eastwood film. And it's this ability to take such a complex character, with so such juxtapositions at his core, and be able to do Harper Lee's character a great service with a gentle, controlled and fine paint brush flick from a true artist. The second thing that stood out for me was the three young actors who made the film such an enjoyable and funny watch, each brought passion and enthusiasm to the role, which helped Foote's script truly come alive. Ranked 33rd greatest American film for a reason! An intoxicating watch, I strongly recommended it as viewing for all occasion."

I honestly don't know what I was smoking in high-school cause this movie was great! The dialog was what stood out to me at first, It so fast and funny and charming. I don't know if that is due to the movie writers or to Harper Lee in her original book. But it was great! Also I see how this role became one of Peck's biggest performances, cause it was captivating.

Although the story sounds like a courtroom drama, in fact it is hardly such: The plot revolves around the everyday life of the two little kids of Finch (M. Badham and P. Alford), with the trial being rather out of focus, and portrayed in a piecemeal way.This last point is the grave weakness of the film, at least in my humble opinion. Everything else is fine: The acting is superb (with the two children definitely stealing the show, despite Peck's indisputable calibre), the atmosphere of the small city is skillfully presented, and of course, the anti-racist message of the movie is powerful. Yet, the problem is that ""TKAM"" continuously preoccupies us with the children's games and mischiefs, thus distracting us from following soberly (a) the capture and trial of the accused man, (b) the clash between Finch and his co-villagers, and (c) the clarification of what finally happened and who is responsible. In other words, the film fails to keep the focus on where I believe it should remain from the beginning to end: Finch, the defendant, and the community.I am aware that at the time when this film was produced (early sixties), the issue of racism was still considered a taboo, and thus the launch of ""TKAM"" probably would touch sensitive cords; perhaps this explains the rather childish and melodramatic approach used by its producers, as they were possibly trying to take off some heat from its core message. This might be OK for the sixties, seventies, or even eighties. Yet, by watching it in 2004, I definitely left only partially satisfied. ""TKAM"" is a classic, yes: But if it had been produced today from scratch, I believe it would be much more focused and coherent."
ivan-22,"Mar 3, 2002",N/A,"I'm sorry I don't really like this film, much as I approve of its goal. It has many good things: heavenly music, great black and white cinematography, likable young actors (who alas, did not have much of a career), noble purpose, pleasantly slow pacing. But all this does not coalesce into greatness. The drama is too overwrought, long-winded, and there is never any doubt who the good guy is. I especially disliked the courtroom scene with its histrionics revolving around a tawdry subject. It clashes with the film's overall dreamy lyricism. I tend to dislike films based on novels. Their dramatic shape is never quite right. Give me filmed plays anytime. I'm sad that John Megna died young and that there isn't more of him on screen. He had a poignancy."
suldertehgengar,"May 11, 2017",8/10,"This movie is a very faithful retelling of the classic novel of the same name. Faithfulness seems to be one of the main goals of this film; Even though colored film was very possible in 1962, they intentionally chose to film the movie in black-and-white in order to capture the feel of the 1930s setting. It also does a good job at tackling the themes of racism and discrimination in a manner significantly less vulgar than you'd expect, though I'll avoid going into details to keep this relatively spoiler-free.Every aspect of the film is finely crafted. The child actors, despite their youth, do a great job at portraying their characters' emotions and stances changing throughout the film. The music intentionally plays primarily in scenes involving the children, whereas scenes focusing on grown-up Atticus have none to emphasize the essentially different world that the children and adults live in. The camera also uses a lot of low shots pointed upwards to emphasize how small the children are. It's a finely crafted film that allows you to pick up on different details every time you watch it."
abdealidahodwala,"Aug 23, 2023",9/10,"The film is beautifully shot and directed.The film is also notable for its use of black-and-white cinematography, which helps to create a sense of time and place.To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful and moving film that is still relevant today. It is a story about courage, compassion, and the importance of standing up for what is right. The film is a must-see for anyone who loves classic American cinema.The film's depiction of racism is both powerful and heartbreaking.The film is a reminder of the importance of compassion and understanding. This teaches us the importance of compassion and understanding, even for those who are different from us."
SaraNP,"Jul 28, 2021",8/10,"One of the few films that's actually better than the book. The film makers managed to take a rather protracted story (I don't mean the story in itself, but how it's played out and depicted in the book, with it slow pace and weird dramaturgical structure) and make it interesting with a clear purpose and constant forward movement. I would recommend this to anyone."
Anudeepsambaraju,"Jun 7, 2020",8/10,"A Must Watch Classic with Thought-provoking message and Brillant Acting. My rating 8.5/10.Premise - A story of two children Scott and Jem where they experience the harsh reality of 1930s southern America, and how they learn life lessons from their father Atticus Finch who is Nobel, Respected lawyer. And he is also our hero Atticus, defends Tom Robinson a black man who falsely accused of rape by Mayella Ewell a white woman. Some of the town members were against the decision of Atticus and gives him a hard time. And a subplot of Boo Radley who is mentally handicapped, Scout, Jem, and Dill (A Neighbor kid) was curious about Boo Radley.Features - Based on the novel by - Harper lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" widely successful and earning the Pulitzer Prize.
Director - Robert Mulligan.
Cast - Incredible actor Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, Mary Badham, and Filip Alford as Scott and Jem
Review - To Kill A Mockingbird was Nominated for 8 Oscars including the Best picture. And Won 3 i.e. in Best Actor role, Best Set decoration, and for Adapted Screenplay.Unlike the other movies where the Story more focuses on Characters of Accuser, Victim and Crime scene, Investigation.... To Kill A Mockingbird tells the story of racism, injustice, prejudice through the eyes of Scott and Jem (kids) who are, innocent, empathetic, different from others who lost theirs in adulthood. This isn't only a story of racism, To kill a Mockingbird tells the story of courage, poverty differentiation, protecting innocence, and a story of Scott and Jem who feared and integrated by Boo Radley, And how they learn life lessons from their father Atticus, who teaches them the importance of treating all equally irrespective Of Skin color, Status, knowledge, religion. Like Atticus said in the movie ""You never really understand a person Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it"". Every discussion between Scott, Jem, and their father Atticus is just astonishingly beautiful.The best part of the movie, The 40 minutes courtroom segment where every aspect like Dialogues about injustice, law, and racism, Camera angles, Smooth editing is brilliantly done with perfection. maybe this is the Best Courtroom scene in Movie History. Some might say this movie is overrated but considering the time it came out, During the civil rights moment, and showing a different perspective, I call Mockingbird Movie Daring, influential, inspiring, and must-watch movies.The performance of Gregory Peck playing Atticus with wise, compassionate, and thoughtful is marvelous also earning him an Oscar. The 6-minute long continuous scene in court where Atticus gives a closing statement to defend Tom Robinson talks about racism and also the reason for Mayella accusing, Gregory Peck gave a tremendous performance. The other actors also did a decent job and other factors like directing, Cinematography given such good care to the script.Verdict - To kill a Mockingbird explains complex issues in a simple manner makes it the best storytelling for all kinds of ages and the performance of Gregory Peck will be remembered. Definitely, a must watch the film."
Groverdox,"Feb 14, 2019",7/10,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a strange experience viewed with the wisdom of hindsight. It's like two movies grafted together, luckily both being pretty good, but making an uneasy hybrid.It works best as a coming of age tale, told from the perspective of Scout. I wish the whole movie could just have been that. When the perspective shifts to Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for the role, it gets a bit creaky. I think coming-of-age stories are timeless. Treatment of racism, however? That gets old and embarrassing quickly.It is a testament to the movie's power that it's treatment of the racially motivated false accusation of rape at the movie's centre is not as bad as it might be, but it is still pretty cringe inducing in the way it resolves to make Finch into a noble white hero at the expense of black extras playing characters who should have gotten speaking roles.The resolution attempts to tie together the coming-of-age story and the legal drama, and is a brilliant resolution for the first, but barely seems to touch the second.It might have worked in '62, and I think the real reason why people still worship this movie is because it reminds us of a time when these queasy issues could be dismissed without too much thought. It's not adored for its agelessness - on the contrary. It's a time capsule. A reminder of a simpler time."
jes535,"Feb 9, 2007",5/10,"This is a great movie if you have the stomach flu and are over 45. It also helps to be a white liberal who wishes he could be the kind of upright, loving, articulate father Gregory Peck plays in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" I remember watching the movie when it was originally released in 1962 after having read the book. I am not the kind of person who cries easily, but I remembered crying over both the book and the movie. It was with my tears in mind and a difficult-to-define recollection that this is truly one of the great films that caused me to rent the DVD.Watching it made me realize that there is a world out there that doesn't have the stomach flu. ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" is better than any stomach remedy if you are of the right demographic, as I am. I cannot imagine a 22 year-old (one of my children is 22) sitting still for the slow-moving pace of the drama or for the tedious subplot concerning the emotionally-disturbed young man who lives in the neighborhood.This is a movie about racial injustice and how wonderful Gregory Peck is to defend a poor, frightened black man who is accused of rape in the South during the Depression. The sort of injustice described here is now lost to boring history books. Racism in America still exists, but not this particular flavor of racism that those of us who found it so familiar can appreciate. The racism I have in mind is like a fine old wine; namely African-Americans not treated as human beings in the deep South while a noble white guy enters the fray and gets credit for being noble.Watching this movie is like reliving the bad old days when every stereotype is blatantly reenacted and the pleasure is in watching which stereotype will come next. This is not a movie about how hard it was to be black in the South in 1932. This is a movie about how pleasurable it is to remember the days when a brave white man like Gregory Peck represented what we like to think of as bravery and racial justice.My guess is that most 22 year-olds wouldn't like Gregory Peck even if they knew who he was. Try it and see. Even if ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" does not stand the test of time, it still will be a comfort in a time of stress to folks like me."
jjh6519,"May 27, 2000",10/10,"Every once in a while, there is a movie that successfully brings tears to my eyes, no matter how often I watch it.  To Kill a Mockingbird is at the top of that list. The scenes of Scout being shown by Atticus what she will inherit when he dies, of Scout finally meeting Boo Radley, and most of all, that most important journey through the woods by Scout and Jem -- these are the key tearjerker moments for me.(COMMENT: I have read many of the previous comments.  As with so many other movies, I am tired of hearing comparisons to the novel.  You simply cannot do in a movie what you can in a novel, and conversely, you cannot accomplish in a novel what you can in a movie.  This film is so intense, so innovative in cinematography, acting and music, and you simply could not get that out of the novel.  That's why there are novels and that's why there are movies. It's a different experience! I recall people complaining about how major plot elements from the novels Dr. Zhivago and East of Eden were left out of the movie versions.  Well, duh! Look at the sizes of those novels!  There is no way you can cover it all in a theatre!  You must choose what is most important to the main theme, and go with that.  This is what happened in To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie.  You do know, by the way, that Harper Lee loved the movie, don't you?)I remember the first time I showed the video to my youngest son and his best friend.  They were about Jem's age.  They were literally transfixed.  They were glued to the screen.  One of the elements that helps keep us so emotionally caught up in the viewing of the film is Elmer Bernstein's exceptional soundtrack. Then, there's the opening credits set inside the cigar box full of childhood toys, possibly the most original I have ever seen, and definitely a brief commentary on Boo Radley's childhood and on the loss of innocence.The theme of innocence is so integral to this film.  Boo is innocent.  Tom Robinson is innocent.  Scout and Jem are innocent now, but we realize that someday, they could be like all their bigoted neighbors...except for the superb example their father is showing them.Atticus Finch is indeed one of the outstanding heros of American film.  What he does is not much in the grand scheme of things, but he puts his neck out for an innocent black man, knowing the consequences of his actions.  And yes, there are awful consequences.  This is his heritage to his children. You know they will be like him some day.   I appreciate knowing that the character of Dill was based upon Truman Capote as a young child, as this was a semi-autobiographical novel by Harper Lee, who knew Capote.  This helps us understand Capote a lot more.This movie is a masterpiece.  It moves me, and I take it that it moves many others.  (By the way, I have a new CD of the soundtrack by Elmer Bernstein, re-recorded and with the orchestra directed by Mr. Bernstein.  I highly recommend it.  It goes from sweet and lovely to downright frightening. If you've seen the movie at least twice, you can follow the story just by hearing the music.)"
Leendert_Wagenaar,"Jul 26, 2004",10/10,"Almost all of the comments focus on the anti racist aspects of the film and honestly, when I read the description, I did not really like I wanted to see this film. But when it came on the TV, I stayed up late to see the movie and was deeply impressed by it. And here's a thought:It is not just about racism, it is about the morality of the people. The title refers to that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, for those are beautiful creatures. In essence the film (as well as the book) is about the morality of Atticus Finch. You may consider him too idealized, but he is there to represent a morality, and as that he is necessary a stereotype. Furthermore, there is the popular morality and all sorts of private morality that linger through the film. Some examples:-Atticus reminds us: 'shoot all the blue jays I wanted - if I could hit 'em; but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird' (Remember that Atticus is capable of doing quite much, but is not showing off. For instance, he is silent about his good shooting skills towards his children. That's because he has a sort of inner peace and does not need the outside world to really understand him.)-Scout: If you shouldn't be defending him, then why are you doing it?Atticus Finch: For a number of reasons. The main one is that if I didn't, I couldn't hold my head up in town. I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do somethin' again.-Heck Tate: To my way of thinking', Mr. Finch, taking the one man who's done you and this town a great service an' draggin' him with his shy ways into the limelight-to me, that's a sin. It's a sin and I'm not about to have it on my head. If it was any other man it'd be different. But not this man, Mr. Finch.In the end, this movie is not about social issues, but about moral ones."
Cinemayo,"Feb 2, 2005",9/10,"Based on the classic novel by Harper Lee, this wholesome adaptation stars Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning part as Atticus Finch, a righteous defense lawyer during the depression era down South. He's a loving single parent who tries to instill values into his two children, Jem (Philip Alford) and his younger sister ""Scout"" (Mary Badham). The story is told as a flashback from the perspective of a now-grown Scout (who narrates) during one memorable summer in her youth where her father elected to defend a Negro farmhand named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). At a time when black people were not well respected in small southern towns, Finch stands alone in his plight to help the innocent young man who has been wrongly accused of raping and beating a white woman. Brock Peters is highly sympathetic as the good-natured Robinson during an unfair courtroom trial, with Gregory Peck as his well-meaning attorney with the odds stacked against him. Fine acting also by young Alford and especially Badham as the children learning about bigotry through their dad in addition to the ongoing trial. Robert DuVall makes his very first motion picture appearance in a small but unforgettable part that remains crucial to the success of the story. ***1/2 out of ****"
fowlerjones,"Sep 18, 2000",10/10,"I can't say enough good things about this film. It's one of my personal top ten films of all time. One of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein. He was veteran film music composer; he scored over 200 films. I don't mean to ignore the great story and the on-screen performances here. Browse the other user comments for those raves. I want to zero in on the quality musical score. It really drove home the emotional impact. Bernstein captured the curiosity and fear the kids had for Boo Radley, that later became understanding and appreciation. Other films with great Bernstein scores: The Great Escape (1963), The Magnificent Seven (1960), and The Ten Commandments (1956). Hats off to you, Mister Bernstein."
asaquon,"Jan 7, 2001",10/10,"A classic movie.  Excellent movie which catches the spirit of the book, a feat difficult for most films adapted from books.  Great performances by entire cast.  The novel itself is a staple among many high-schools, so the film is a good accompaniment."

benbelfield0,"Apr 13, 2015",7/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird was fairly engaging considering it was a movie
that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off
rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the
movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another
good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it
was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well
done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was
shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and
it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some
people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white
movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty
solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch,
although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all
that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the
movie. I'd say give it a watch unless you aren't interested in black
and white or old movies."
James-198,"Sep 5, 1999",N/A,"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece to me.  The film in its quiet way speaks volumes about racism in America.The performances in the film:  Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, and Brock Peters were outstanding.  I believe that Mr. Peck has said that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was his proudest accomplishment on film.  To me, Gregory Peck has always been my favorite screen actor.  No matter what role he has every played, you believed what he said.  His remarks in the courtroom scenes were so heartwrenching.  Atticus Finch was a wonderful character.  He stood up for what he believed in even though he was being ridiculed by his friends!In this age of technology, I sincerely hope that someone doesn't ""remake"" or ""colorize"" this classic film.  To do so would be to destroy a truly magnificent film.  To all those studio executives in Hollywood, please listen to your public ---- please, please do not remake this wonderful film.You owe it to yourself to see this film.  I know that it is nearly 40 years old, but like a lot of things in this world, they better with age!!!!"
Coxer99,"Mar 5, 1999",10/10,"Peck is perfect as Atticus Finch, a true man of the people. A devoted father, lawyer and human being. He is deep rooted in moral feeling, thus his influence on so many people who have ever read the book or seen this film. Peck makes him bigger than life, because that's what he is."
johnmbale,"Jun 13, 2006",10/10,"Not since Mark Twain have we had such a compelling essay of childhood, superbly brought to the screen by the young members of the cast, with the bonus of the courtroom drama and the eloquence of Gregory Peck in his finest role. This is superbly crafted film which beautifully explores a nostalgic period we would all like to revisit perhaps, the idealized family of our youth. Certainly a fine adaption of Harper Lee's remarkable book, and it is the masterpiece of the 60's, which was a great period in cinema. There is a dark side to life in this sleepy Southern town, moral dilemmas, and racism, as seen through the eyes of the children, with the lightness of touch that endears us to the characters, and a wonderful feeling for the mood of the early 1930's. A great American film and a must see."
jaredmobarak,"Aug 10, 2006",9/10,"While enjoying many novels that I read during my stint in the public school system, Harper Lee's classic To Kill a Mockingbird was always one of the most memorable. The story was beautifully told and showed a great example of moral fiber. Atticus Finch is the epitome of class and trust. He sees past age, race, intelligence and instead views the soul. After watching this film you might start believing that people really are inherently good.Perusing through the list of films that director Robert Mulligan sat behind the camera on shows me that maybe this film was his masterpiece. I have never seen nor heard of the rest of his filmography, (not to say he doesn't have any other gems in that list, I just wouldn't be able to tell you their names). He seems to be a very capable director, however, as the movie is shot quite well. The contrast of the black and white during many night scenes is effective and he does a good job framing the actors as they do their thing. There aren't any effects shots or skewed angles; Mulligan allows his cast to carry the film and that is a good move. The story is strong and the words are what matter most.Gregory Peck is just as good as everyone says he is here. He embodies Atticus completely, as a strong willed man of the community, a shrewd and moral man of the law, and a caring, loving father. Peck displays the many facets of his character as he treats all with the same care. His children call him by his first name and wander around the town alone. To Atticus, they are just as independently responsible as himhow can he second-guess his own children? Speaking of those children, it is hard to believe that both Scout and Jem are played by first-time actors. The kids, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, are amazing. They act well beyond their years, showing the teaching that goes on at home behind the scenes. Not only are they intelligent, but they can watch out for themselves. Scout is not afraid to pick a fight if she believes someone close to her has had his/her honor called into question, and no matter how much Jem chides his sister for being too much of a girl, he is always there to defuse hostile situations and make sure his sibling is unharmed. Both child actors are very effective in their line delivery and most noticeably in their facial expressions. It sometimes appears that their reactions are about to go over the top, but they have the ability to keep it all grounded to reality. The most fun is their stubborn fear of neighbor Boo Radley, whom they've never met. Although shown very briefly, and without a single line of dialogue, Robert Duvall, also making his film debut, (which surprised me as I thought his premiere was THX-1138 since it almost seemed like a collegiate film, but in fact was filmed nine years later), is very convincing as the troubled young man who has come out of seclusion to help resolve the incident which takes place at the movie's finale. Talk about speaking and emoting through only your body language; one knows exactly what Boo is thinking thanks to Duvall's performance.To Kill a Mockingbird never drags throughout its duration. Even for someone who has read the novel, everything occurs with suspense and spontaneity. While yes, the climax in the courthouse is the shining moment, all that bookends the sequence is just as enjoyable. Gregory Pecks' closing statement to the jury is magnificent however. His powerful performance almost made me want to stand with those watching on screen as he left through the door upon the verdict. Atticus Finch truly is the greatest screen hero of all time."
guy_anisimov,"Feb 22, 2007",8/10,"what is it that makes this film different and so much better then many other similar films?well first of all it has the great Atticus Finch (Gregory Pack) in it, who delivers an outstanding heroic and historic acting performance, that will make it hard for each and every one to stay indifferent to.second of all, after watching it it will be clear that it is not just one more film that comes to tell us a civil rights story in which the black person turns out to be the victim.in my opinion the whole Tom Robinson story in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is only secondary.it is a good connection between the children and their fathers enemy that thanks to his attack the real mockingbird of the story is revealed.you can try for hours but trust me this is the only way in which a person like Atticus Finch could create himself a true enemy, by representing and protecting someone that is hated.with Tom Robinson being secondary we are left with the children being what makes this film so great.Jem, Dill and Scout that the whole film is narrated through her eyes.we get the summer adventures of those three children's childhood years and even if this doesn't sound too exciting it is just an extraordinary thing to watch.'To Kill A Mockingbird' is simply unforgettable, a film that will stick with you long after you finish watching it."
g-bodyl,"Aug 29, 2015",10/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a film that could very well be two films. It's a drama about growing up and coming of age during an era of civil rights unrest. But that civil rights unrest also is the subject of the second ""film,"" a courtroom drama featuring a black man wrongfully convicted of a crime. This is a fantastic movie and one of the best movies to come out of the 1960's. But the racial themes underlying this film is still relevant today, and perhaps people should pay more attention to Gregory Peck's speech at the end of the movie regarding racism. There have never been more truer words spoken on film. I loved every aspect of the film from the very tense drama to the excellent black-and-white cinematography to the satisfying ending to the excellent score by Elmer Bernstein.Robert Mulligan's film takes us to a Depression-era town where a poor lawyer named Atticus Finch lives with his two children, Jem and Scout. Finch is assigned to a case where this black man is convicted for the rape of a young woman. The town gets riled up about the case, and Atticus and his two kids may find themselves in danger.It's funny because a film based off a beloved novel would gain more of a well-known cast. But the only star here is Gregory Peck and he does a wonderful job as Atticus Finch. I think that speech he delivers in the end gave him that Oscar. Mary Badham does a wonderful job as the young Scout, and I am disheartened that she stopped her acting career soon after this film's release, because she gave such a magnificent performance. Also, this film is Robert Duvall's first screen role and with limited screen time, his character as Boo Radley is another memorable character this movie offers.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best films of the 1960's or even in the history of cinema. Not only is it an effective drama, it has racial themes that occurred during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. This is one of the films that actually put sympathy towards the movement during this time period. One of my favorite scenes involves Atticus standing guard against a mob in which Scout comes to his rescue. That was a very moving scene and one of the many memorable scenes in the film. A fantastic movie that is part of our history and one for every generation to see.My Grade: A+"
ivana-7,"Aug 27, 1999",6/10,To kill a mockingbird is one of the few books I read in my young life. And its the first book that I liked better then the movie. The book has more detail and more character change. I guess that is why so many people read books. So if you want to see this movie I suggest to you to read the book first.
Theo Robertson,"Mar 8, 2008",6/10,"It wasn't until last night that I actually got round to watching TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD . It's something of a legend and is reflected that it's in the IMDb top 250 movies at position 46 but i'm somewhat baffled as to why . Grogory Peck isn't bad but his performance as attorney Atticus Finch is disappointingly one note . He won the best actor Oscar for his role here but it's not a performance that shows that Peck has much range and other actors have failed to win Oscars for better performances through the years . The story itself is inoffensive but very predictable in that you know fine well that the man in the dock is a victim of racism rather than a murdererI truly believe that the only things this film has in its favour is that the child actors are bearable , but so were the children in Charles Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , which despite being a masterpiece , did not come close to achieving the commercial and critical acclaim that this film did . We also have the novelty of seeing an unknown actor called Robert Duvall with hair but IMHO it's far from being a classic film . Please don't lynch me because I didn't like it"
monk1300,"Mar 17, 2006",2/10,"I read the book and saw the movie, thinking that it would clear things up. The book sucked, no other word for it. But let's talk about the movie, the plot line was terrible, as well as the book. I like the message of racial issues, but I think we know all about that. The acting was good, but for me what makes a movie for me is the plot line, plus good acting. If you disagree with me, please e-mail me at monk1300@aol.com. No one could convince me that this movie should belong in the top 250 movies of all time, or even better to convince me this movie is a masterpiece. Bottomline the movie was bad, can't cover up the plot with saying that the book was a great piece of literature."
lastliberal,"Apr 11, 2008",9/10,"With three wins among eight Oscar nominations, this is one of the best pictures of all times. Gregory Peck won one of those Oscars for what is certainly his best performance.It was Mary Badhams first film, and she received a well-earned nomination for her performance as Scout. It was also Phillip Alford's first film. Both of these children performed as well as many actors with years more experience. Of course, Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay, based upon Harper Lee's novel contributed immensely, but the two young actors really made you believe you were watching real characters.In an interesting note, it was also Robert Duvall's first film. He was the ""Boo"" Radley referred to throughout and not seen until the end.The summation given by Peck has to be one of the greatest of all times, and he truly was, in the words of Miss Maudie, ""born to do our unpleasant jobs for us..."" Which, of course, includes reminding us of when we fall from what we should be a humans."
Rinho18,"Jan 28, 2001",8/10,"To Kill a mockingbird is my number 145 movie. It is very original and the actors are great. I usually do not like black&white-movies, but this movie is an exception ( but it is not the only one ). The film is about Atticus ( Gregory Peck ) who is the lawyer of a black man, and that is why he loses his authority in the town. All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and I recommend it to fans of serious films. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them."
ednadoug,"Feb 10, 2007",10/10,"The 800+ people who gave this movie a 1 shouldn't be allowed to vote in the future. They have no concept of quality. Oh that's right--no sex, no vile language, so pardon me. I had a chance to be part of a small audience that Mr. Peck spoke to on his 80th birthday. He said that this was his favorite movie, which says a lot when one considers the quality work that Mr. Peck did during his career. There were no a weak performances by any characters--major or minor. The outstanding storyline of To Kill a Mockingbird allows the audience to interact with the key players. This movie has been rated as one of the top 50 of all time. I would put it in the top 25."
haroldchen2003,"Dec 30, 2006",10/10,"Hi,I'm glad that so many people appreciate this film.My mom is always a big fan of Gregory Peck.""Roman Holiday"" is quite popular in Asia Pacific countries(you know,female audience).My grandfather even buy a Vespa motorcycle at that time.But my first impression about this actor only remains ""handsome"" at that time.Some people say that they pretend someone like Atticus Finch could have been their father instead.You can see how successful he played in this role.The calm,generous,every day kindness character in this film sets up a good example for us to admire and follow,though a little bit idealistic.The slow,steady pace of this film,without ordinary drama excitement,however did a wonderful portrait of this small town,and the Atticus calm character.And Gregory Peck himself is a really respectable person even he is off the screen.And being an attributer to the issue of civil right.That really makes this film a all time favorite.PS:I am not a native speaker.So if there is any grammar incorrect or misspelling,pardon for my inaccuracy.Thank you.I'm really glad that there is a place I can express my own feeling about this movie."
moonspinner55,"Nov 13, 2005",8/10,"Well-made film from Harper Lee's controversial but justly-celebrated book with Gregory Peck standing pensively tall and mighty as Atticus Finch, one of the most warmly regarded literary figures of the past century. Mary Badham does sterling work as a young white girl in the South watching with interest as her lawyer-father defends a black man on trial for raping a white woman. The coming-of-age dramatics and the rural atmospherics are ladled smoothly but thickly, and the juxtaposition with the heated courtroom theatrics is a bit bumpy; still, all the trial scenes are riveting, and Peck certainly earns his Best Actor Oscar with his fatherly approach and quiet grace. The film is difficult at times and perhaps tries too hard at others (it has a heavy spirit), but it's also quite rich as a character-study and it has a profound affect on many people. *** from ****"
m-abtahi,"Jan 22, 2024",7/10,"I recently watched the classic film ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" dating back to 1962. Vintage films not only tell compelling stories but also aim to impart valuable lessons without squandering the viewer's time. It's uncertain whether they achieve this goal successfully or not.From the struggle against racism to parenting, the war between poverty and wealth, the role of religion, defense of the oppressed, the refusal to take on guilt by a young girl's narrative, and the exercise of democracy throughout the years, the film explores various themes. It confronts illusions and superstitions, providing the viewer with insightful reflections.Directed by Robert Mulligan, the film is a cinematic journey worth experiencing. A friend who had read the book, like many adaptations, claimed that the original novel offers a richer and more detailed narrative. Nonetheless, watching the film is a worthwhile endeavor.As a side note, I also watched ""Holly Motor"" and found it rather perplexing, unable to decipher its meaning."
Shannon-32,"Sep 26, 1999",10/10,"I love this movie.  Gregory Peck definitely deserved that acting Oscar.  The acting was excellent, the direction was flawless, with the exception of Boo Radley, which the movie didn't show the real relationship between him and the kids like it did in the book (read the book first, it's always better than the movie).Nonetheless, this movie is to be regarded as a classic.  I've watched it a few times and this flick never ceases to amaze me.  It should be shown in every junior high and high school classroom as an example of society in the Depression-era South."
ger55champ,"Feb 15, 2019",7/10,"The acting all round was believable and superb.

nudles,"Sep 29, 2006",1/10,"Supposedly, this is one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Whenever I hear this, I can guarantee that I will hate the movie. This holds true for TKAM. I have tried watching this movie over and over again, hoping that I will ""get"" what all the hype is about. I don't. I'm sorry. It has to be one of the most boring, slow moving movies ever.I don't understand why this movie, On The Waterfront, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, and Citizen Cane are purported to be such super-duper films. I think they're all tripe.Sorry, folks. Maybe I'll like these films in my next life, but I certainly hate them in this one."
Two kiwis,"Apr 19, 2000",N/A,"is definitely worth buying because it features recent interviews with all the key figures including Gregory Peck. You also get to see Scout and Jem, all grown up.I expect this film continues to be used in schools as a platform for discussion of contemporary social issues.It would be a shame, however, if the movie were to be used as an simple substitute for the book, which explores a greater number of issues besides that of race. In addition the book nicely employs a couple of literary devices, which, in the hands of a skillful teacher, would be accessible to unexceptional high school students. And of course the story is riveting."
Derek237,"Feb 1, 2003",10/10,"To Kill A Mocking Bird still remains one of the most powerful and thought-provoking movies of all time and there's no surprise why. It's a great movie based on an equally great book by Harper Lee. A lot of parts from the book are missing from the movie but nothing too important so it doesn't take away from the core of the story.Technically Scout is the main character and the story revolves around her, but Gregory Peck really steals the show as Atticus Finch. He is just amazing to watch. I was surprised to read on this site that Robert Duvall plays Boo Radley. I really couldn't recognize him. Still Can't.What else can I say? To Kill A Mocking Bird is a classic. It'll definitely still be remembered in another 40 years.My Rating: 10/10"
kosmasp,"Sep 20, 2020",10/10,"In face of cancel culture, this may take another dimension. As if the theme of charging a black individual and already judging him, before any facts are clear, wasn't enough. Also there are almost no facts except two witnesses who may not be too reliable themselves. But I'm getting ahead of myself. This is about a time, when things like this could happen. Ok, so even in 2020 (and cancel culture aside), they are still happening. Especially with police either not being trained rightfully or having a biased view against the black community.And the current POTUS has not done much to help the situation. Rather the opposite has been the case with him. Attacking BLM and other protest forms that have this as their goal. This movie is a bit of a throwback still and yet for some it may feel like nothing much has changed ... let's hope we'll see the day where this isn't true anymore and everyone can agree it was a dark time. As it is, this is very well played and based on a price winning novel. So ""good"" stuff, if quite harrowing and draining overall. The drama is big in this one ... the actors are marvellous and while Gregory Peck is billed as star, the kids almost steal the show entirely!"
sarah-wardle1,"Jun 7, 2005",10/10,"Fantastic film but book was even better. I was told to read the first chapter only, in my English class at school ( many years ago ) but instead I read the whole book!!!! Next day I was falling asleep at school and the teacher tried to show me up by suggesting I hadn't read the chapter, I stood up and gave a brief summary of the whole book in about two minutes, much to the annoyance of my classmates as they now knew how it ended!! A much deserved Oscar for Gregory Peck though. I don't think the film is shown on television enough though. Trivia: Did you know that Bruce Willis and Demi Moore named their second child after one of the characters in the book - Scout LaRue."
lee_eisenberg,"Aug 6, 2005",10/10,"I saw this movie while I was reading the novel, and the movie did a great job; it was literally as great as the novel. Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for playing Atticus Finch, the lawyer in 1930s Alabama who is defending a black man wrongly accused of rape. The important point is that in the Deep South in the '30s, it was unheard of (not to mention dangerous) for a white man to defend a black man. But the story is told from the point of view of his daughter Scout (Mary Badham), who gets taunted at school; everyone tells her that her daddy defends (N-words). One of the most touching scenes in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is when Atticus has to explain to Scout the whole situation and what the greater ramifications could be.I can't say with words how wonderful this movie is. I think that it was the first movie to deal with the race issue in America (at least the first major one). Some people have said that Gregory Peck's face belongs on a dollar bill, and I have to agree, judging from ""To Kill a Mockingbird""."
johnvondohren,"Jan 6, 2018",10/10,Absolutely perfect movie with a powerful theme of racial tolerance Best movie I've ever seen told from a child's perspective. Thank goodness this was done in black and white; color would have ruined it. The most faithful adaptation of a book I can remember. I cannot say enough good things about it. Watch this movie!
d_crashman,"Jan 2, 2010",6/10,"I downloaded a DVD version few days ago to watch this movie, to see what's all the fuss about. And i simply can't understand what was so great about it, where was ""the moving"" part everybody is talking about? I agree, good acting, some palpitating scenes, but everything moved so fast, one time you're watching the kids how they spent their childhood, the next minute there's his father defending a black man who was accused of raping a white woman, people of which wasn't anything mentioned in the first half of the movie. They just randomly jumped in and started making part of the film. I really cannot understand the reviews of this title, ""a movie which will remain in history"", ""incredibile"", what the hell was so incredible ? Please tell me, i feel stupid. OK, maybe this was a good movie at it's time, with good performances for that age, but its absolutely nothing spectacular compared to nowadays movies. I believe all of the good reviews were posted by old people, who watched this in their childhood and seemed spectacular now to re watch it, but definitely boring by today's standard's. This movie will eventually go down in the years coming, it certainly will. Except for the good acting, absolutely nothing did impress me, 6/10 for the sake of it."
What92691,"Jun 16, 2003",10/10,"This movie is tremendous, outstanding, excellent. One of my favorite movies of all time. I love movies that have a lesson to be learned in them, and this certainly does. The lesson in this one is to not be prejudice, and do not hate, even if there's so much in the world. You probably think I'm gay, since I'm a guy, and my screen names What 92691, which definitely is misfit for talking like this. But I'm a big movie buff, and I realized how stupid the screen name was. I'm surprised this didn't win best picture, but I'm happy it won best actor, because Gregory Peck made one of the best performances of all time. It's a short comment but that was it. I've commented on this recently the only reason I said this again is to see other comments."
shakermaker9t9,"Jul 8, 2000",7/10,"Although the film is quite good, it doesn't touch the book, which is one of the best books I have ever read. Gregory Peck, who plays Atticus, portrays only a fraction of what the book built up Atticus to be, and although it is to be expected several major scenes are left out of the film, like the end of part one of the book where Atticus makes Jem read to Mrs Dubose which I thought were paramount in the character development of the children."
jersey_girl03,"Feb 19, 2002",2/10,"Obviously anyone who thinks this movie is great has not read the book. The book was wonderful and I heard great things about the movie and expected it to be the same.  I was extremely disappointed in the movie.  There were many key things from the book that it lacked.  Aunt Alexandria was one of the main characters in the book and was not even mentioned in the movie.  And the set up of Maycomb was too cluttered.  As many people may think this is just the opinion of one person, I was just expressing my concern in saying that this movie is not worthy of being in the top 50 of all time."
Dan1863Sickles,"May 28, 2004",N/A,"At first glance this movie/book seems like an innocuous little HUCKLEBERRY FINN knockoff -- the pitch is seemingly the same, i.e. ""cute kids battle racism.""But look a bit closer and you see a great deal of smug, fatuous hypocrisy in the way race and class are presented in this dreary, pious and interminable sermon of a movie.Blacks are mistreated. Who's to blame? Why, those no-account white trash Ewells who live down by the dump. Who comes to the rescue? Why those affluent, civilized Finches.You don't need to be a genius to figure out that whatever the Finch family has comes from generations of exploitation and racial as well as class privilege. They are the first family in Maycomb because their ancestors owned the most slaves. Whatever goodwill they feel towards blacks now does not require any self-sacrifice or self knowledge on their part. They have the luxury of doing what's right while holding onto all the privileges their ancestors won for them by doing what was wrong. The Finches don't make sacrifices to end racism, they just punish the Ewells -- the whites who have benefited least from racism do all of the dirty work and take all of the blame.It is for just this reason that this movie/book is so popular with clueless types like high school teachers and liberal columnists. (Hello, Cynthia Tucker! Hello, Anna Quindlen! Hello, Kathleen Parker!) Unlike HUCKLEBERRY FINN, this book lets well to do white folks off the hook by reassuring them that it's only the white trash who will have to pay the price for racial justice.The thing that keeps HUCKLEBERRY FINN controversial after 150 years is that it questions both race AND class privilege. (Wealthy Widow Douglas is just as brutal in her racism as ignorant Pap Finn.) TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a tired, cynical attempt to defend the status quo while pretending to challenge it. As Aunt Maudie puts it (with no sense of irony at all) ""it's the people of BREEDING who must do something to stop this."" The unpleasant fact that it was people of ""breeding"" who promoted (and profited from) slavery in the first place is rigorously suppressed -- and that is why this book is a wholesome classroom favorite while bad boy HUCKLEBERRY FINN remains as dangerous as ever."
cricketbat,"Jan 5, 2024",9/10,"If your only exposure to To Kill a Mockingbird was being forced to read and/or watch it in school, you should watch it again by choice. This is a powerful film. It also manages to convey a moral message without coming across as heavy-handed. The cinematography is simple, but that gives the story and the acting a chance to shine. Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch with a quiet dignity that I hope to emulate in my life, and the child actors both give performances that feel completely natural. To Kill a Mockingbird is a well-crafted film adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels of all time."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jul 28, 2005",9/10,"I always thought that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was nothing more than a court-drama. A predecessor of ""A Time to Kill"" if you like, however the movie turned out to be much more than a court-drama. The movie is truly about and told from the point of view of the children, growing up in the depression-era of the '30's in a small racial divided Alabama town.The story is told beautifully and takes it time to tell the story in a good suitable slow pace. The emotions of the movie are truly gripping and all have a very real, realistic feeling. The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a child makes it even more effective. All the scene's with the children feel very realistic and should bring back some childhood memories. The way their playing outside with each other should is especially recognizable.The movie has several subplots. The scene's with Atticus Finch and his defense of the black man who is accused of raping a white woman is one of them but the movie never looses its focus on Atticus his two children Jem and Scout who truly are the main characters of the movie. The children have to deal with the loss of their mother, their fears and prejudices. The way these things are handled make ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" a powerful and important movie.Gregory Peck is mostly excellent as the ordinary but yet highly admirable Atticus Finch, who besides his own personal problems and that as a lawyer also fights to hide the ugly things of the world for his children. Also really excellent were the child actors. Especially Mary Badham as Scout deeply impressed me. It's no wonder that the then 9/10 year old received an Oscar nomination. Peck received a nomination and unlike Bedham he also got the take the statue home with him. Other Oscar wins for this movie were Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.Also of course worth mentioning is the very good musical score by Elmer Bernstein. This one is among his best work of his lifetime.Is there nothing wrong with this movie? Unfortunately yes, even though I still consider this a classic and one of the most memorable and impressive movies it is not a perfect one. It's obvious that this movie is based on a book and some typical book elements are present throughout the movie that don't really work out the way they're supposed to, such as the entire 'Boo' Radley (played by Robert Duvall, in his very first movie role!) story at the end of the movie. Also the whole 'Boo' Radley thing feels a bit old fashioned and perhaps a bit too over-the-top.A movie that you should experience at least once in your lifetime.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Carma_Gagne_Chan,"Dec 20, 2007",10/10,"This is definitely one of the most important stories ever written, and the 1962 movie was beautifully put together. In my humble opinion as a movie lover, and as someone who saw this movie in my youth, it need never be re-made. It cannot be improved upon, and there are precious few films about which that can be said.I have seen and read many stories about the ugliness and hypocrisy of prejudice. None touches upon the subject more poignantly than this one.The children are prejudiced about a mysterious neighbor, based on fear, not fact.The town is prejudiced about Negroes, based on fear, not fact.I could watch this film every year and never tire of it. This is a movie I will make sure my grandchildren see, and a book I will make sure they read."
christostreak,"Nov 6, 2014",6/10,love to see a new update on this movie. great story great book just need the technology of today and would love to see it in color. people still have this book in schools. at the time of filming i guess this was good but to watch this in a new modern age it is disappointing. only a selected audience would enjoy it. meaning not my generation. this is not something for a movie night or a fun night with family. it is only a movie to watch if you have interest in culture art or books. also if you read the book you would know that you never watch the movie. however if you love classic movies then it is a ten and go watch it. if your an modern person then don't even think of watching it
Red-Barracuda,"Dec 7, 2015",6/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the acclaimed adaption of Harper Lee's novel, which until this year was the only novel the author had written. It quickly became a standard text, taught routinely in schools. Set in 1930's Depression era Alabama, it focuses on a principled lawyer called Atticus Finch, who takes on a case to represent a black man accused of raping a white woman; in the subsequent trial Finch raises serious doubts about the legitimacy of the accusation. The story is told through the eyes of his young daughter Scout.The story is an autobiographical one to some extent, with Scout being a fictional version of the young Lee. It must've been a particularly pertinent film in the 1960's in the middle of the Civil Rights movement, when there were other films addressing the issue of racial discrimination in different ways, such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? (1967). Unlike that one, this one is a little more intense, as it is set thirty years in the past in the deep south, at a time where lynchings were not uncommon. The courtroom drama part of the story actually only occupies a quite small portion of the film, with much of the runtime devoted to character development showing small details of life, both before the pivotal trial and later after the fallout. For me though, it was the court scenes that were the real highlight, with some stellar drama and acting. Of the latter much credit has to go to Gregory Peck, who brings to life Atticus Finch with extreme skill and measured understatement. He was definitely one of the top actors of his day and this film really shows why. The child actors were also very convincing also, which is hardly a given. It was also the film debut of the great Robert Duvall who appears late on in the picture as the mysterious Boo Radley."
ubersleuth,"Aug 23, 2000",3/10,"I've never read the book, but having just seen the movie, I think I will. Not because I was so inspired by it. No, this movie had all the poignancy of a rock.I want to read the book because it has to be at least ten times more interesting than this movie.The story presented is not new. It wasn't new when the book was written. I say this because I think people get swept away by the story rather than by its treatment in this particular case.When I watched this movie I felt lost and detached, not knowing what was going on and why.The music was obtrusive, although it was typical of the era, so I'll give it that. The sets and the costumes were well done, I'll give it that, too. But the only good performance was from Gregory Peck. Everyone else was stilted and forced.The only way this movie can be justified as good is by comparing it to other films made at that time. It seems real actors hadn't yet realized it was respectable to perform their craft on the silver screen, and directors hadn't yet become artists. Even this doesn't totally fly. I have seen great films made then and before (Cape Fear, High Noon), so I know it could have been done well.I fault the screenwriter and the director, and whoever it was who told them they were doing a good job."
allan-costa,"Jul 26, 2016",10/10,"A fabulous screenplay, brilliant performances, masterful direction, beautiful cinematography and production design. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) is one of a kind of an experience in the art of cinema.Atticus (Gregory Peck, Academy Award of best actor) is a lawyer of a small town in Alabama, in a Great Depression era. Judge of town assigns him to defend a black humble man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters, fantastic) unfairly accused for the rape of a white maiden, Mayella (Collin Wilcox Paxton, a well-directed standard actress).What follows is a background for a fundamental Socratic question: Is It possible to be fair, in a unfair city? Question imposes itself in two crucial moments of the story, and it is answered by two different ways, exposing tears of racism and other awful prejudices. Peck is heart touching, empathic, dramatic but not ridiculous. In that very year, his contenders where not less than Jack Lemmon (Days of Wines and Roses), Peter O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia), Mastroianni and Burt Lancaster, a titanic setlist that enlightens even more his (nevertheless well deserved) victory. His speech at court is mesmerizing, one of the greatest performances on screen, featuring only one cut in more than nine minutes. His sons are beautifully lived by Mary Bradham (herself a nominated), and Phillip Alford, bringing even more light to the perfect screenplay.Atticus by itself is not a aleatory name: it means ""Man of Attica"", region of Athens, in Ancient Greece, where Socrate flourished and took the most important step in thinking history, philosophizing about the Human Being, instead of Cosmos. Moral questions faced by the principal character are answered sometimes by himself, sometimes by others, named the scene where his daughter gives to the men of the unfair city a exquisite lesson about to be righteous.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a unmissable movie, a proof of the wonderful transforming capacity of cinema."
leviot,"May 25, 2006",9/10,"Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression-era racism in the south seen through a child's eyes, so the first question that comes to mind about this movie is 'does it do justice to the book?', and the answer is a resounding 'yes!'.Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused Negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villain, Bob Ewell.Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a Hollywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham.In the Two-Disc Special Edition the bonus features include an extensive interview with Gregory Peck, as well as a long documentary about the movie and its production. Almost the entire cast comments on different aspects of the film-making, including Philip Alford and Brock Peters."
PopcornPlease,"Aug 19, 2025",10/10,"I'm betting that many commenting here are either students, wannabe writers (or attorneys) while others are obviously clueless. Those who give this flawless and timeless film a lower rating (it deserves a perfect 10) obviously don't get it, so why bother with their opinions? They aren't exactly deep thinkers even when a story is as sweet, simple, and self-explanatory as TKAM, plus they're used to a steady diet of CGI, superhero movies, and Ritalin. And you just know that some reviewers are like the trashy Ewell characters, the type who'd support a corrupt, orange felon who thrives on hatred and ignorance. Suffice to say, this film should be seen by everyone. It's that good, a true classic. There's a reason why it's still being seen, discussed (and read) 65 years later."
angelina_7586,"Nov 23, 2006",10/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best movies of all time. It may be difficult for others to agree with this statement because many people were forced to watch this moving as part of their high school education. However- the first time I ever watched this film was in grade 10 English class. It has been one of my favourite movies since that very day.I read the novel TKAM when I was very young, with my father. I understood the content of the book and asked my father constantly why Tom Robison was treated that way(I don't want to spoil). Now, I alway judge a film differently after I have read the novel, and usually I'm disappointed in the quality and consistency of the movie. THIS IS NOT THE CASE! Not only was the film true to Harper Lee, but it also took the story to a whole new level. Gregory Peck is at his finest is this film - every child wishes he could have a father like Atticus.This film offers so much more than a good story told by great actors - it allows oneself to look inside themselves, as well as where we have come from as a civilization. It shows us too, how much farther we need to go. As I watch TKAM over and over (I'm surprised the DVD still works) I am able to relate to Scout, Jem, Atticus and even Boo.Any film that is able to invoke so much emotion within myself, portray true heroes with brilliant acting, and have such profound insight, deserves a number one in my books."
Boyo-2,"Oct 6, 1999",10/10,"I can only echo what the rest of the users here are saying - this is one of the greatest movies ever made, without question, and in my opinion, should be required viewing for children.  Peck is magnificent and his Oscar win is one of the best in history, because he gives the best performance of his long and brilliant career."
bootlebarth,"Dec 21, 2008",6/10,"A classic book about a noble theme doesn't guarantee a classic film. I started the DVD with high hopes but found the barely intelligible infantile antics of the first hour almost unwatchable. Did it have to take that long to introduce the unseen Boo Radley and announce an accusation of rape?The courtroom scenes were excellent, as were almost all the moments when those irritating kids weren't running around, slamming doors, being stupid and shouting in high-pitched voices.A child's words on a page, especially if precocious, don't easily translate to moving pictures. The film suffers from its attempts at faithfulness. The story is strong enough without the distractions of playground fights.Fans of the film should visit the ridiculous 'Rotten Tomatoes' review by Emanuel (Mr Moustache) Levy. He seems to think Jem is a girl. He says that Boo is chained to a bed (not shown) and that he has yellow teeth (hard to spot in a black and white film), and that he drools.The issues are important and an enduring embarrassment to the 'Land of the Free' (which was founded on slavery), but that's not enough to qualify the film for greatness. Judge the book on its merits and judge the film on its merits. On the screen, To Kill a Mockingbird would have worked much better as an adult story with the children as bit part players. It had its moments, but those kiddie scenes held it back."
Arkaan,"Aug 5, 1999",9/10,"A classic.  This film was a delight from start to finish.There were several things worth a mention from this film.1. Gregory Peck:  He slips into the role of Atticus Finch with ease.  It was made for him, and he slips into it like a fine suit.2. Mary Badham: A great performance from a child actress.  She is Scout, and no one else could play her.3. The score: Ranked by Movietunes as one of the fifty most definitive scores, it works with this film.4. The direction:  Very subtle and understated, Robert Mulligan did himself proud.I could go on and on about the strengths of this movie, but won't.  If it has one weakness, it is that it seems to go on a bit too long.  But that doesn't make it any less moving."
gavin6942,"Nov 24, 2014",7/10,"Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice.What seems odd about this film is how it was made in the 1960s, looking at the 1930s. What would the same film have been like if it was made in the 1930s? Would the tone be different if not made during the civil rights movement? And, in some small way, did this film help push that movement forward? Now, this is not to say it is a bad film. It is a very good, and very timeless film. Bigotry is not dead, not by a long shot. And the belief that everyone deserves a strong defense should never go away, whether they are guilty or innocent, black or white, rich or poor."
long-ford,"Jan 28, 2009",N/A,"This is a good film but it's hard to justify its claims to greatness. It deals with racism in simple terms, most of the whites are bigots and all the blacks are simple, honest and virtuous types. There are very few lines for the black actors (which is probably a symptom of when the film was made). What is commendable is the acting of the children. Their antics are all naturally believable and they run rings around Gregory Peck, the actual Oscar winner! The courtroom drama is effective but feels incomplete. It doesn't even bother to present the arguments of the prosecution. Watchable but slightly overrated.Overall 7/10"
stimpy_tr,"Oct 13, 2020",8/10,"The film is considered a classic. However, in my opinion it could have been much better. I haven't read the book but I guess the film has some problems with the screenplay. It is like two distinct subjects being forcefully integrated. First is the daily lives of some perky children in a small town, and the second is a lawsuit of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Hence the second one is a very serious subject that still preserves its popularity today. In my opinion, the narrative of the second one could have been elaborated more delicately. For example, when a lot of men came to bust the jail which was guarded only by Atticus, I wonder how he would have dealt with the situation if the children hadn't showed up to interfere in the midnight. As I said, it is like two stories being integrated. It worked somehow because the acting is awesome."
gbrumburgh,"May 23, 2001",10/10,"The warmth and affection generated by Kim Stanley's brilliant, thoughtful narration in the Oscar-winning ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" couldn't capture better the essence of Harper Lee's semi-autobiographical novel.  I could swear hers is the inner voice I heard when I first read this book as a young teen.A woman recaptures a single childhood summer during the Great Depression, a period she recalls with great fondness despite the difficult times. As seen through the eyes of an impressionable tomboy (nicknamed ""Scout""), the story, set in a drowsy, dusty Alabama community, initially centers comfortably around typical adolescent escapades, until the town is jarred by a grown-up incident in which an indigent black man is accused of raping a white woman. Scout's widower father is given the daunting, disputatious assignment of representing the already condemned man.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is exemplary as the father we wished for as a child.  A tower of quiet strength, he is a man of utmost integrity, a steady voice of logic and reason, a man of disciplined, yet tender reserve.  A father you can count on to defend you against mad dogs or pervasive demons that disturb your sleep at night.  Too perfect?  Maybe.  But in that perfection Atticus represents everything we aspire not only in ourselves, but for mankind as well.  He is a reassuring factor that man, in spite of his flaws, is innately good and decent -- his saintliness accentuated by his offspring's loving reflection.  Peck's utter sincerity in this role is never doubtful for a minute.  And for once his sometimes stiff, sobering demeanor meshes beautifully with a character that has become his signature piece.The superbly talented ""young 'uns"", Mary Badham and Philip Alford, play the children Scout and Jem.  They may not have had longevity in their acting careers, but here they make an everlasting imprint with performances so natural, triggering sweet memories of our own lost innocence.  Their simple joys and fears are exquisitely realized and instantly become our own.  They and the late John Megna, as their rather frail, awkward summer-time friend, touch the heart with their simple discoveries, theories and revelations.The trial aspects may seem overblown by today's standard but the dramatic tension and poignancy is not lost.  Brock Peters gives a deeply felt performance as defendant Tom Robinson, a man rife with fear, yet able to muster shaky courage and dignity throughout his ordeal.  On the other side of the coin, James Anderson gives despicable meaning to the term ""poor white trash"" as the bigoted, redneck father of a piteous rape victim, played with neurotic intensity by Collin Wilcox.  Atticus's closing argument and the trial's denouement are only two of many highlights, with Peck's speech one of cinema's most memorable soliloquies.Slow-minded recluse Arthur Radley, who is taunted by the nickname ""Boo"" (a compelling Robert Duvall), serves to represent the fear in all of us...fear of the unknown.  He becomes a phantom-like symbol for those who have ever been unfairly judged or persecuted due to prejudice, gossip, opinion, and/or ignorance.  His final scene with Scout remains etched in my mind.Director Robert Mulligan evokes welcoming sentiment without the saccharine in this sensitive Horton Foote adaptation.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" never fails to open my heart, mind and tear ducts.A triumph of the human spirit.  It is a treasure to be sure."
jamespmadison-52401,"Jun 28, 2024",10/10,"Maybe there was never a father as good and pure as Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, or kids as insightful yet innocent as Jem and Scout. Maybe. But Harper Lee's book does exist, and because of it, we have this perfect movie. Very few movies make me cry every time I watch them. This is one. It isn't a tearjerker. Nobody gets cancer. It makes me cry because it just feels so emotionally true and pure, especially in Peck's scenes with the children, his closing statement at the trial, and final ten minutes. It's just so pure. It's so great it just gets to me every time. I can't imagine this movie without Elmer Bernstein's score, and I certainly can't imagine this movie in anything but black and white."
hrlgold,"Mar 5, 2023",10/10,"A film that movie fans have all seen as well as a film that all people must see. I had to read the book in 8th grade as an assignment for school. I had seen the movie as a kid with my father. As a kid I was interested in the Boo Radley story line. A mysterious character that frightens the kids in the story. Watching it as an adult now, I realize the importance of this movie. The trial of a wrongly convicted black man in the 1930s south. The man that defended him because it was the right thing to do. Boo Radley is an example of why you should not judge someone until you know who they are. This movie will forever be timeless and I advise all people to watch it at least once in there lifetime."
The_Dragon_Reborn,"Jan 5, 2007",9/10,"I guess balance would be the right word to sum up this movie. Be it direction, screenplay or acting, everything seemed to be balanced in this movie. I had read the book before watching the movie and doubted if the movie could live up to the book. But it certainly does. Gregory Peck is as though he was born to play the role of Atticus Finch. More like he's not acting but just living the role. That dash of subtlety needed for the role was perfect, at the same time maintaining Atticus' dignity without coming across as too stern or adamant. I thought he was amazing. The kids did marvelous jobs too. Their acting didn't seem forced or exaggerated. All in all a nice movie to watch. Not to be missed."

James L.,"Aug 5, 2000",N/A,"The basic plot: A weaving of the lives of the Finch family, southern society, and Atticus Finch's attempts to defend a black man in a legal case.The praise: Basically an untwining of depression era southern society , it sets the lives of Scout( Mary Badham)and Jem(Philip Alford) Finch, as they live their lives along the backdrop of depression-era southern society, in which their father, Atticus ( Gregory Peck) must defend a black man in a rape case. A film which presents its setting excellently, it boasts beautiful,crisp,detailed black& white photography. Gregory Peck is at his ramrod peak in a demanding role as Atticus Finch . Everyone else is good too, including Robert Duvall in his debut as Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor. It also shows that logic does not always win over prejudice, as Atticus, a lone individual, does not win the case.It touches the themes of racism and childhood coming-of-age and seeing people for their hearts and not for their outside behavior together, and in a very good fashion.must-see.The flaws: none."
view_and_review,"Jan 18, 2019",8/10,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as a book is unparalleled. The movie is a solid rendition and I suppose that's the best we could hope to get.Gregory Peck was superb as Atticus Finch. He was a picture of stoicism, patience, and forbearance. Atticus is a calm, mild-mannered, cerebral man that is very much out of place in Maycomb County, Alabama but very much respected. Gregory Peck very much embodied that.Almost nothing Atticus does complies to social norms from his child rearing up to his most difficult task of defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. He wasn't quite radical in his counter-societal thoughts and behavior but his subtle stances spoke volumes. Of all of the actor selections his was most spot on."
IWatchTooManyDamnShows,"Jan 17, 2023",9/10,"I'm not American. So while I've heard of the title ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" over the years, I didn't really knew what to expect going into this movie. While some others might have needed to read the book in school, and knew what was coming.So while I read the synopsis, and I assumed it was going to be about the father defending the man from an injustice in court. Which was true to a point. However instead we were seeing this happen through the eyes of the children. Which gave a whole new dimension to the story in my opinion, and made for a really original and surprising (to me) experience. I really loved this movie because of it.We don't even learn what the case is about at first, as the children don't get told. So we as the viewer don't get either. We only know that it's something big, when the kids go along with Atticus (the father) to the suspect's family and see all the worried and serious faces. There are hints here and there, where we as adults can connect the dots, while the children stay naive in their childlike innocence.This is not even a horror movie, well I guess it sort of is considering the court case, but this movie had 2 scenes which really caught me off guard and actually made me nervous. The scene with the kid in the car (you'll know what I am talking about) and when they were walking through the woods. Both really well done scenes where they make the viewer anxious.You know how some of the 'classic' movies with high ratings here seem a bit boring that you'd think the rating has more to do with the production values which could have been great for its time or nostalgia (cough Gone with the Wind cough) but no sir not for this one. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was an amazing experience from start to finish."

-- To Kill a MockingbirdMost of the people in To Kill a Mockingbird are already in the grip of racism. What about the poor minority who are discriminated against? That's the great thing about Finch's lawyer, who knows that the general will has its limits, and is somehow a demon. He stood out and embraced the whole minority with his thin body."
Moviejock,"Jun 19, 2003",9/10,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD; 1962, ROBERT MULLIGAN  (9 out of 10)The film deals with racial relations in the American South in the shadow of America's peculiar institution, about seventy years after its formal demise. It manages to condemn racial bigotry without being preachy or demonizing the victims of culturally instilled racism who are otherwise decent and reasonable people.The leading protagonist, Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck is a father of two (a young boy and a girl), a widower, an attorney and one of the town's most respected citizens, who defends a black man falsely accused of beating and raping a young, poverty-stricken white woman.  At the trail it becomes obvious that the accused is innocent (indeed, that a rape did not even take place), and without directly accusing anyone, Atticus makes it abundantly clear to all who is truly responsible for beating the poor, illiterate woman.The background story is about a mysterious recluse who lives in the home next to Atticus', an obviously kindhearted and generous person who leaves gifts for Atticus' son to find in a rotted-out knot in a tree on the property.The story is sparsely narrated by Atticus' grown daughter in voiceover, so we only see her as a child as she describes her life, the people around her and the events that take place over a period of roughly seventeen months. Ironically, the little girl's older brother has the more prominent role in the story, and since it is he, not she, who is present at some of the story's most important happenings, we must assume that her brother later described these events to her when they were children.This is a story about the magic of small-town life in America and the sweet blessings of healthy familial love in the face of human nature's irrational tendency which drives people to fear and to envy those who are different than ourselves.   It suggests that  loving kindness is our only effective weapon against this dragon though the outcome is always uncertain; that we must be wise enough to see the world as it is and foolish enough to live our lives as if the world were something else."

electronmove,"Mar 21, 2022",7/10,"It's not often you get movies that are actually about purely being a father, but this one manages to get it mostly right. There is some heavy-handed political messaging with the do-no-bad father figure who makes no mistakes and always knows the right thing to say, but it is an enjoyable film to watch for the way in which it shows how deeply children listen to the adults in their lives, especially their fathers."

This movie is outstanding in every such manner, from the nail biting suspense to the excellent music I simply just loved this movie and hope I could share that with all of you. As I was watching this movie I didn't feel like I was actually watching a movie, It felt as if I was there with Gregory and the others the whole time the movie was playing I just felt as if I was reliving the movie! I'm calling out to you all, everyone please watch this movie it's so different, raw, and amazing! I would also like to thank Director Robert Mulligan and of course the author of this great story Harper Lee.Thank You."
atishnramdonee,"Nov 20, 2022",7/10,"Considering that movie was made in the 1962, and that the overarching theme was about Race, I cannot but only take my hat off for this movie. The acting is different from how it's like today, but Gregory Peck's acting was strangely reminiscent to how Amitabh Bacchan played the role of a lawyer defending a rape victim in 'Pink'.This is a movie based on a book I have read a few times over the years, and even if I had always imagined and 'played' the movie in Kodachrome inside my head, I do not feel disappointed by how the characters were played.Of course, this movie does not do justice to the amount of details present in the movie, but it still - nearly 60 years later - made a 30 year old man, cry twice."
Inspector_Tiger,"Feb 20, 2006",1/10,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, for one thing. Atticus was bland and uninteresting, Scout looked nothing like the book describes her, Dill was ugly and loud and annoying, the kids in general were really bad actors, the aunt was nowhere near as evil as she is in the book, etc. The lines were all taken directly out of the book, which is something you never do in a movie unless you want it to go really slowly. The story was centered more on the trial, which takes about three chapters in the book, than on the lives of these kids. The trial itself was actually funnier than moving full of overacting and stupidity. None of the actors sounded southern anyway. The book was actually pretty good; I had to read it in class, and then we watched the movie, and it sucked. The direction was really bad too, and the characters had no depth. I mean, I'm 14 and I could do better. You probably think that just because I'm young I can't appreciate a classic, but this thing just sucked. If people of all ages can't enjoy a movie, the makers have failed in their job. I have no idea how anybody could actually enjoy this or spend money to buy the video."
briankistler,"Aug 13, 2002",N/A,"Quite a few of the Video/DVD stores in my town have the 35th Anniversary version of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" in stock (this came out in 1997).  At the end of the movie there is an excellent documentary about the making of ""Mockingbird"".There were two statements from this documentary, which really impressed me. First, Gregory Peck, then in his early 80s, stated that it was the luckiest day of his life, when he was picked to play Atticus Finch in this film! Second, Elmer Bernstein, who composed the film's music (he was also the same man who composed the alma mater band song for ""Animal House""), explained how he came up with the theme song.  He said that, since ""Mockingbird"" was a story told though a child's eyes, he tried to come up with a tune similar to what children do at a piano (simply playing around, haphazardly, with the keys).  Out of that crude dalliance came one of the most beautiful and touching signature songs (once he magically polished it up with violins and other sentimental instruments).""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is about a lawyer and his children, who paid dearly for his (Atticus Finch's) decision to do what was right.  His acceptance of a case to defend a Black man, falsely accused of raping a local White woman (in early 1930s Macon, Georgia) certainly did extract some HEAVY COSTS on him and his children.  As good and as noble a man as he was (and as respected as he was in his community), this trial and its aftermath turned his household UPSIDE DOWN!  There was a great deal of pain, even before the trial, as well.We see the Finch family, at the end of the film, picking up all the shattered pieces and moving on with their lives, as best they can.  We see Atticus, every bit as much the loving and dedicated father that he was throughout the entire story.  This is why (for me, anyway) the very touching and moving theme song is like a song of TRIUMPH and COURAGE  (as they prepare to move into the next chapter of their lives).What a wonderful father Gregory Peck's Atticus was (especially as a widower, and a very busy lawyer, raising two children).  Of all the moving and powerful interactions he had with his children, what impressed me most was how he reasoned with them as if they were little adults (rather than ""children"").  He never seemed to talk down to them.  He tried to talk (and negotiate) with them, as he would with one of his peers (a very interesting irony, since both children called him ""Atticus"" rather than Dad or Daddy!).I was also quite mesmerized by Peck's dramatic voice in the courtroom; especially when he was giving his closing arguments for the defendant.  In addition I was quite struck by the statement of one of his neighbors (to his son, Jem):""Some men are born to do our unpleasant tasks..........Your father is one of them!""In a small way I saw a symbolism of Christ, when I heard Atticus described that way.  Though he did not die for doing what was right, it took an incredibly heavy toll on him and his loved ones.The first time that I saw this movie, I was with a family member who felt uncomfortable about watching it.  Her reason for feeling this way was because she thought that it would be ""depressing"" to watch something about racial strife between Blacks and Whites.  I come away with so much more than that, every time I watch ""Mockingbird"".  I would venture to say that it is my favorite movie of all time!"

I just love when they include the exact lines from the book. It warms my heart.The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of Calpurnia and her relationship with Jem and Scout and the lack of the final phrase of the book, which was a greatway to end it all.Even knewing what happen I got emotional and got chills while watching it. I will watch it again in the future and definitely re-read the book."

Thunderbuck,"Mar 22, 2004",10/10,"...and I see a LOT of movies.  There are so few films that transcend merely entertaining or provoking thought and actually make a difference to at least some people.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one of them.When I look at movies, I frequently look at messages and values.  A movie doesn't HAVE to have these (AIRPLANE! is also pretty high on my ""all-time"" list), but to be considered truly ""great"", I think there has to be some substance.Some of the messages in TKAM are fairly obvious: Jim Robinson's trial displays the ugliness of racism, and Boo Radley shows how easy it is to misjudge people and dismiss them.  But there are more subtle, richer, messages as well: Atticus Finch doesn't just love his children, he respects them; Atticus also demonstrates by representing Jim Robinson that a good man isn't just ""good"" for some and not for others.The messages in the film--even the most obvious ones--are presented with an air of dignity and understatement, many through Gregory Peck's character of Atticus.  The characters are believable (Jem and Scout rank among the most unaffected child performances ever captured on film), and they present a marvellously moving story.I consider myself a fairly sophisticated film-goer, and I have my favorites among foreign film, documentaries, action flicks, and even animation.  But for me, To Kill a Mockingbird is like an old, dear friend due to its sincerity, and its charm."
Psychic_htz,"May 13, 2003",9/10,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, To Kill A Mockingbird deals with the serious issues of racism and tolerance.  Told from the perspective of a 6 year old girl the story is told with innocence, without bias and without obvious moralising which can easily plague a film dealing with such sensitive issues.  It is simply a good story well told.Peck's performance is solid.  As is that of the supporting cast, including that of the children who, although extroverted, never seem overly precocious or annoying.The movie starts slowly but, after the introductions and scene setting, it picks up nicely and should keep most all movie fans entertained.A satisfying movie experience.  9/10"
christian-tesfaye,"Jul 26, 2013",7/10,"Most summaries for this movie say that this is a movie about a white lawyer that defends a convicted black man. Well, this can't be far from the truth. This movie is about Atticus Finch and only him. most other characters are introduced just to show how heavenly the man is.Of course the movie is very joyful and should be commended. Gregory Peck puts on a performance that we never see this days. Their is absolutely nothing that signals his an actor and not Atticus Finch. the photography is breath taking and i am thankful that the movie was shot in black and white and not in color because i think i would have barfed if it was in color.But is is the things that the movie is insinuating that i just don't get. Who is the mockingbird? Is it the black man? Is it Boo? Early in the movie we are told that mockingbird are the only kinds of birds that shouldn't be shot because all they do is good things for us. Are we supposed to believe that the black man or Boo shouldn't be shot because they are creatures like mockingbirds that shouldn't be harmed simply because they know less and do everything for the benefit of others???I have decided to watch the movie another time again but for now all i feel is a 7 out of 10."

jhkp,"Jun 16, 2013",5/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird is not a bad film, but it's pretty overrated. Apologies to the fans.I'm amazed Gregory Peck won the Academy Award. He took what seems like a great part, on paper, and managed to give a stiff, heavy (though convincing) performance, in my opinion. This guy once had a great deal of looseness and charm, as in: The Yearling (1946). Is Atticus such a paragon and saint that he has to be played with clenched jaw and stiff neck? I would have liked it if he loosened up occasionally. I just felt Peck was playing one note throughout. I hate to say he was bad, but I felt he was verging on it. I read somewhere that Harper Lee originally wanted Spencer Tracy. Though I suppose Tracy was a bit too old, by then, he had the ability to humanize saintly characters. (Meanwhile, Universal wanted Rock Hudson, their biggest box office star.)The children are natural, but not especially great actors. Alice Ghostly is good, though her ebullience seems toned down to fit in with the ""Playhouse 90"" acting style that pervades everything. Robert Duvall is good. The various supporting players are all commendable but without much presence. They seem to underplay to the point of fading into the background. Maudie, Calpurnia, etc. Then in the courtroom we get some overacting.I can't put my finger on what I don't like about the film, overall, but I just think it's not altogether life-like. I also wish it had been shot on location; I think a lot of atmosphere could have been achieved. The set, which was completely constructed on the Universal back lot by a brilliant art director, Henry Bumstead, is quite an achievement. But no set has the same ""life"" to it that a real location has.This isn't a bad film, and of course it has its touching scenes (with several moments greatly enhanced, emotionally, by Elmer Bernstein's score). I just don't have the same reaction to it that many others seem to have."
Nelle_Macbeth,"May 31, 2003",9/10,"This is a brilliant adaptation of my favourite novel. Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird has lost very little in the film version and lives up to the book.

gigotu,"May 23, 2003",10/10,"This is my favorite movie ever. I think we are all often greatly impacted by movies we see at a certain age. I was about 10 the first time I saw To Kill a Mockingbird (I had already read the book twice), and I have probably watched it 15 or so times since then. It is really 2 movies in 1. First, it is the story of Jem, Scout, Dill and their childhood in a small depression era southern town. Second, it the story of Atticus and Tom Robinson, and the relationship they developed during Tom's trial.The musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most effective scores in developing the mood of the movie. If the scene near the end of the movie where Jem and Scout are walking home after a Halloween play at their school doesn't send chills up and down your spine, then you must have been de-sensitized by the packaged horror techniques of the modern horror flicks.Unfortunately, in this day of special effects and movie gimmicks, a movie like this will probably not have the same impact on an impressionable child like it did on me. And that is very sad."
hhurtado,"Jan 15, 2004",9/10,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRDAlthough I am not a huge fan of trial movies, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was a very different and amazing movie.  To me, this movie was really realistic in that it shows us a little bit of the prejudice that the United States lived back in the 1930's. All students should watch this movie to have a better understanding and learn the importance of fairness and treating everybody the same way. That might be a good method to learn more about realistic fiction.After seeing the movie I understood how important it is to acquire knowledge about different themes that directly or indirectly can affect us. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is an excellent movie that was pretty much like the book, written by Harper Lee. It is a realistic film that includes idioms and symbols to give to the audience a better idea of the book and also a better understanding.  The movie emphasizes in the trial scenes but also in the history that was going on with the children and Boo. It gives us an idea of how different the world of the kids is and makes us understand that even though they are children they also understand what is going on around them and with the innocence and truth they can make adults understand them. The characters of the movie were definitely well played. The actors were really into their roles and made all scenes to be realistic to have an impact on the audience.The movie counts with an amazing group of actors that   portray their characters in an excellent way. However, the actor that I liked the most is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch; who is a great person full of grace, greatness, style, and more. to me the most important virtue is his immense humanity. Gregory Peck was a person that knew how to treat people and was always worried about others. All his efforts brought him to the Kennedy Center Honors in 1991 where he was honored for all his achievements in life. People close to him showed love and respect to this great actor who taught us that we have to have a great heart to succeed in life like he did.Although I really liked the movie TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, in my opinion there are many things that I would definitely change to make it even better. Something that I think is really important is to include the scenes from the book that were left out, like the part were Mrs. Maudie's house got on fire or when Jem damaged Mrs. Duboses's garden. Personally I think that it would be more interesting to the young audience if the movie were in color, so definitely I would make it in color to attract people's attention and make them interested about the movie. The characters were well played by the actors but over all I would change some of them for others that I think would do it better and more realistically. Making changes in a movie is not an easy thing and might work or not. Some people would think that the changes you made were really good and you would really see the difference but you also have to be prepared to be rejected and criticize, even though those are some changes that I think would work for teenagers.Rating the movies you see is really important because it would help you to know what kind of person you are and what type of literature are you inclined for. As reader of the book I can compare it with the movie and I rated it also as a viewer. The movie shows the most important things of the book and emphasizes really well on the main ideas of it. They use good vocabulary that is easy to understand and itself explanatory, helping the viewers with symbolisms and idioms that are in the book. The movie is definitely better for a person that prefers it instead of a book, however it is very important to read the book first and then watch the movie to compare and understand better.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great movie that teaches us a lot about life; it shows reality and cruelty that makes us change our way of thinking. Racism and prejudice are present in our society, not as in the 1930's, but still here. I think that by watching this movie everybody would understand that life is hard to live in a society that rejects you and discriminates against you all the time without a valid reason, so I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. you will have goose bumps."
Elizabeth-328,"Jun 28, 1999",10/10,"Actually, I do!  This movie is amazing!  It not only features Gregory Peck in an excellent Oscar winning role, it also features other great actors and actresses.  Gregory fits the image I had of Atticus Finch while reading the book.  If you've never seen ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", 'it's a sin'!  This great movie gets a 10 out of 10 every time.  It's a classic."
seeleyal,"Apr 22, 2017",10/10,"This movie is nothing short of fantastic. I read the book at some point in high school and really loved it but didn't quite understand the social significance as much as I do now. The movie adaptation did the book justice and I love both of them just the same. The actors in this film are fantastic, especially the child actors. Child actors always leave me amazed that they are so young yet so skilled. They made me feel like I could relate to them and reminded me of my own childhood. The movie is focused around such serious issues that the parallel story of the kids and Boo Radley adds just enough innocence and mystery to make it appropriate for most audiences. I've always admired the crisp image this movie has despite it being in black and white. This possibly may be due to some sort of remastering but I'm still impressed. Also, I took note of the audio not sounding drowned out like some older films do. The audio was just as crisp as the cinematography. All in all, this movie gives me the feeling that it was filmed recently and the issues it discusses are, unfortunately, still relevant today. I would definitely re-watch this many more times."
steiner-sam,"Dec 23, 2024",7/10,"It's a period drama about growing up in 1932-1933 in small-town Alabama from the perspective of six-year-old Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) and her ten-year-old brother, Jem (Philip Alford). Their widowed father, Atticus (Gregory Peck), is the town's unusually liberal lawyer. Their African American maid, Calpurnia (Estelle Evans), goes home to her family in the Black community at night. A seven-year-old friend who visits in the have violent tendencies called Boo (Robert Duvall). A widow, Maudie Atkinson (Rosemary Murphy), lives across the street and has a close relationship with the Finch family.The first half of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" focuses on the children's adventures. Judge Taylor (Paul Fix) asks Atticus to defend Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), an African American man accused of sexually assaulting Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox), the eldest daughter of Bob Ewell (James Anderson), a racist alcoholic. The film's second half focuses on the trial and its dramatic aftermath. We also meet Sheriff Heck Tate (Frank Overton) and District Attorney Gilmer (William Windom).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is brilliantly cast and has a rich emotional story. It won many prizes but has suffered some over time as parts of the script no longer sound plausible. Atticus Finch's closing argument to the jury sounds more like the 1960s than what a prudent lawyer would say in 1933 to save the life of an African American man who is clearly innocent. It was too high-flying for speaking to a jury of uneducated men with an apparent racial bias. The whole ending drama with Scout, Jem, and Bob Ewell felt implausible.It was neat to see Robert Duvall's first (silent) role in a film; he remains one of my favorite character actors. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" truly belongs to Mary Badham and Philip Alford. They are outstanding. But the movie's ""White Savior"" angle does not age well."
danielcbartlett,"Oct 14, 2008",1/10,"Who did the casting for this movie, really? Its like watching a bad school play, I had to cover my eyes up in so many scenes to stop myself from cringing. I have seen adaptations of this great book performed better in local theatres.Is this another case of the emperors new clothes? I think so. Guys, come on, could you really see any of the actors in this film passing an audition even for a daytime soap opera.The story is great, but thats because the book was so well written, so we can't give this movie credit for its brilliant plot. So we judge it on its acting, screenplay and cinematography.Plot 10. everything else. 0 Read the book."
jeida,"Dec 4, 2000",N/A,"This is an old movie about a young girl growing up in the south.  Her father is a lawyer involved in what turns out to be a very interesting side plot. Yes, a side plot.  I know this movie is touted as being about an important civil rights trial during the depression, but the film is all hers.This is a coming of age film that will make you wish you lived with her and her brother while you were growing up.  The book, ""To Kill a Mockingbird""(1961) by (Nelle) Harper Lee, paints a perfect little picture of home life.  The movie lets you slip into that black and white house without feeling the transition.  There is enough tension and adventure to keep things interesting though, this homestead is only a backdrop for the happenings all around their old fashioned suburb.Comparing movies to the books that came before them is getting old. But a comparison in inevitable.  While watching this movie I was given the luxury of revisiting  these characters again, without many of the familiar complaints that usually accompany a made form a book movie.  The movie is indeed, as interesting as the novel.  And furthermore, the movie is well worth seeing on it's own merits.  Which, by the way,  include Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the Academy Awards, a 1961 Pulitzer Prize winning book to inspire a screenplay from, and a warm involved story with very enduring characters.  The movie is well worth seeing period.You will find this one in the ""Classics"" section, so go there and get it. Those old movies only rent for a dollar or so, and this one is worth a New Release price. But all in all, if you are going to a deserted island any time soon, bring the book if you have to choose one or the other.  It just has more time to give you the feeling that made both the book and the flick so worth your time.  And it's in colour too."
tavm,"Feb 20, 2008",10/10,"In commenting on African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1962 with the release of the movie version of Harper Lee's novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The crux of the story is lawyer Atticus Finch's (Oscar-winning performance of Gregory Peck) defending black farmer Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against the testimony of Mayella's (Collin Wilcox Paxton) accusation of her rape by him. These scenes are some of the most touching and intense I've ever seen of a movie made while there was still a Production Code in effect (though the rules of that Code were relaxed by this time compared to the '30s and '40s). Peters' testimony and, especially, Peck's closing statement were especially touching. Since we're talking about black performers, here's a few more I'd like to mention from this movie: Estelle Evans as Peck's housekeeper for his kids-this actress is the sister of Esther Rolle from ""Good Times"", David Crawford as Tom's son David, Jester Hairston-who I remember from ""Amen""-as Tom's father Spence, Kim Hamilton as Tom's wife Helen, and Bill Walker as the Rev. Sykes who says perhaps the most famous line in the movie, ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing."" (I had earlier misquoted this line in a review of the ""Our Gang"" comedy, Young Sherlocks, which starred his wife, Peggy Cartwright, as a child) Others in the cast are Kim Stanley who's Scout as an adult in narration, Alice Ghostley and William Windon in their film debuts, and, as the children, John Megna-brother of Connie Stevens-as neighbor boy Dill, Philip Alford as Finch's son Jem, and Mary Badham-whose brother John would become a movie director-as Finch's daughter Jean Louise, better known as ""Scout"". Then there's Robert Duvall in his scene stealing turn as the silent Boo Radley. What else can I say about this movie produced by Alan J. Pakula, directed by Robert Mulligan, with screenplay adapted by Horton Foote except this is one of the best ever made in my lifetime! Everyone I've just mentioned was just superb and the score by Elmer Bernstein was a most wonderful addition to this great movie from 1962. Kudos to Ms. Lee for the only novel she ever published that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences I've ever had. So on that note, I definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird."
ARMENPANDOLA,"Mar 24, 2019",9/10,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, AGAINThe movie, To Kill A Mockingbird, is being re-released in movie theaters on March 24, 27, 2019. Originally, it was released on Christmas Day, 1962, based on the best-seller of 1960 written by Harper Lee.Directed by Robert Mulligan and written by Horton Foote, the movie closely follows the book's plot - Scout, a six year old girl, and her ten year old old brother, Jem, live in a small southern town in the 1930s with their father, Atticus Finch, an attorney. Their mother died when Scout was only two and neither child has clear memories of her. During the summer, a young boy, Dill, joins Scout and Jem to explore the neighborhood, and, especially, the home of a mysterious character, Boo Radley, a young man kept in isolation by his father.The opening title sequence, created by Stephen Frankfurt with music by Elmer Bernstein, is one of the best ever done in film, setting up the adult story told by children.The book is narrated by Scout and the movie makes a virtue of this by having an adult woman, voiced by Kim Stanley, narrate throughout as the adult Scout. Stanley's voice and the beautiful music of Elmer Bernstein create an atmosphere that is difficult to resist. Much like the beginning of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams, the movie sets a tone that is intoxicating - it is a memory movie. It tells us of a time past, when things were different. Or so we imagine."

dioriocrimefamily,"Jun 20, 2005",10/10,"In my literature class in eight grade (I'm now a freshmen in high school) we read To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. I loved the book but I like the movie even more. The part I liked most of the movie was Gregory Peck's stellar performance as Atticus Finch. Peck really became Atticus for the role. I think this is Greg's best acting role. It really pays homage to the book. Also it is the first role for Robert Duval as Boo Radley. It is a simply fantastic film and deserved it's Oscar. A must see for kids and adults alike. It is a movie for any people of any ages, it deeply touches your heart and makes you want to be a better person.I highly suggest watching it"
TomC-5,"Nov 26, 1999",10/10,"I've just watched this movie for a second time and was reminded of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. The pivotal moment in which the jury returns with its verdict is still a stunner. Released in 1962, but set during the Great Depression, this dramatized depiction of the noble attorney Atticus Finch, his family, and the community in which he practices his profession offers a (still) powerful and necessary indictment of racism as consisting of an entire social system. Just about everything about this film is superb, including the acting of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch (for which Peck won an Oscar) and Mary Badham and Philip Alford as his children, Scout and Jem, along with the remainder of the cast. The direction by Robert Mulligan also heightens the drama.What really worked for me here is that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD generally offers us three dimensional characters (though Boo Radley was not very well fleshed out, and the ending, in which he figured rather prominently was perhaps the film's weakest moment). Like the good courtroom drama that it is, it gets underneath the characters so as to uncover something hidden about them; in fact, as Atticus says more than once to his children, it is necessary to get underneath another's skin so as to be able to understand them. But as a tragic depiction of what the sociologist Gunnar Myrdal called ""the American Dilemma"" (i.e., a very deep rooted racist social system), it shows us persons who are complex, who are in some senses victims of their own thwarted ambitions and years of poverty's hardship, and who are capable of both lynch mob irrationalities as well as acts of justice and reciprocity. Even the highly moral Atticus seems to recognize his own limited capacity to do much toward changing this world to which he is tied. Some of the more poignant moments also come about as his children, particularly Jem, come to see the world as it really is, i.e., populated with weak beings who commit acts of grave injustice."
richardchatten,"Apr 18, 2025",10/10,"Every author should be as lucky as Harper Lee at seeing her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel made into such an accomplished piece of filmmaking; just as Robert Duvall arrived with a bang - albeit a quiet one - as Boo Radley, never actually seen in the original.A further ambiguity in the original ironed out is the gender of Scout, since due to the narration by Kim Stanley the audience immediately knows that she was a little girl; as like the author she went by a non gender specific name, and when I originally studied this book for 'O' Level English it wasn't until Atticus addressed her as 'Jean Louise' that I realised that the novel was told by a little girl."
o_levina,"Nov 6, 2001",10/10,"I was happy to find a lot of positive comments about the film I value so high; nevertheless I think it's underestimated. Indeed, it's not only one of the greatest movies ever made, it's a movie which can not come out of date. I would disagree with `Smatysia' from Houston: `The heroic liberal fighting injustice' is a theme whose time has not yet passed. A number of prejudices still live and there are still `a lot of ugly things in this world '. Though such cases as described in the story are impossible nowadays, it's the reason not to forget that they were possible ones, but to be proud of the society's development. We must be very careful and try to understand people considering things from their point of view (`You never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them'). My words may seem naive, but the film does not. It's very intelligent movie without becoming preachy or otherwise sentimental. You come to understanding what is right or wrong simply by sympathizing with the heroes of the story.  Furthermore, it's a wonderful example of educating children rightly. Gregory Peck creates a splendid image of Atticus Finch, honest, dignified and courageous lawyer as well as wise and tender father, who is able to explain anything. I can do otherwise but admire him. The scene in the court is especially powerful; it moves me every time I watch it. On the whole, the film is interesting and charming with masterful camera work and beautiful music. The scenery really gives you a sample of what life was like in Southern states during the Great Depression. Children actors are fantastically good. They are so natural, you feel as participating in their small adventures, fantasies, new experiences and impressions.  I would recommend this film to all  youngsters and adults. It's an unparalleled story about right way of living in the world and keeping your head high in spite of prejudices."
Prince-P,"Feb 19, 2024",7/10,"The American novelist Harper Lee was born in 1926, in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama. There, she spent her entire childhood, usually in the company of her same-age neighbor (and best friend) Truman Capote. So, when Harper Lee made her literary debut as an adult, it was with a depiction of growing up in the Deep South in the 1930s. A story built around family and friends, about adults' attitudes towards race and class seen through the eyes of two little children. Harper Lee named her book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".To everyone's surprise, (not least Harper Lee's) ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" became a great sales success. When the book also won a Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1960, Universal Pictures decided to buy the movie rights. The studio picked one of the foremost masters of TV drama, Robert Mulligan, to direct. Then Gregory Peck was asked to do the leading part as Harper Lee's father. Now, it was just a matter of finding some kids who could play the film's important child roles.The shooting wasn't without complications. Because Monroeville, where Harper Lee's story took place, had changed so radically since World War Two, the film's production manager had to scout for locations more reminiscent of the Deep South in the 1930s. Since the abandoned town he found was going to be demolished anyway, he had most of the houses moved to the Universal back lot in Hollywood. When Lee visited the set on the first day of shooting, she was amazed that everything looked so much like her old hometown.After the film's premiere, an almost unanimous body of critics praised the director and his cast for their effort. Harper Lee said that the movie managed to keep the spirit of her original story, and Gregory Peck stated that it was his favorite work (and the picture for which he is best remembered). ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" has since become as much a part of the American myth as Huckleberry Finn or Tom Sawyer."
howlandowl,"Nov 17, 1999",5/10,"Overall, only an adequate job of adapting the novel. The movie is far too faithful to the book to remain cogent as a movie.  The vignettes are done very well, but there is no real sense of the sequences building towards anything. The acting is quite good and Gregory Peck is absolutely resplendent as Atticus Finch, although his dramatic speech is overwritten."
qtisabel,"Jun 25, 2005",N/A,"Oh my gosh! This so called movie was such a bore! There was no point at all! Our teacher made us read the book, and then the movie, and I often found myself either dozing off, or doing something to amuse me while this sad excuse for a movie was playing in the front of the class. I mean, the girl who played Scout made me want to strangle her alive because her voice was SOOOOO annoying! Jem was so stupid and can't even hold a scene if his life depended on it! The only good actors would have to be Miss.Mayella Ewell, and Tom Robinson...THAT'S ALL!! Two actors outta the whole entire movie! Yes there's racism in the South, but we don't need to learn about it through some stupid movie. I'd rather eat dirt than watch that ""movie"" again! So if you haven't seen this long, black and white, sad excuse for a movie, save yourself a couple hours and do something that's actually worth your 80 years on this planet. I give this movie that seems like its made by children a negative 100."
joncheskin,"Oct 21, 2015",9/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird, based on the novel by Harper Lee, is a movie that is iconic, on the order of the Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. Unlike these other movies, the subject of this movie is the deadly serious topic of racial injustice. The movie and the book highlight the perverse nature of this injustice be letting it be seen through the eyes of children, the main characters. Their ordeal of witnessing the (most likely) unjust prosecution of a black man for rape represents a fall from innocence for the kids and a stark commentary on the sick nature of American racist society.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film. It accurately depicts human nature both at its most virtuous and most ugly. Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, an amazing character that lets us believe that we as human beings are capable of great compassion and love. Peck understates it but plays it with great passion, and the effect is extraordinary. On the flip side, James Anderson plays brilliantly Bob Ewall, a drunken bigot of the type we know that most likely beat up his own daughter and blamed it on Tom Robinson, the luckless defendant. The child actors, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, playing Scout and Jem, are terrific and take us along for their trip out of innocence.In my view, the most important thing about this movie is that it stands beautifully on the cusp of a key battle of ideas in the 60s-- the question of whether racism in any form is justifiable. The film is iconic because it provides a strong answer--NO."
billcr12,"Apr 10, 2012",9/10,"Harper Lee is the literary equivalent of the musical term one hit wonder. Her fictional book was faithfully adapted and is still considered a classic in both genres. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, a lawyer in segregated Alabama of the 1930s; or the good old days. His two children, Jean and Jem, are typical kids, running around the neighborhood playing with friends and living comfortable lives.All is going smoothly until a black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of raping a teenage white girl. The racial antagonism is vicious and an innocent man is railroaded despite a vigorous defense by Atticus. His son and daughter are in the courtroom as their father wishes to teach them a lesson about fairness and the evils of prejudice. The town turns against the barrister for his work on behalf of a colored man.Gregory Peck was the best possible choice for the lead role and he deservedly won the Academy Award for best actor. He gives a towering performance. To Kill a Mockingbird is great achievement in filmmaking."
cbrownbrown,"May 5, 2005",10/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird remains one of the best movies ever made. Although some liberties are taken with certain characters in the story, the movie continues to compliment the novel. As I read the book with my ninth grade students, the images of Atticus Finch, Scout, and Jim appear in my mind and my thoughts are associated with the actors in the movie. A then young novice, Robert Duval, becomes Boo Radley. The timely message of the novel and the important events that surround its conception make this movie a classic in every sense of the word. The trial of the Scottboro Boys comes to mind, and I can't help but think that Harper Lee reviewed the headlines and knew the story well. Certainly, we are all obligated to remember the details of that injustice in conjunction with the ever present lesson of To Kill A Mockingbird, ""Injustice exists, and it is hopefully never forgotten or forgiven."""
nooks-07248,"Dec 22, 2018",10/10,One of my all time favorite movies which I recommend to all. A true treasure worth seeing again and again.
Torontoman224,"Sep 8, 2024",7/10,"Good classic film. The other character dominating the movie is 'Scout', Atticus' school-age daughter, who seems like she would rather be a boy at times. Her adult character (never seen on screen) acts as a narrator, quietly reflecting on and interpreting some of what we see. 'Jem' is Scout's older brother. Jem and Scout's mother had passed away previously and there is a touching scene early in the film where the children quietly remember their mother and are overheard by Atticus. At the same time Sheriff Tate arrives to offer Atticus the most difficult case of his career -- that of Tom Robinson. Tom is an African-American and race relations in the 'Deep South' is another major theme of the film. Tom has been accused by a white woman, and will face a white judge and white jury. Some might say that the movie points to social inequalities and the fallibility of our judicial system."
benbelfield0,"Apr 14, 2015",7/10,"To Kill A Mockingbird was fairly engaging considering it was a movie that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch, although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the movie. I'd say give it a watch unless you aren't interested in black and white or old movies."
toll-8,"Nov 16, 2011",N/A,"I watched this film as I decided that it was about time I watched some of the classics that 'Greatest Films of All Time' lists keep raving on about. I have to say after watching a couple of them I feel the list needs tearing up and starting over.To Kill A Mockingbird is a famous book written by Harper Lee. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her writing and I believe that this is the reason the film is deemed a classic as I have to say I found it utterly dull and boring.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a lawyer who looks after his kids alone after the death of his wife. The beginning of the film is from the point of view of his daughter Scout, who plays in the street and has a good relationship with her brother Jem. They have a belief that a man who lives down the street is actually insane and they taunt this man by sneaking onto his property and banging on his door. The fun of being a youth hey. Their fun soon changes though when their Dad is offered the job of defending a black man who is accused of rape. Due to them living in a racist era the town's folk don't take too kindly to Atticus defending a clearly 'guilty' black man and they intend to make his life hell. Their kids fight Atticus' kids, they lynch mob the police station and threaten Atticus and they all lose great respect for this man and his family. As the film gets to the trial we see the children losing a part of their innocence as they realise there is evil in this world.The trial scenes are not as tense as they should have been and they take all the attention away from the children. For forty minutes or so they are barely in a shot. Atticus tries to defend the black man, Tony Robinson and although he is clearly innocent he faces a losing battle against an all white jury. Tony is killed after the trial and the father of the man Tony apparently raped, goes after Atticus' children.I won't tell you what happens after as I wouldn't want to give away an ending of a classic, although if you listen to me I wouldn't bother watching it. People will though due to its status in society and I am aware that it conveys a meaningful message, especially for the era it was released in but the whole ending throws out the principal Atticus is fighting at the beginning. The film to me is just a mess. I know the book is a classic and no I haven't read it but that doesn't make the film a good one. It is just plain boring.I had this problem a while back whilst watching another film voted as one of the greatest of all time: Citizen Kane. Oh my, that film must have been the most boring film I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt tears streaming down my face. This wasn't quite as bad but it is one of those classic films that people of today won't get, especially if they are under thirty.I have no problem with the acting in it. Gregory Peck is very good as Atticus and there are a few good scenes that I found myself interested in but very quickly I would be falling asleep again. Maybe I'm not appreciating what is supposed to be beautiful about this movie but to me there is absolutely nothing.Disappointed to say the least but there is one thing To Kill A Mockingbird has taught me, to not trust the 'All Time Greatest Movie' lists that are around unless of course they actually have something about them, like The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Now that is a classic."
lastliberal-853-253708,"Apr 7, 2012",9/10,"With three wins among eight Oscar nominations, this is one of the best pictures of all times. Gregory Peck won one of those Oscars for what is certainly his best performance.It was Mary Badhams first film, and she received a well-earned nomination for her performance as Scout. It was also Phillip Alford's first film. Both of these children performed as well as many actors with years more experience. Of course, Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay, based upon Harper Lee's novel contributed immensely, but the two young actors really made you believe you were watching real characters.In an interesting note, it was also Robert Duvall's first film. He was the ""Boo"" Radley referred to throughout and not seen until the end.The summation given by Peck has to be one of the greatest of all times, and he truly was, in the words of Miss Maudie, ""born to do our unpleasant jobs for us..."" Which, of course, includes reminding us of when we fall from what we should be a humans."

MovieAddict2016,"Oct 21, 2005",9/10,"It is obvious from the opening credits that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is going to be a great film. Competing against David Lean's epic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" at the Oscars in 1962, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" would have been guaranteed Best Picture if Lean's film hadn't been in the race that year.Gregory Peck gives his best performance as Atticus Finch, the southern lawyer who takes on the case of a black man accused of having raped a young white woman.Many town residents accuse Atticus of many things for defending a black man, and his children (Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as Scout and Jem) are even attacked at one point.This is not a happy movie, and in fact for its time it must have been rather bleak. The hero doesn't necessarily win; it is the opposite of the typical courtroom dramas where the protagonist lawyer proves the defendant is innocent and the real criminal is put in jail.Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice to say it's not quite so simple in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Not everything works out the way it should.The direction by Robert Mulligan perfectly evokes the era, mixing the racial intolerance with the peachy-clean familiarity of southern America. Peck's portrayal of Atticus was named by AFI as the #1 movie hero of all time. I don't necessarily agree with this, but it is one of the most memorable performances of all time and my personal favorite of Peck's.The supporting cast is excellent - Badham is very convincing and Robert Duvall in one of his early performances (I believe his screen debut, actually) as Boo Radley is effective also.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is not the best film ever made and I do think some aspects of it have been overrated - I wouldn't say Atticus Finch is the best hero of all time nor would I say this is the most important film of the century, as some have named it. However, I do think it is a very well-made and effective film that manages to translate Harper Lee's story to the screen without losing its heart. It's a film that should be seen by everyone."
wdbrown,"Jan 14, 2002",10/10,"An absolutely marvelous interpretation of the novel, To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic.  From the black and white photography ( lost art) to the perfect casting nothing is missing from this film.The movie opens with a child playing with different items: some carvings, a watch, some foil, and with this seemingly innocent beginning the viewer is caught up in a story that not only reflects Alabama of the 1930's, but the real issues with which we still struggle.  The story and its theme are timeless.Casting is superb.  Always impressive, Gregory Peck was born for the role of Atticus Finch.  The children are perfect, and watch for a young Robert Duvall as the mysterious and touching Boo Radley.A beautifully made film which has long been at the top of my favorite movies list."
nairtejas,"Dec 21, 2012",7/10,"I loved the music. And Gregory Peck is just amazing, looking into the fact that it is the first movie I watched of his. Fabulous performance. Now wonder the Oscar.Now, the direction couldn't impress me nor the screenplay. But the adaptation fares well, though it loses crisp at some points. To Kill A Mockingbird is epic when it comes to the story just like the book. If you have mindset of the 21st century then you might not like this and won;t enjoy this. But let me remind you why it is epic: the story, the peculiar case, the elements of life that are depicted is mind-blowing and even in today, we fail to shadow such unwanted situations, all blame to the lifestyle.WATCH OUT FOR: Gregory Peck!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No | Sex: No | Nudity: No | Violence: No visuals"
lobosalvaje,"Feb 28, 2019",8/10,"To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) can be considered a true work of art, because in it, you can see excellent photography, good lighting, a very good script and a first casting. I envy those who in 1962 could appreciate this jewel in cinemas, because certainly, it is a film that address different issues, including racism, poverty, justice, morals, transports us to our childhood making us children again in clothes of Jem, Scout and Dill, transporting us to our younger years, and confirming that good triumphs over evil. Undoubtedly, To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), becomes one of my favorite movies."
jacobjohntaylor1,"Feb 21, 2019",7/10,This is a good movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It kind of scary. It is a little bit overrated. But it almost live up to hype. It really is almost has good has it is said to be.
Steph-84,"Aug 18, 1999",5/10,"Although the actors did a good job in showing most of the story line, the movie did not show some of the more important details that were in the book. For example the important scene in the book were the white children are challenged in the church was not included.  Calpurnia, and most of the black actors in the movie had next to nothing to say.  This stopped the viewer from getting to know the black people.  The only time a black person gets to say his opinion is in the court.  The killer line, ""The meanest person god ever blew breath into"" was said by the wrong person and lost it's impact. Basically I think that all people should read the book to get a better idea of what Harper-Lee was trying to show in her book.  The movie doesn't reflect this.  Read the book first."
MaggieAsh,"Jan 28, 2007",10/10,"I just saw this movie for the first time. I read the book about a year ago and i am glad i waited to see the movie. Although the movie is a bit different from the book, it is one of the best screen adaptations i have ever seen (along with Mystic River) and i am awed all over again by the underlying message in this movie!I am thrilled that i have to read this again in High School simply so i can make sure i have gathered everything there is to get out of both the book and the movie. This is definitely a timeless classic that will be kept in my collection forever. Even my younger brother who usually has no tolerance for movies like this, much less something in black and white, sat through it and actually got something from it. I would watch this movie 100 more times."
laskinner-124-924636,"Mar 24, 2012",10/10,"I saw this when I was a child at a drive-in movie theatre in Phoenix, AZ (where is was a $1 a car) and I remember it so vividly because even as a young child I understood that what happened to Tom Robinson was wrong. Not because I was precocious but because even as young child I could understand what were the underlying tenants of this movie. The storytelling is straight-forward and yet it plumbs the depths. I didn't know anything at that age about civil rights or the struggle of African Americans. This movie is profound because even if you never had encountered this environment (the South) you would come away with a profound understanding of it in all of its levels and permutations. It has a deceptively simple script that belies it's deep roots and in that way Horton Foote's script truly honors Harper Lee's book. PS--Truman didn't write that book --he would have been the first to claim it --IF he had! It is a genuine, true American movie that never fails to move one by it's deeply human characters and story."
PL1981,"May 28, 2009",10/10,"A British survey once rated the novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as one of the absolute must books you should read while on this earth. I think it would probably not be an exaggeration to say that this is also true of the movie adaptation of this novel -that it is one movie you should definitely see while on this earth The beauty of the plot and script of this movie is that it captures all the heartfelt emotion, passion and depth of the book and conveys it beautifully throughout the film while also exploring the important issues and themes contained in the novel in a way that gets the message across as powerfully as the movie did.I have very rarely seen such an entire cast do such a wonderful job of accurately portraying the characters that were assigned to them from the novel. Each actor and actress in this movie proves adept at making their characters come to life and giving them the same amount of depth and dimension that they do in the novel. Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is so perfect and flawless that it makes the viewer wonder whether he is really acting at all or whether he is just portraying his true character and persona in the guise of a another name and another occupation. I have rarely ever seen child actors as brilliant as the three children in this film -they portray their respective characters with a much greater depth than I have seen in most grown-up actors. The supporting cast equally does not disappoint -from Brock Peter's portrayal of Tom Robinson to Rosemary Murphy's portrayal of Maudie Atkinson to Estelle Evans's portrayal of Calpurnia. I have never seen a movie adaptation of a novel so perfectly castThis is a truly moving, powerful and heartfelt movie that is as challenging as it is beautiful. If you haven't watched this, you are really missing out on something very uniquely special"
