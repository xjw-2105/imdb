venividiamavi-v,"Aug 7, 2019",10/10,"This movie, and trilogy in general, is a cinematic (and literary) masterpiece, and simply refuses to get old. I love this movie so much it's become a tradition to watch the Lord of the Rings series at least once a year! It's just as good as Christmas"
jamiedphilips,"Dec 23, 2015",10/10,"I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!"
diffguy,"Nov 2, 2020",10/10,The greatest tragedy of the human race is that they will never make a better movie than Return of the King.
OttoVonB,"Nov 22, 2006",10/10,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."

terrylarosa,"Feb 11, 2022",10/10,"Nothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters
are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!"
0U,"Feb 15, 2020",10/10,"Wonderful on every level. Love the characters and special effects. One of the biggest, most massive battle scenes ever put on the silver screen. A great end to a monumental epic."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 9, 2011",10/10,"I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Derek237,"Mar 16, 2005",10/10,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10"
danlongino,"Dec 16, 2003",N/A,"Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking."
Servo-11,"Jan 6, 2004",7/10,"This movie could really use an EE -- BADLY.  Characters are just picked up and discarded (Eomer, in particular), Eowyn's battle with the Witch King will, with luck, be expanded.  It was over before I knew it and the editing was shabby.  Too many oliphaunts and CGI, atrocious battle tactics on the part of the Rohirrim (sure, charge into a head of 10 story beasts even though we have bows and arrows and can shoot from a distance - sounds good!), meaningless inventions (Arwen's life tied to Ring, the Arwen ""to leave or not to leave"" flip flop, the Lembas Conspiracy, and that stupid Legolas-Oliphaunt trick), a limp confrontation scene with the king of the dead, no resolution to Saruman (the main bad guy of the first two films, if you've forgotten), and the worst hatchet job on an established fictional character (Denethor, Denethor, Denethor).  Horrible, horrible.  Plus a cheesy bed-jumping scene and coronation where the cheddar flowed in abundance.  It was a mess that I hope the EE will mend somewhat, but there's a lot to fix. A LOT.  A disappointing end to a trilogy that began with a masterpiece in FOTR.On the plus side, David Wenham, Billy Boyd and Sean Astin.  They were brilliant and made it worth spending the money to see it once.  Their performances were true and heartfelt, though Faramir sadly dropped out of the picture because PJ unwisely cut the Houses of Healing sequence.It's not worth the hype and I didn't think this once in a lifetime film event would end so sadly."
athgeo,"Jan 21, 2019",10/10,It is the best movie I can remember I've watched while I was a kid!
Hitchcoc,"Mar 16, 2006",10/10,"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 30, 2023",10/10,"Frodo and Sam continue their desperate journey to destroy the ring, Gollum has his eyes very much on the prize, knowing they cannot possibly get past Sauron's army, Aragorn creates a diversion.Surely this is a contender for the greatest film of all time, I can think of nothing negative to say, it's everything you want in a movie and more. Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.This film truly is one of the best ever made.10/10."
EVON1TY,"Mar 14, 2023",10/10,"This movie made me love Cinema. Some movies mades you love that genre, this made me love Cinema. It's not perfect since there are no perfect movies actually. But this one is the Achievement of being the closest to the perfect for me.This movie is the best movie of the all time for me, clearly. I just gained my Cinema love with this movie. And I watched more than a thousand movies. I watched so many directors from so many countries. My cinema taste changed too much since my first watch of this movie. But this movie is still the best for me, not even a single movie reached to it's level. This is why I think the movie is the best movie of the future also. I don't think my thoughts will ever change.This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable.""You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.""Saruman""Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.""GandalfBoth dialogues from the first movie. One of them telling us evil side is unbeatable and the other one tells we have a Hobbit. Brilliant and the most effective storyline. And they adapted it amazingly well!"
eiratan,"Dec 17, 2003",10/10,"As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson."
bob the moo,"Dec 25, 2003",N/A,"Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum.  Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me."
Onslaught-I,"Dec 23, 2003",7/10,"It is hard to make a fair review based on the shortened version of the movie but I will give it a try.First of all I want to praise the team behind the CGI and especially that of Gollum which is nothing short of perfect. The sound FX crew, costume designers, smiths, makeup artists, sculptors etc are all worthy of praise as well.Unfortunately, all is not well in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth. Many important characters are ill adapted, ill casted and perverted.Take Aragorn for instance, who in the book is a tall, proud and weather bitten man with many hard years of life carved into his body and features; a descendant of kings with great claims to make. In the movies he is of average height, narrow of shoulders and weak of limb, judging from how he moves. His face does not carry the slightest trait of a hard life and his manners are soft and his voice is weak.Take Gimli who in the book is a great dwarven warrior with a passion for hollow halls of stone. In the movies he is perverted into a comic relief character who moves nearly as poorly as a ""real"" dwarf.Take the Ringwraiths who in the book are imposing figures with dark powers that make their enemies shake with fear. In the movies they are a bunch of sissies who get their asses whooped time and again while actively seeking physical confrontations.Take the elves, who ought to be timeless and beautiful beyond words. In the movies they look ordinary and nearly ugly at times.Take the Orcs who ought to be fearful and cruel warriors with their own cultures, languages and conflicts. In the movies, they are killed as easily as bugs and they move as if they were 100 years old and moreover they do not show off any soul or will of their own.I could go on and on forever with a list of such poor adaptations but will end it here. The point is that fantasy is very much about the individuals who inhabit the world and how some are of greater power and stature than others. This is something which Peter Jackson has not managed to bring to the screen visually at all.What he on the other hand has brought to the screen visually is Sauron himself: the greatest power and fear of Tolkien's Middle Earth compressed into first a mail clad warrior and then a burning vagina revolving on top of Barad Dür like a search light. Whether to laugh or cry at this adaptation is up to the viewer. It is pretty much the abc of horror that what you can imagine is a lot more scary than what you can actually see. And this brings us to my next point, the aurals:It can never be stated too many times how important the aurals are for bringing a world to life and drawing the viewer into it. While the sound effects are very well crafted in Peter Jackson's LOTR, the music is not. In fact, the music is so poorly fitting that it spoils the entire experience. It is too ethereal and carries no dynamics or inspiring rythms and where it tries to do so it is more of a turn off than whatever crap the standard radio station is playing. It is altogether pretentious and the only feeling it successfully conveys is melancholy.Another thing that strikes me is how empty the world is. No wild life, no natural beauty but bare mountains, no hamlets or buildings outside of the cities, no roads, hardly any traits of the civilizations of old and no agricultural signs at all except in the Shire. A few cities and the rest is wasteland.The movies can be summarized as technical master pieces but ill adapted, ill casted and musically disastrous."
piratebabe2727,"Sep 25, 2004",5/10,"I cried because they messed this movie up so much! At the end of the movie, I literally sat there bawling because, after reading the books at least 8 times, I was so disappointed by Peter Jackson's direction of the movie. The Two Towers was amazing, it stuck to the books and had awesome battle sequences. In RotK, the battle scenes look copied from the TT, the Paths of the Dead made me think Bloom had brought the guys in from Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie felt extremely long, and there were 8 endings!!! The worst part of it was they left out the Scouring of the Shire... the scene was completely gone. I used to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan, I saw the other two movies at least 20 times and have read the books every year for years. After seeing this, I've completely lost interest. If you enjoyed the book, don't bother watching the movie."

mstomaso,"Nov 30, 2007",10/10,"Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK."

stevethepot,"Jan 10, 2007",10/10,"I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever."
Chris_Docker,"Dec 17, 2003",9/10,"Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . ."
kevin_crighton,"Sep 1, 2005",10/10,"Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!"
jrugg19,"Mar 11, 2021",10/10,"I'm not sure what could be said about LOTR that hasn't already been said, other than that I personally think it's best trilogy ever put to screen, and I really can't think of anything close. Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made."
Greekfish,"Sep 12, 2004",7/10,"I think the Lord of the Ring books are really great, and with a story such as that, and the environments and characters of an awesome tale, you've got that part settled. The actual filming is also impressive, many scenes work really well, but in at the end of the movie Peter Jackson kind of over extends himself a bit. There is crying scene after crying scene, which to me is too much. The ending is very important for a film, and so in my opinion it cannot be given more than a 7.Another thing that bothers me a bit is the academy awards. They mean nothing no more. Even though he might not have deserved them all this year he had to get his 11 awards just to prove that the jury has taste, and to equal it to Ben Hur and... Titanic...(You see what I mean). The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions didn't even get NOMINATED for best special effects. This is probably because they would have had to win..."
evoid,"Jan 11, 2009",5/10,"After I have seen the first movie, when it was shown at the movies, I thought it was the best movie I ever watched. Forgive me, I was a child. Because I could not wait for the second one to be released, I read the whole trilogy. When ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" were released, I watched them in great expectation. My thought on the second part was, that it was different from the books, but it was still great in it's own manner. But the third movie disappointed me. I could not find any sign of the Tolkien-feeling that I knew from the books and that was partially carried on by the first two films.Yes, for sure ""The Return of the King"" is the most imposing one of the trilogy, but somehow it leaks depth. To me it seemed like this movie focused/decreased only on views of great fortresses, huge marching armies and heroic battles. Unlike the previous parts, this movie left me totally cold. I was never feeling inside the happening or feeling with the characters, I never experienced something like catharsis. I can remember sitting in the cinema and being just sad. There was a lot of action, a lot of things went haywire, but somehow it seemed all far too distant. It was like eating something you haven't eaten for a long time and expecting a certain taste, but realizing that in truth it tastes totally different, much more synthetically.I think it's a pity and I hope that one day there will be a non-Hollywood adaptation of The Lord of The Rings."
eviltimmy,"Dec 20, 2003",10/10,"This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that)."
marianstelian,"Dec 25, 2020",10/10,"In my opinion,this is one of the best movie ever, maybe the best."
jzappa,"Mar 27, 2007",6/10,"Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again."
hosr2,"Dec 29, 2003",5/10,"I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development.ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them.Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is.SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.OTHERSThe same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh -  this is kindergarten film production.I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good.Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down."
TomLong0507,"May 2, 2016",10/10,"It's difficult to process something like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: Its very nature defies comparison.There has never been a cinematic endeavour based on a more daunting...or more beloved...literary work. There have never been motion pictures of the magnitude undertaken by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and his production team. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will endure forever as one of the most bold and audacious enterprises in the history of cinema. It is, quite simply, a seminal event. Other projects (for example, a movie filmed in space) are already being considered and may someday be attempted. They may challenge LOTR's logistical complexities (or, at the very least, present a comparable set of obstacles), but it is unlikely the numbers of people involved or the sheer duration of the creative process will ever equal this effort.Jackson & Company have made believers out of millions of readers who doubted the works would ever enjoy respectable translation into a more ""mainstream"" media. They have changed the way production models are approached for large-scale projects. They have forged what may well be the premiere visual effects house in the business (WETA Digital). They have raised the bar for all filmmakers to follow, and reminded millions of jaded moviegoers of one simple truth: Love, attention, and genuine dedication to (and appreciation of) one's material can overcome inconceivable obstacles, and always...always shows on-screen.And now it's over.With the longest running time of any film in the cycle (early indications suggest next year's extended DVD cut will clock in at over 4 hours long), RotK is an all-out assault on the senses. There are times when it is simply impossible to take it all in: Armies of hundreds of thousands clash beneath towering war beasts as deadly, dragon-like bird-things strafe hapless victims on the ground. Mountainsides erupt with pyroclastic fury as lava flows labour to engulf our heroes. This film is off the hook, gloriously so.In tone and ""feel"", RotK rests comfortably between Fellowship of the Ring's penchant for character-centric drama, and The Two Towers' colder, more mechanical ""war movie"" approach. What we end up with, is, in essence, an emotionally charged war movie sprawling in scale yet intimate in heart, its effects are frequently overpowering."
PoIFanboy,"Nov 20, 2024",10/10,"I don't think I have to.repeat this sentence. This movie is perfect. And when I say perfect, I mean PERFECT! The word masterpiece is an understatement for this work of art. Although the Battle of Helm's Deep still is the best battle to ever exist in a movie in my opinion, this is BY FAR my favourite movie. This should be an 11/10 and should be at least at 9.2, so go help this piece of art to get what it deserves, a better rating!The End (and I mean every end) is wonderful, the fact alone that there are several endings inside the ending is mindblowing. Even when the credits roll, it's epic and just pure greatness.I love this movie and you should love it too!"
OboeSaxIII,"Jan 22, 2005",10/10,"Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed ""genius."" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic ""niggling"" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World."
Al_The_Strange,"Apr 6, 2014",10/10,"After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dec 27, 2009",10/10,"I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10"
sniffle_wiffle,"Jun 21, 2010",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie, I won't be reviewing just 'The Return of the King'.I saw the first film 'The Fellowhip of the Ring' when I was 12, and I'm 21 now and I still haven't been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think 'Fellowship' is my favourite of the three, it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog, it is exhilarating, involving and most of all - emotional.'The Two Towers' has the hardest task of being the middle film, but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesn't hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film, culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary, through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real.'The Return of the King' delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing, not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars, it more than deserved it, I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well.Any gripes I have for the trilogy, would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron, and considering that Sauron is the centre of 'The Lord of the Rings' this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are, are so vague and surreal? Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form? This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film, where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material, and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy, especially during the climax of 'Return of the King' where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse! The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films, and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame.As you can tell from what I have said, I love 'The Lord of the Rings', and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear, to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the characters, it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson (just watch the extras), and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors weren't working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing, but of course there are countless others to mention but I don't have time. Howard Shore's score is possibly the best movie score ever, and the films would be nothing without it.Ultimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films, you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens' greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films, first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially 'The Return of the King' which had many vital scenes cut aka. Saruman's last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you, and New Zealand!"
CinemaClown,"Oct 5, 2013",N/A,"Every tale embarks us on a new journey, every journey eventually comes to its inevitable end. As for The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring turned out to be a genre-defining classic. The Two Towers somehow raised the bar to an even higher level. And although it did seem near- impossible for The Return of the King to triumph over such towering expectations but against all odds, this final journey of Middle-Earth delivers everything to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary saga to an epic & magnificent conclusion.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the culmination of the wonderful journey we embarked on with The Fellowship of the Ring & picks up the story right from where it was left off in The Two Towers. The story finds Frodo & Sam continuing their quest towards Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring while the rest of the fellowship prepares for their final battle as the dark lord Sauron turns his eye on Gondor. But in the end, it all comes down to Frodo & the One Ring to decide the final fate of Middle- Earth.Directed by Peter Jackson, this remains his finest directional achievement & The Lord of the Rings as a whole is certainly his magnum opus. Making all films in a trilogy succeed on every scale is no mere achievement but to make the next instalment work better than its predecessor two times in a row is even rarer. And yet, Jackson manages to accomplish exactly that with his sweeping cinematic vision, stunning eye for detail & in-depth knowledge of balancing emotional storytelling with large-scale action entertainment.The screenplay is cleverly adapted from the source material as many right choices were made in the decision of what to include & what to leave out from the final script. Fran Walsh also tries her hand at direction as the opening prologue is her creation. Being the final film in the trilogy, there's a sense of urgency in this chapter but it still ties up all the loose ends appropriately, gives proper farewells to its characters & delivers a high-quality entertainment of such epic proportions that fans couldn't have asked for a better finale.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design adds even more amazing & meticulously detailed sets to its story, the dazzling cinematography further magnifies the visual presentation to make the cinematic experience even more magical and Howard Shore's epic score is filled with tracks that are truly imposing, beautiful & further expand the domain of its predecessors as the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings remains the greatest work of his illustrious career.VFX is once again its most groundbreaking feat, however, this time it isn't a slight advancement but a pretty huge leap. Everything that made its brief appearance in the first two chapters is fully explored in this finale plus the length, scope & magnitude of battle sequences it offers is second to none. Also, with better rendering of its CGI characters & stunning level of craftsmanship in costumes, make-up & sound, The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for visuals in cinema that remains unequaled, as of today, in the scope of how much it contributed to the film's art while elevating the whole story.Despite running at 201 minutes, there were many things which got omitted from the theatrical cut & that's why the extended edition is more recommended. Also, many happen to criticize the last 45 minutes it takes to finally end but if you ever watch The Lord of the Rings in one sitting, then it'll make perfect sense to you because not only is it a reasonably enough time to recover the audience from what is an emotionally draining experience but also provides proper farewells that each one of its characters deserved.Coming to the performances, The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers introduced almost all characters we needed to be acquainted with & The Return of the King simply brings their arcs to completion. Unlike the previous two films in which Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) & Gollum (Andy Serkis) turned out to be the most impressive characters, respectively, there is no single dominating performance in this chapter as its entire cast puts up a more mature on-screen portrayal of their respective characters & never really leaves anything major to complain about.J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is unanimously hailed by critics & readers alike as the greatest fantasy novel ever written & a milestone in the works of literature. And it's amazing that its film adaptation follows the same route in the world of cinema. It did catapult Peter Jackson into the big leagues of Hollywood while also setting up Weta Digital as one of the foremost VFX studios on the planet but where it made its biggest impact is on cinema itself for it changed everything there ever was about epic & fantasy filmmaking, is one of the most important films of the modern era & a landmark moment in the annals of cinema.On an overall scale, The Return of the King is more than just a fitting conclusion to The Lord of the Rings. It triumphs as one of the greatest sequels ever made but along with The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers, it also makes up for cinema's greatest motion picture trilogy that will not soon, if ever, find its equal. An unprecedented achievement in the world of filmmaking that's epic in every sense of the word, The Lord of the Rings, in some ways, is to cinema what its source material was to literature & it is destined to remain a standard by which all future film trilogies will be measured for decades to come."
Fat Dragon,"Dec 16, 2003",7/10,"Well, the trilogy has ended, and it's time for some conclusions. First of all, Return of the King is, IMO, not as good as Fellowship of the Ring. On the other hand, it's definitely better than The Two Towers, which I think is by far the weakest of the three films.All in all Return of the King is certainly a good film, but it's too long, the battle scenes somewhat lack intensity and when it's all over you're left with this lingering ""was that it?"". Don't get me wrong, I like the film, but it does feel as something of an anti-climax. Perhaps it's simply not possible to transfer the enormity and intensity of what's meant to take place to film. The battle scenes are a bit dull, they lack intensity and realism, which is too bad because the battle scenes are in many ways the most important part of the film. To make it all worse (at least as I see it), they try to make up for it with slapstick, kill count and silly comments from Gimli, who is again reduced to comic relief, as well as a tendency to focus on the ""really big stuff"" (TM); oliphants, various trolls and the big siege weapons, instead of really following the battle. Also, I find the constant switching between Frodo and Sam and the battles annoying because it breaks up the battle scenes, jerking you out of the action just as it's starting to pull you in. RotK simply doesn't do a good enough job of making you ""feel"" the intensity of battle. Some movies can almost make you smell the blood, RotK doesn't achieve that, in fact there's hardly any blood at all and often just a lot of CGI (I guess the PG13 rating didn't help in that department). CGI has come far, but battle scenes are still vastly better with real people.Anyway, most of the movie is pretty good, but it never quite achieves ""lift off"" before it touches down on the ground again. As with the Matrix trilogy, the sequels just don't quite live up to the first, although I will say again that I think RotK is a good, although not brilliant, movie, and definitely better than Two Towers. There's no reason not to watch this film and I'm almost certain it won't be as good on DVD as it is on the big screen (mostly because the CGI and FX are so important), so go see it in a cinema while you have the chance. If you say this is the best movie you've ever seen, however (and it's almost a law of nature that some people will whenever a new LotR flick is out), I suggest you see some more movies. (Yes, I find all the LotR fanboys, and -girls, who uncritically love the movies with a zeal unmatched even by the most die-hard religious fundamentalists, extremely annoying)"
jpozenel,"May 28, 2004",5/10,"I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games.  In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion.I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making.  There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning.  Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to.  But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better.  Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised.  This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture.  These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10."
bowmanblue,"Jan 15, 2020",10/10,"It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').Maybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.Yes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.There are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).As I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly."
xiaoli7377,"Apr 11, 2022",10/10,"Note: this is a review of the extended edition of the film.Peter Jackson's trilogy concludes with a terrific finale that makes the near 12 hour long journey we take as viewers one of the most worthwhile cinematic experiences in history. I like to think of the entire trilogy as one long movie-filmed simultaneously but obviously having had to be released over three parts to be profitable at the box office. Much like Tolkien's novel itself, having to be split in three volumes.The quality of production and post-production all maintains its standards across the trilogy. I would like to say that although ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" remains my personal favorite of the three, ""The Return of the King"" being the one that finally brought home the clean sweep at the Oscars is very fitting and deserved.The reincorporated scenes from the extended editions of all of these movies really helps a lot in fleshing out the world of Middle Earth. I can't imagine going back now to the theatrical cuts. A few scenes here and there do slow down the pacing just a bit, but in a movie as grand and epic as this, it's all for the better to extend our time in this unforgettable fantasy world that Tolkien so vividly described and that Jackson so faithfully brought to life on the big screen."
Destiny-1-12-15,"Mar 22, 2022",10/10,"Peter Jackson's ending to The Lord of The Rings. Is the most perfect ending to any trilogy ever in Hollywood history!

dkncd,"Oct 5, 2007",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth.Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together.This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut."
Bulleon,"Dec 18, 2003",10/10,"How superb 'The Return of the King' is. It is the ultimate fantasy film and a sure bet for all the film awards this year. Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed, representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. It's got action, romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. Go and see it now!"
SmashMe55,"Dec 21, 2003",6/10,"OK. First of all, this movie cannot be considered the best movie of all time because of many things. I've read almost every comments on this site about this movie (and i dont exaggerate at all) and all i saw was "" Best movie of all time"", "" The way movies should be done today"", etc, and i thought wait a minute, there's something wrong here. Before anyone becomes insulted by what im saying i have to say that i've read all the books and i loved them. The best trilogy in books history!! But here, what im arguing against is not the story nor the way Jackson adapted it( by the way, it couldn't be much perfect for a lotr movie). I'm just outraged by the ignorance of all the people that are stating that this is the best movie of all time!!! I certainly do not say these people are stupid or something like that, its just that this is not a work of art, a masterpiece. It is just another commercial movie that looks like the others and this movie happens to be based on the most popular books of all time ( i do not know anybody who havent red the books). All the battles have already been done th same way (See every movie categorized as peplum in the 50, 60s and 70s and you'll understand), the close shots of thes characters faces are nothing new and the narrative form is as simple as ""The Beauty and the Beast"" story. If you want to watch movies that are made by real artists and not by a lucky director of B-Series movies, check out Leos Karax, Jean-Luc Godard, Gus Van Sant, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Fritz Lang, Milos Forman, Francois Truffaut, Orson Welles, etc. Watch out, i do not say that everybody would like every one of these but i surely think that in the directors i've named, you'll find one that made a movie that'll make you cry, smile or feel fear better than a ordinary epic commercial movie as the Return of the King. In the end, i would also like to say that i liked the first two movies (as they amused me for three hours each) but i thought that the third one was a pale copy of the FOTR and TTT."
FilmSnobby,"Jan 4, 2004",3/10,"Well, it's finally over:  Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with  *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance.  How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears?  how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles?  how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf?  how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield?  how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors  (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)?  how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense??  (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win?  that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the  ""Extended Edition"", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone.  (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.)  Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for  ""special editions""  of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater:  what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see.  ""Extended-edition DVD's""  don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb.  I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, ""But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!""  But that's precisely my point.  *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book:  it's too long; it's too unwieldy.  As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*:  the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues.  Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix*  or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the  ""action-adventure""  genre.  But to say so is not to say much.  The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly.  It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake.  In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by:  but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire.  It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels.  Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin:  what, was  *Ulysses* chopped liver?  What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's  *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it.  I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor.  Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line.  While others may say, ""Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,""  I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into:  in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower.  Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp,  but it's still a pretty lame villain.  Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material.  In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity.  Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain.  But don't fret:  Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition.  In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone."
Tyson14,"Jan 18, 2015",10/10,"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something."
Keemer44,"Feb 19, 2020",10/10,"It is difficult to argue that many films should sit on top of the mountain of the greatest movies ever made, but one of those is The Return of the King. Technical, writing, and production aspects are all the best you can have in a film.The most impressive thing about ROTK is that it is the series ' third entry and that it is so good. Most trilogies that exist have the problem of the third being the weakest in the bunch. Not with this trilogy, though, this film is incredible on all levels.This film's drama and overall epicness is something I have simply not seen since its release. Not many films can so effortlessly blend fantasy and serious dramatic plot elements that sell the film's overall message.Not to forget the amazing display of acting that the whole cast put together. This is one aspect of the movie that does not appear to be getting enough credit. EVERYONE sells every scene and contributes to the film's immersion.The Return of the King holds the record, in a tie, for the most academy awards ever won and I cannot think of another film more deserving of this honor. The world-building displayed by Peter Jackson, coupled with the cast and crew, has not been matched outside of this series."
HiMyNameIsAlisha,"Apr 1, 2007",10/10,"It's REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. It's my number one favourite movie of all time. ( Well actually, the entire TRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time. ) There's no swearing or nudity. I still don't recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes, though. But anybody over eleven shouldn't be bothered. I don't recommend it for arachnophobia, because it might give them a heart attack. Anyways, this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. And everything in the middle is great, too. BY ALL MEANS RENT IT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first."
sinefili,"Mar 11, 2025",10/10,"I first watched The Lord of the Rings series in the cinema as a child, too young to grasp that I was witnessing one of the greatest epics in film history. Back then, it was just a grand adventure with battles, magic, and strange creatures, but over the years, its depth, artistry, and emotional weight became clearer. I still remember a kid crying and leaving the theater, overwhelmed by its intensity-something I now understand more than ever.Peter Jackson's adaptation is nothing short of a masterpiece, capturing the soul of Tolkien's world with breathtaking visuals, an unforgettable score, and a cast that embodied their characters to perfection. It's not just about good versus evil; it's about friendship, sacrifice, hope, and the resilience of the human spirit. Few films achieve such a perfect balance of spectacle and emotion.For me, The Lord of the Rings is more than just a movie series-it's an experience, a timeless journey that shaped my love for cinema. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for bringing Middle-earth to life in a way that still resonates, no matter how many times I return to it."
nickmesafilms,"Jan 4, 2012",10/10,"Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, ""The Lord of the Rings"" series finally comes to a close, with ""The Return of the King"". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where ""The Two Towers"" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003. ""LOTR: The Return of the King"", in my review, ""an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece""."
Danimal-7,"Apr 8, 2004",N/A,"Fellowship of the Ring was far and away the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies, and the Academy snubbed it.  The Two Towers was far less impressive, but that was understandable since the book of the Two Towers is the weakest of the original trilogy, and Jackson saved one of its best episodes, the confrontation between the hobbits and Shelob, for the third film.  The third film rebounds, as it ought to have given that the third book is the best, but it does not reach the level reached by the first movie, much less by the book.  Overall, Jackson did a good job, none of the movies is bad, and he deserves recognition for his work and the risks he took.  It's just hard not to feel disappointed, given the huge promise of the first movie, to find that the trilogy as a whole is quite good but nowhere near great.Certainly Jackson achieved a very impressive feat in constructing battle scenes that are even more exciting and terrifying than the excellent ones in the previous two movies.  The assault of Grond on the gate of Minas Tirith, the wild charge of the Rohirrim, the confrontation between Eowyn and the Lord of the Nazgul, and the desperate clash with the Oliphaunts are probably the finest fantasy warfare sequences ever filmed, managing to be intimate and detailed while also giving a sense of the overall strategic picture of the battle.  Kurosawa would have been hard put to do better.Too, Jackson pulled a major coup by constructing a version of the climactic scene at Mount Doom that will surprise the readers of the original book without disappointing them  and it would have been very easy to go wrong at this point.  And, Jackson manages a few times to do what he did with astonishing regularity in The Fellowship of the Ring: spot the dramatic moments and give them even more impact on film than they have on the printed page.  His version of the scenes in the Paths of the Dead and the lighting of the beacons of Gondor are masterful.But, Jackson has lost his eye for character; indeed, he has lost it so disastrously that I have to wonder whether his master portraits of Boromir and Gandalf in the first film were anything more than luck.  This is clearest in his revolting representation of Denethor.  Jackson's Denethor is a cretin: weak, craven, stupid, self-pitying, insensitive, spiteful, utterly devoid of redeeming features.  No man cut from this cloth could have lasted a month as Steward of Gondor, much less raised two of the boldest warriors of Minas Tirith or pitted his will against the Dark Lord Sauron for control of a Palantir.  The true story of Denethor, which Jackson misunderstood completely, is not of the crumbling of a coward, but what is infinitely more tragic, the crumbling of a brave man.Meanwhile, Gandalf has receded into Old Testament prophet mode, and seems to have no emotions of his own whatsoever.  Granted, even in the books Gandalf seems more distant and unapproachable after his reappearance, but he still had the old irritability and humor underneath.  Arwen, after being used so well in the first movie, again becomes an annoying hindrance to the plot. Gimli, at least, has improved somewhat since The Two Towers; he is still being used as comic relief, but the humor is now more of a deliberately self-deprecating kind than the humiliating pratfall jokes he had to suffer through last time.Also, I have to complain about some of the things that Jackson left out.  I will concede that he was right to omit two of my favorite parts: the meeting with Ghan-buri-Ghan and the Scouring of the Shire; time was limited, and something had to be cut.  (he could have omitted the Paths of the Dead too, if he'd had to, although that would have been a shame considering how well he did that sequence).  But the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar at the ruins of the Gate could have been done in thirty seconds, and the parley with the Mouth of Sauron would have required less than one minute to deliver one of the dramatic high points of the whole book.That Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and the Grey Havens are magnificently done almost goes without saying.  Art direction has been the one consistent strong point throughout this whole trilogy.In all, The Return of the King is a good movie.  Certainly far worse ones have won Oscars.  I just hope that the award doesn't lead to people imagining that this is the best movie of the trilogy.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation:  Go see it on a big screen.  But watch The Fellowship of the Ring first."
ringram,"Jan 7, 2004",6/10,"One has to admire this film (and the others in the trilogy) for its technical achievement and the scale of the undertaking, but that doesn't mean it is due any special respect beyond that. Of course opinions will vary wildly (and probably mostly contrary to mine), but for me this was just not sufficiently entertaining to justify its length. Well, the story is familiar, and that probably undermines the film for me (and I am not in awe of Tolkein's work anyhow), but just because Tolkein went over the top there was no need for Peter Jackson to follow. I would have probably liked the film better if it were not so long and repetitive (how many battle scenes can one watch before tiring of them). Sometimes more is less!"
sol-,"Jan 8, 2004",4/10,"The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales."
leonsott,"Oct 14, 2022",10/10,One of the best movies I have ever seen!! I recently revisited the Lord of the rings movies and this was the best of the three. The movie looks spectacular and the atmosphere is awesome. Peter Jackson did a brilliant job with these movies and this one is no different. Even to this day people remember this film and it truly is one of cinema's greatest movies of all time. It will go down as one of movies greatest trilogy and it will always stay close to mine and millions of peoples hearts.The acting is superb and the battles and action sequences are beyond comparison. The last battle and final minutes of the film are also really moving.BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dantheman0056,"Jul 25, 2008",10/10,"The Return of the King is the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings saga. Peter Jackson's portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. ROTK is an epic tale of sacrifice, courage, and friendship. Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. Elijah Woods once again portrays Frodo wonderfully as well as Sean Astin. The rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes, especially Viggo Mortenson and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. This has been a long journey of film starting with the Fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully."
zlx_zjlq,"Mar 24, 2020",10/10,A Blu-ray extended version for almost four and a half hours. The scene of the war is still magnificent. It is Frodo's luck to have a good friend like Sam. Gandalf is still otherworldly and holy. The last part of the play makes my eyes wept. This is the end of the epic blockbuster and an era. But classics will become eternal.
acedj,"Nov 1, 2019",10/10,"Before I talk about this movie, I want to say that I got my aged grandmother hooked on the series. I would visit her every Saturday, and I brought the first two movies over on DVD and we watched them. She was hooked. Peter Jackson did such a good job bringing the books to life. Surely there was a lot left out, he would have needed six movies to fit in everything from these novels. I am happy to say that I brought my grandmother to the theater to see this when it came out, and for the entire run, she did not move an inch. To me that says all there can be said about this movie. To see a woman well in her 80, so transfixed was such a treat. This movie is sad and happy all at the same time and is wonderfully done."

mithilbhoras-103-581296,"Oct 23, 2011",10/10,"Even after the second installment's grand success, I was still afraid that it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved wrong!This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it.You really get that feeling of ""The Return"". Unlike the first two, this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold, the score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important.For me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it (Only if you have seen the first two movies)10/10"

I sat next to my PC, brought a whole bottle of white wine for some reason and watched the whole trilogy until the morning. Needless to say I also got drunk for the first time. Best experience ever :D."
darimoviesthoughtsoffilms,"Dec 27, 2019",N/A,"I will keep it short, because what needs to be said has already been. This review is also spoiler-free.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is my personal favourite in the trilogy. It has the msot fight scenes out of any Lord of the Rings tale, and they are all very well written. The first big war that takes place is one of the best scenes in the saga and the ending of the movie is great. I could not fault the previous two, and it's the same for this one.Of course it is a 10/10. This movie is great, and something else I did not say previously was that I really liked everything they did with Gollum in this film. Buy it, no questions."
jerrywilson,"Dec 29, 2003",7/10,"First, let me say that I did like ""Return of the King."" It's a special effects masterpiece that is destined to become a classic, along with the first two installments in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga.But, to me, it was far less enjoyable than the first two films, the second of which was the best of the three.""King"" was far too long for what it had to say. And the ending (or should I say endings) really disappointed me. I kept waiting for the film to end, but it just kept going on and on. There were at least four times that I thought the film was over, but then the next scene would fade in. It would have been a much better ending if the film had finished with the resolution of the final battle, and then showed the denouement as a montage next to the closing credits. It would have removed about 20 minutes from the overly-lengthy film and would have made the ending less of a ""cut-and-paste"" style.So I'll give it a solid 7. But to me, it has been seriously over-rated by both fans and critics. I'm surprised that more of the critics, at least, haven't picked up on the weak ending."
NickFalk,"Jan 30, 2005",5/10,"Return of the King - Special Extended Edition.While normally a person to find enjoyment in both fantasy and science-fiction, I am one of the few who haven't really enjoyed Jackson's earlier takes on the Tolkien masterpiece I had less than stellar expectations.The film however did kick off on a promising note and for the first hour or so I was having a pretty decent time. After a while though my mind started to wander and after another hour I couldn't really care less about what happened to the characters.What is it that makes me so indifferent to these characters? I believe the whole thing boils down to Jackson's storytelling. At his best when he can wield his mighty camera over vast landscapes, showing off weird and wonderful creatures and humongous armies. He seems a lot less comfortable when dealing with human (hobbit, dwarfish, elfish) interaction on a smaller level. Unfortunately this somewhat spills over too the battle-scenes as well, and any enjoyment is purely on the visual side. Yes, the spectacle is certainly great - but it is still JUST spectacle.Another problem is that the actors are for the most part delivering speeches rather than having conversations. It makes the whole thing stale and the characters less life-like.On a positive note Jackson and his editors have improved the flow between the different story lines since the last film. The effects are mostly top-notch as is the production-design.Unfortunately it is let down by a director who seems to be bellowing, ""look what I can do"" to at all times. This ""more is more""-style served him well in his earlier work but it's just a bit too shallow to do a justice to a story of this scale.All in all not horrible, but certainly not the film to end all films...5/10"
numenorsniper-66396,"Oct 24, 2020",10/10,"I'm writing this review as I watch Fellowship again right now. I was 12 when Fellowship first released in the cinema, and LOTR defined my life ever since for many years, and the trilogy has remained my favourite movies, with no others that come close. They made me cry in the cinema, and in every viewing since. I can put on even a brief portion of the films, and the feelings come rushing back. Everything about these three movies is perfect, in my opinion, especially the amazing music that is so perfectly crafted that I can't think of a better movie soundtrack. The only OST that matches it is the Halo game soundtrack. Both the Halo and LOTR franchise began in the same year (2001), and were the two major pillars of my life since childhood.It's crazy to think that this trilogy began almost 20 years ago. I wonder if anything will ever touch LOTR. I suspect it will remain the all-time pinnacle of cinema, at least for the sheer love of them it has inspired in its vast fanbase.I think that the extended editions are indispensable and feel much more complete than the original cinematic releases. They are definitely worth watching in one sitting, back-to-back, which will take from wake til sleep, with breaks in between for second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, supper.Although I think Return of the King is the greatest possible ending to the greatest trilogy ever made, I still feel Fellowship of the Ring, where it all began, is the most rewatchable and comfy of the three. It has an air of enticing, dark and foreboding mystery that always captivates me. And that ending... what a cliff-hanger. I still remember the excitement it first created in me for the story's continuation, and the year-long wait for The Two Towers to release in the cinema. I would pay good money to see them all in a large and full theatre again.And the video games... I played most of them I think. I still play Battle for Middle Earth, i.e. the Edain mod.I can't imagine what my life would have been like if the LOTR films had never been created as they were, as they have been that important to me for well over half of my time alive at this point. They played a part in inspiring me to travel, to pursue filmmaking, and most importantly to get me interested in Tolkien's works.I am so thankful to everyone who were a part of creating them, as they are easily the greatest treasure of cinema."
runescapepass,"Nov 23, 2006",10/10,"as you see in the title, you can see it was a great film. i have only had the DVD for 2 weeks and i got a 2 disc DVD for £2.99. wow you might think.well back to the film, and this is a film whose without its amazing and stunning fights/wars, would be a OK film but wouldn't be a classic. when the battles begin, you can't stop watching- even if your mum asks you to tidy up. the scenes with the horses and their warriors galloping is breath taking and makes you want to re enact it as i'm a 13 year old boy, this was a film which you want to re enact and talk about.it fills you with thrill which is a very special thing to do. when people saw this, people were like, ""wow what an amazing film!"" and ""it's so good, i want to see it again and again!""i think this film was done by the right people and acted by the right people you couldn't image anyone for the roles. Such as aragon's character, Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film, i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role, i regard him as a brilliant actor.another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him, this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken (sorry for the spelling mistake), his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras, his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well, that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten, i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!"
zetes,"Dec 20, 2003",9/10,"An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat for the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were."

Steffi_P,"Apr 26, 2012",9/10,"Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time – such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin – are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says ""So passes Denethor"" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before."

Here are some miscellaneous thoughts from the perspective of a Middle Earth neophyte:If you're wondering if you can understand this movie without having seen the first two, you can. I didn't realize I was watching the third installment until the end when I saw there couldn't possibly be any more story. I had a little trouble here and there, but the movie never really lost me.Roger Ebert complained that characterization in these movies is given short shrift. Maybe so, but I thought Mr. Frodo and Sam – and the love they had for each other – were very moving. For me, they were the heart of this movie. I was roused into anger when Gollum framed Sam and temporarily split the two men – are Hobbits men? – apart.Everyone says it, and everyone's right. Gollum is a great villain; it's a great performance by Andy Serkis and the CGI craftsmen who jointly created him. I loved to hate Gollum.Is that woman who chafes at not being able to fight alongside the men a character from Tolkien's books? She's such a tedious action movie cliché – or would be if the actress playing her weren't so convincing and charming. She even ends up a genuine threat to a character who cannot die by any man, because of a technicality: she's not a man. That reminded me of the dreary moment in ""Jurassic Park"" when Helen Hunt cracks on Jeff Goldblum for talking about Man as if the term somehow excluded women. (Genesis: ""And God created Man, male and female."")I was very impressed with the special effects. Yes, they were awesome in themselves. But it's also impressive that they existed to tell the story – a rare feat these days when the story usually exists to service the effects. Still, the effects – while never overwhelming the story – sometimes overwhelmed themselves. Ebert gave special praise to the giant spider, but by the time it arrived I was already so sated with CGI monsters that this one didn't seem inordinately frightening. (Incidentally, Ebert says the spider scenes marked the best movie battle between giant insect and man, but these scenes – good as they are – don't replace the much lower-tech ""Them!"")I'm not in love with Peter Jackson's directing style. His camera is always sweeping around the scenery, which is almost invariably SFX-laden, as if to say, ""Nothing up my sleeve!""Viggo Mortensen is supposed to be a major star of this series, but he makes little impression on someone watching just this entry. Elijah Wood – with his enormous eyes and beguiling presence – feels like the protagonist. Orlando Bloom also has little to do, but unlike Mortensen he makes a bad impression. When we see him in closeup the only thought that seems to be roaming his mind is: ""Aren't I pretty?""What is it about some of these great old men of the theater – men like Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris – and here, Ian McKellan? One of them can just stand on screen for five seconds and even if you've never seen him before, you think, ""Wow, what a great actor.""Someone made a terrific comment on the message board for this movie, and it deserves to be read:""When anything becomes a 'craze' it tends to annoy those of us who enjoyed the material quietly and non-fanatically before it was a fad. When I was a young teen I actually had kind of a love-hate thing with George Lucas because when 'Star Wars' became popular it was suddenly 'cool' to like science fiction, and those of us who had liked it all along were assumed to be part of that herd.""I first read 'The Lord of the Rings' in my freshman year of high school (25 years ago now) and I have liked it ever since. I was glad to see the movies done, enjoyed them well, and plan to watch them again throughout the years. And though I suppose the advertising hype was necessary so the producers' gamble could pay off, I am glad it's over. Now the fad-of-the-month club people can move on to something else, and let me enjoy something I like in peace.""She was deriding both the people who obsessively love and abuse the movie. If the craze really is over, this might be a good time for a newbie to visit these movies. I saw this one, and despite my minor complaints, I loved it."
kiwikwi,"Dec 17, 2003",6/10,"Not surprisingly, a lot of good plot had been removed from the story, and a lot of bad plot inserted. This is hardly news; the same happened to the two predecessors. Much was lost by skipping ""The Scouring of the Shire"". The computer graphics are well-done but rarely convincing, and Gollum's only task is to provide comic relief. Most of the audience seemed to find him quite funny. I was just bored.Tolkien's books told a great story basically about the weakness of men (and other races), and the importance of not fighting alone. The best example being the events on the edge of Mount Doom. Tolkien made a strong point in that nobody is perfect, neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil.The film completely ignores this and simplifies things to pure black and white. There's good, and there's evil, with nothing in-between , no shades of grey.And that I think is sad.All that being said, the film has a few but important qualities, and that's the great camera work, the excellent acting and the stunning scenery - CG-scenery too.The rest of the CG is not that interesting, except for Shelob the spider who really makes up for it. The sound of a whole cinema audience simultaneously gasping in horror as ... Well, I won't spoil for those who haven't read the books. But wow. So, in the end, despite all its flaws, I recommend seeing this film. But go see it now, on the big screen. It won't be worth your time on TV."
kale854,"Jan 17, 2007",3/10,"I have been an avid LOTR fan for almost ten years now. I love love love love the books, but I really hated this movie.What Jackson did (and I'm surprised Phillipa or Christopher didn't call him out on it) was cut all the really important ending bits for sake of having disgustingly overblown battle sequences that made me want to kill myself. An hour is too long to be in battle, in a movie, I'm sorry. The CGI was amazing, and the deaths were good and all, but it didn't really help the story along. All it did was sit there. And we aren't even going to get into how much I hate Orlando Bloom.The fact that the scenes in the houses of healing were cut just pisses me off. Faramire and Eowyn deserved more than a glance during Aragorn's OMG SPIFFY coronation. They were the the link between Gondor and Rohan. They were actually quite major characters, and they were totally glossed over for the sake of some Oliphants falling over. Butchery? Yes, yes it is.And the endings. The endings weren't long enough. I know what you're thinking, ""but... the ending dragged on and on with no sign of an end in sight until it actually ended"", but seriously folks, don't give me that BS unless you've read the books as many times as I have (if you have, then by all means, give me that BS many people have read them more times then I have, but those people would agree with me) when Peter Jackson decided to use his ""artistic"" license to completely forget about half of the stuff in the books, he cheated people out of some seriously amazing story telling. The scouring of the Shire is what the whole trilogy is supposed to be about. It's about how Frodo leaves hating how much the hobbits take for granted in life, and then coming back, and helping to save them from something they have never before had the displeasure of meeting, and that is slavery. And then when they won their freedom back, they loved their heroes, and they celebrated them, and they were happy again, and they (hopefully) wouldn't take so much for granted again in the future.Okay, I'm getting myself upset, and I'll shut up. But seriously, all this movie is for is watching people run around and stab things. Not interesting to me."
jacobmeyerjkm,"Jan 30, 2020",10/10,"What isn't great about this. This characters are developed wonderfully, the acting is brilliant, the epic effects blow me away, the score is perfect. This is my personal favorite of the three but mind you, it is an extremely hard choice"
zkonedog,"Mar 8, 2017",10/10,"In terms of the individual installments of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings epic trilogy, Return of the King may actually be my least favorite (if only by a hair). The character-building isn't needed, like in Fellowship, and the battles are no better than those in Two Towers. The film's length (even the 3.5 hour theatrical cut) borders on prohibitive. Yet, it remains a slam-dunk 10/10 effort. The reason? The emotional payoffs to all the threads set up in those previous two installments.For a very basic overview, Return of the King sees the two primary plots of the trilogy reach their apex:-Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), & Gollum/Smeagle (Andy Serkis) finally reach Mordor--but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at the journey's end.-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again are feisty dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) the marksman Elf, and hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.The overall hallmark of this concluding chapter is the way in which it pays off all the threads set up in the previous two. This one doesn't have to break new ground, and largely doesn't. It just needs to put an amen to perhaps the most incredible book-to-film adaptation of all-time, which it accomplishes with aplomb. What Jackson really understands is how much of a journey the audience has taken alongside the famous fantasy characters (especially true if experienced during the three-year theatrical run). The end of their journey is also the end of ""ours"", in other words.Specifically notable here is the last half hour or so of runtime, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some of the most emotionally rousing scenes of the whole trilogy. I have yet to behold these moments without a tear being shed.Overall, then, Return of the King is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful vision. It may not break much cinematic new ground, but it doesn't have too. It simply does its job: pay off all the previously-established action, adventure, drama, humor, and (most of all) heart."
iVemula,"Mar 11, 2022",10/10,"Best movie series in the form of trilogy ever personally for me.I watch this movie very frequently.Loved the way this story was told. Loved every single character in this movie, especially Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen and Arwen played by Liv Tyler."
Aaron1375,"Jan 11, 2004",10/10,"This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me.  This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.  All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch.  I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can."
hcoldwell,"Mar 26, 2022",10/10,These films are glorious and they finished off this marvellous trilogy with a bang. Unlimited action and emotional plot twist and character arcs. Cinematography is just unparalleled to other trilogies.I have to say the more I watch this trilogy the more I put it up there with the Star Wars Classics.Timeless.
williampsamuel,"Dec 24, 2014",10/10,"In 2003, Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony, and set a new record for box-office receipts, one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale, surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version, it's even better than before.The reason why Return of the King, is so great is threefold. First, it's based on one of the twentieth century's greatest works of literature. Secondly, director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material, leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly, this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director, to the extremely large cast, to the effects wizards at WETA, everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back, no expense spared, and no detail overlooked, and the result is pure awesomeness.One of Tolkien's greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct, interesting characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all, and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn (Vigo Mortenson) we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. He's also the embodiment of true courage, being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron, ""Here I am, come and get me.""In Frodo (Elijah Wood) the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things, but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee, who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty, sharing every hardship, remaining ever vigilant against Gollum's treachery and the ring's corruption, and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend, even after he had turned on him.Even the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. They're just a couple of goof-offs, the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done, both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to one's people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli, though largely relegated to sidekick duty, still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges.But the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally, and with a severe case of split personality, he hates his very existence, and he hates the Ring for what it's done to him, but he desires to possess it even more. He's like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. It's amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. He's murderous, he's repulsive, he's pitiful, and he's one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature.Of course this isn't all internal struggles and character development; it's an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind, but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is! The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare, of pounding clubs and maces, bodies impaled with spears and arrows, or crushed beneath catapult stones (Within the bounds of PG-13). Yet there's also is the precision, even beauty, of Aragorn's swordsmanship, and Legelos's skill with the bow, their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow.And then there's the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed, with dozens of siege engines, more than two-hundred thousand orcs, and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge, but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole, or even heretical, but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson.I'm also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest I've seen, and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons, orc masks, and suits of armor, all beautifully – or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealand's Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic.Now obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see, especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. There's more humor, exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest, and more character development, especially with Faramir and Denathor. And there's lots more action, including Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King, a longer fight scene with Gollum, and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee's death scene near the beginning.Bottom line, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is one of the grandest, most exciting, and most inspiring movies you'll ever witness. Try as I might, I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially in its new and improved state."
eaw1990osaka,"Jan 18, 2004",N/A,"This wonderful conclusion to Peter Jackson's adaptation of .J.R.R. Tolkien's most popular written work should definetly win a few awards to say the least. The first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, inspired me to read the trilogy.  As I was only twelve at the time, these were the first books I actually finished reading. I decided first off that no matter how much the film makers changed the story, as long as the general plot line and points that Tokien was trying to make were made in a fashion that Tolkien would have liked, I would accept these movies. These are three spectacular films, or rather, one large movie version, created by crazy Tolkien fans, of the tale of how evil came into being and how it was destroyed.For those of you who have not seen this movie, and are wondering whether or not to go and see it, by now you know clearly what I think.  This movie is the conclusion to the first two movies, or rather the conclusion to one long continuing story. If you haven't seen the first two, go and see them before you come and see this one: There's nothing worse then hearing the end of a great tale before you even get a chance to begin it. Once you start this trilogy, you will not want to be left behind. It is about how the Hobbits, Frodo(an aristocrat) and Sam (his loyal gardener and best companion), struggle on to a land called Mordor to destroy a ring that corrupts the minds of even the strongest warriors, and about how their friends try to guide and help them in their quest to save all life, even if it takes their own lives to destroy the ring. The movie is full of tales of how Middle Earth and its people are making their last and final attempts to fight the evil, and save not only their homes, wives and children, but their own humanity and souls as well. It is a tale of how life almost disappeared but when darkness almost completely covered all earth, some courageos people, whether from the sanity of their minds or rightness of their hearts gave their last shot to save life because they valued it.  They gave their last hope, said their last prayers, and were able to destroy this evil. Nothing that I can say would be good enough to put these people and their world into the right words so that you could imagine it: Just watch the movie so you can start experiencing it."
bob-26,"Dec 26, 2003",3/10,"There was so much love and hate from me and my friends for the first two movies: Nearly perfect visualization, but some really bad interpretation of the main characters. Watching The Return of the King was unbearable and I left the cinema when I saw Gandalf and Frodo giggling after the fall of the ring and making themselves ridiculous.I guess Return of the King totally missed the spirit of the book. All the highlights of the third book went wrong in the movie: The fight of Eowyn against the Lord of the Nazgul; Aragorns and his way of the death; the relationship between Gandalf and Denethor; when Gandalf saved Faramir of the Nazgul; the relationship between Pippin and Denethor; the meeting between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgul; Aragorn healing the people of Minas Tirith after the battle; ...But mostly I was disappointed about the behaviour and attitude of some of the main characters: I think that Gandalf, Legolas, Eowyn, Pippin, Merry and Denethor don't match with the characters in the book. And that is really a great disappointment for me.Sorry for my bad english..."
sanskar10100,"Mar 9, 2022",10/10,"To justify the title, I can count many merits of the movie. The background score is grand and powerful, the story is handled very well, and the CGI is balanced and beautiful. But, in the third act of the movie, there are 3 major scenes, each of which brought me to complete tears. One of them is the greatest single moment I've ever seen in movies, period. Throughout the movie, it's very evident that it was made by people who clearly adored the source and a great attention to detail can be found throughout.I've seen complaints that at some points the movie diverges from the source material too much or that it's longer and doesn't pack as much substance. I feel the first point can be validated by artistic liberties, while the second ultimately boils down to personal preferences. Speaking personally, the movie did not feel long. The screenplay justifies the runtime, and makes the movie cohesive. It's the grand finale to the greatest trilogy of all time, and completely cements its legacy for years to come.NOTE: This review is based off of the special extended editions, and not the theatrical cut."
claudio_carvalho,"May 29, 2004",10/10,"The conclusion of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made is in the same level of the other two parts of this splendid story. The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is again outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. The eleven Oscars, the IMDB User rating of 9,0 with 62,820 votes and the 2,219 reviews are sufficient. I just want to record my enthusiasm with such a film. Unfortunately the same did not happen with the sequence of Matrix, where the first film was excellent, but the sequences were very disappointing. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): `O Senhor dos Anéis: O Retorno do Rei' (`Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The')"
DerSongsurfer,"Dec 7, 2006",10/10,"I think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already, but still I will try. There are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon, not this one. In front of an amazingly beautiful scenery, Peter Jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie, which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clichés and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand.Although I am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten, The ""The Lord of the Rings""-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade."
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 21, 2005",10/10,"It all comes down to this. The humans and hobbits now have their final battles to fight with the forces of evil. I can't actually say anything about ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" that does it justice, except to say that it is a great movie in the true sense of the word. Everything that we've awaited in life is summed up in this piece of cinematic history. Every one of the cast members does a masterful job. Therefore, it makes sense that this movie was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture, and won EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. ""LOTR: TROTK"" is THE movie that you have to see to believe. It is everything that we like about movies."

This movie--this trilogy really--is in no need of my praise, so I'll say that there were just a couple of moments of exasperation for me (which I guess will happen over a three plus hour movie). Among the points of exasperation was a point when I wanted to slap Frodo. I'm sure that part needs no mention."

jrg-9,"Jan 16, 2004",N/A,"The Lord of the Rings novel is one of the best English novels of all time, certainly in the top five.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy by New Line Cinema will long have similar standings in the realm of movies.When I was younger, every once in awhile I would sit down on the couch and watch the Star Wars trilogy.  Six-and-one-half hours later I would be done and think, `Wow!' Now, after having attended the marathon showing of all three movies of LOTR, I didn't finish the night by thinking, `Wow!'  I finished it so overwhelmed I didn't know what to think.  It wasn't until the next morning that I could comprehend what I had just experienced the day before. history being made.Each of these movies is acclaimed for nearly every element of their being. People who were never fantasy fans found themselves in a new world.  Those of us who have long been fans still found ourselves in a new world.  I have read many of the comments others have made, and I would like to address one issue in particular.No movie will ever be exactly like the book it is based on (nor should it). That's why movies often begin with `Based on the novel.' or `Inspired by.' Screenwriters must take certain liberties in adapting a novel for the screen.  Very often parts must be rewritten or entirely left out.  Peter Jackson's LOTR is his vision of the novels.  And it is a glorious vision.I am a fan of the books and of the movies.  They are two different entities. The Return of the King is my second favorite.  I love the Fellowship most and the Two Towers least.  If I gave these movies grades they would be 98 for Fellowship, 97 for Return of the King, and 95 for Two Towers.  They aren't perfect, but my idea of perfection is not Peter Jackson's or anyone else's.There is something in this movie for almost everyone; love, friendship, huge conflicts, anger, despair, fear, and hope.  If you never see this movie while it is the theatre you are missing out on an experience of a lifetime. I have pledged to myself to see it at least once a week while it is in the theatres here.  If the first two movies were still out I would see them as well.  In all likelihood we will never have this chance again. take it while you can."
tributarystu,"Jan 9, 2004",7/10,"I have never loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I considered them nothing more than a fine fantasy story, with its smart and silly characteristics, too long and seriously overrated. The fact that these films were thoroughly enjoyed by loads of people I can comprehend easily: the movie's theme appeals to all and I can not deny that it is nicely all nicely put together. But it is still far too long as it lacks a certain...intelligence. Coming to the third installment, I sit and stare. Making fun of a movie is quite easy, what's hard is to understand it. I am not trying to say that this here film has left a mark upon me, but merely that some people are wrong and that I may be as well.SpoilersIt's got some strong points, it's got some weak points and overall it's just what I expected it to be. After a rather pathetic beginning, the movie gets off from where the previous one let us. War, freedom, good and evil, love, trust, friendship, maturity, justice and peace. That's what will concern you once you're in this joint. Some impressive scenes, with sparkles of humor and shallow morality will add up into a massive fight. It's never about the outcome, it's about the way you do it, so I will accept the more shameful moments regarding the story. I might say I would want to admire it all, but it's just too much of a contrast between dark and bright. That's all in this movie but not in our hearts or in our world. Are the characters really complex? Is anyone really worth remembering? They are all weak faced with the power of the ring and none impress in this regard. I try to think of a weakness for us all and I can't find it. This fantasy world is supposed to have one evil which really concerns us, with minor ""misunderstandings"" between people. It's a call for unity, because only through this can we be able to outlive a fight. I fear just that I can not relate to it. I see no war for a common goal. And the problem does not lie around us, it lies within us. We can't find a ring and make all problems disappear after a tremendous quest. That's what makes me feel that The Lord of the Rings is just a story. A long, sporadically remarkable story. But I live in an era of naturalism and realism and I can not accept such a piece of art, as it is, just for the sake of being. I simply can't feel this as a great movie, because so many fates are involved and everything is too perfect. Perfection is bitter sweet, not this film. For me, LoTR is just bitter. But at least not as bitter as the Matrix.Fans will remain fans, detractors will remain detractors. Things don't usually change in life and for that you need to make a great effort. Linear and coherent storytelling adds up in a never ending experience. For most, I am somewhat convinced to say, a superb one. In my heart I feel both joy and pain, because it all means something. The fact that people dream of such a fantasy world, means something. This is not my fantasy world though. This is not my world. 7.5/10"
cricketbat,"Feb 4, 2020",10/10,"The Return of the King is an impressive film because it wraps up the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a way that is satisfying for both fans of the books and those who have only seen the movies. This finale is a rollercoaster of emotions, with impressive sets, elaborate costumes, and eye-popping visual effects. The Lord of the Rings was already a great novel, but it has now become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made."

kevin_robbins,"Aug 7, 2022",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) Extended Edition is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows our heroes marching to their doom in hopes of saving Middle Earth. Sam and Frodo continue slithering through the mountains in hopes of destroying the ring with Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragon and friends prepare to stand off against Sauron's army in hopes of distracting them long enough for Frodo to slip by then and destroy the ring. Likelihood for success is low but hope is high...This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Viggo Mortensen (Hidalgo), Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) and Liv Tyler (Armageddon).There is nothing that isn't perfect about this movie except you never want it to end. The settings are so beautiful and well filmed. The cast is perfectly selected and demonstrate both their desperation and their will to push forward. The inner struggles within every character is perfectly depicted. The attire, props and use of CGI to create both magic and monsters was awesome. The battle scenes are epic and the ending is absolutely amazing and closes the trilogy perfectly.Overall this is the greatest fantasy series ever created that is an absolute must see. I would score this a strong 10/10 and consider it an absolute must see."
cagancelik,"Feb 12, 2022",10/10,"By the light of Amazon's recent massacre of the lore and franchise, I realized how great the original trilogy by Peter Jackson is. Jackson has respected the Tolkien and his writings and refused add any view from any side."
Tera-Jones,"Mar 4, 2016",10/10,"The 3rd and final film of the LotR series. This one looses nothing it only continues the story. Picks up right where ""Two Towers"" leaves off. Grittier story, more foe & dirtier grittier battles - the worst is yet to come... The Witch King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgul.This film has an air of horror to it... more frightening than the first two films. In the end, you whistle is wet for more.A wicked film well worth watching. High fantasy fans as well as those who love a lot of action and adventure will enjoy watching this one for the first time or again and again.10/10"
denis888,"Sep 7, 2007",10/10,"Well, in the LOTR book, the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears, and the death of Saruman was not like a deleted scene in the DVD version, and then there was not the feat of Legolas of killing an elephant so easily, and then Sam never held Frodo hanging on a cliff There are many points of bitter criticism of the film, and many are true. But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien, but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on."
johndragnic,"Mar 23, 2021",10/10,"Trying to describe this masterpiece is overwhelming. No word would do justice to what it really is! Perfectly narrated, interpreted and expressed.The best movie ever seen!!"
Angel-Shadow,"Sep 21, 2005",10/10,"Truly a masterpiece. This film was more than worthy of its 11 Oscars. The fellowship was stunning, the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. The thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion, and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. I myself have read the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. Peter Jackson, I feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray Tolkien's vision.Without a doubt the speech, roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. People say the ending is too long, I say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont, and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten."
Patuquitos,"Feb 5, 2005",7/10,"My summary may be pedestrian, but it's the naked truth. This is the movie you make when you are given millions of dollars and almost two years. It's spectacular, but lacks charm. It's a must see if you are into popcorn cinema, but it shares the same aesthetic of the previous two movies, and it gets tiresome. As an adaptation, it's not perfect, but it's as good as it gets if you take into account how difficult is to make such a big movie.This the latest modern mammoth movie, so take it for what it is. It hasn't been the first, and it won't be the last. Sometimes your jaw will drop, but everybody knows that there is not much merit in making the film looks the way it does. The merit lies in having finished the movie at all.It's almost impossible to write a more complex review and not sound like an pretentious asshole. I had a lot of fun, but something was lacking. Apply this review to parts I & II.RATING: 7.1"
melissa_ramos,"Jan 18, 2004",10/10,"I knew it would be good, but this takes the entire cake.  Peter Jackson has absolutely outdone himself with this masterpiece.  True, there are a few tiny holes in the plot, but they are easily overlooked.  Even if you're not a huge fan of Tolkien, you should really make an attempt to see this movie.  I wasn't a fan of the books, but Jackson's movies have inspired me to pick them up and give them all a good read.  Can't wait for the DVD. Let's see if Jackson does as good a job with The Hobbit."
agmoldham,"Dec 18, 2003",8/10,"The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life.I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The ""That still only counts as one"" line to Legolas was very funny though.Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years."
Quinoa1984,"Dec 18, 2003",10/10,"In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end.  The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole.  Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up.  In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it.  It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place.  Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)"
Aposplace,"May 27, 2005",10/10,I can't stop thinking how Lotr:TTT and Lotr:Rotk would be if were not filmed together with the first film.Maybe Peter Jackson would thought that he should change some elements of the two last films in order to improve them resulting in many complains by the audience because The Two Towers and The Return Of The King lack the atmosphere of the first one.On the other hand maybe he could actually make them even better(History made me doubt this perspective).No one really knows .what we already know is that Jackson had some excellent material into his hands and made some wise decisions about how he would use them.Way to go Mr Jackson!Now give us Silmarilion on screen too...
masterf,"Jun 30, 2005",10/10,"Lord of the Rings-The Return of the King is surely the greatest movie ever made.I consider that is has the most fascinating plot ever written.The universe of the movie is unique: a fantastic world which includes almost every mythical creature we heard of. Elves,orcs,trolls,hobbits,all these make up a charming atmosphere.The idea of a Ring that can submit the will of it's bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.Also, the love story between Aragorn and the immortal Arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. The fate of king Debethor reminds us of Greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learnings,most in the words of the wizard Gandalf.The fantasy and the charming, sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind."
FilmCreature,"Jul 7, 2007",10/10,"The Return of the King is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one is the best.Aragorn takes the lead role this time, as he faces his destiny to become the king of Gondor. Gollum (motion-captured Andy Serkis) is becoming a big problem for Sam (Sean Astin), as Frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than Sam himself.And Pippin (Billy Boyd) pledges his allegiance to Denethor (John Noble), the crabby and evil stand-in leader of Gondor. Denethor doesn't have the best attitude in the world, such as when he tries to burn his own son alive.The ending is very long, but it isn't bad. The entire movie is riveting, magical cinema, and I ate up every minute of it. The Return of the King is a masterpiece, and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt (more than that, actually).4/4"
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jan 31, 2020",8/10,"The 2003 conclusion to the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a tour de force. This is by all accounts the best movie in the entire trilogy.Why? Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".There is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.Needless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.The performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.For me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.My rating for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a solid eight out of ten stars."
rooee,"Apr 12, 2010",6/10,"Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get."
raduking,"Jan 11, 2004",5/10,"The third movie brings nothing more than the second... It has more goofs than the second i won't enumerate them here. The end is so boring that when I went to the cinema to see it, all people stood up about 3 times in the last 20 minutes to go home... It also misses one important chapter when Saruman destroys the Shire... Some characters have no meaning in the movie (Faramir, Witch King)... Witch King has very big orientation problems trying to hit Eowyn with that big weapon rather than use some witchcraft to kill her... Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) doesn't have the voice of a King when he tries to encourage the army to fight (see Braveheart (Mel Gibson) or Gladiator (Russel Crowe))...It would have probably been a great movie without the first 2 parts, but this one brings nothing new or extraordinary except the Undead army which kills all orcs BAAH !If you are interested in special effects then go watch the movie, if you are interested in how the story ends better read the book.6 points out of 10."
fallenadvocate311,"Jul 4, 2007",10/10,"As a movie virtuoso, I have seen nearly over hundreds of movies dating back as far as the mid 70's. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a movie out there that is worthy of anyone's 95 minutes of their day. With all the nonsense, exaggerated, repetitive, and culturally degrading pieces of work out in the movies today, I can come to agree with that. However, as many titles that may leave your eyes bleeding, there are some that leave not only your eyes, but your ears begging for more.In Summer 2003, I was already impressed by the opening trailers to the icing of the ingenuity cake. I had no idea how much better the presentation really was until I walked into the theaters that Winter, only to be overwhelmed by the beautiful opening music as the title was being presented. 'The Return Of The King', focuses on many life ordeals at the same time keeping it's creative fantasy structure into perspective. Troubles such as betrayal, deception, disloyalty, greed, and malice are all shown in this work, showing how our lives can relate to a world so very different than reality.Not only did the flowing dialogue allow viewers to validate the setting similar to the medieval ages, but that the soundtrack used in this masterpiece was not only original, but absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The instrumentals along with the vocals throughout numerous scenes in the film, made it so much worth watching. It had almost been as if someone had made a visualization of an epic poem and combined it with an exciting and interest-grabbing plot.My recommendation to this film is pretty strong. This film has definitely earned it's 11 academy awards as well as it's box office high. I can clearly say this film, inspired by Tolkien's brilliant novels, is one of the most exquisite and most beautiful pieces of literature turned into a pure illustrated masterpiece.Bravo, Peter Jackson, bravo."
larosaj-26666,"Nov 4, 2019",10/10,"I don't have to add anything to that. The battles, drama, acting, score, sets, characters and effects are at the apex of moviemaking. The 4 hour extended cut is a must see with many memorable added moments. Spectacular and jaw dropping. Jackson achieved something we may never again see in our lifetimes."
obertjeremiah,"Feb 4, 2025",10/10,"Still the greatest movie ever madeNothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!"
BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Jun 5, 2004",10/10,"WHAT A MOVIE!!! THE SETS!!! THE MUSIC!!! THE VISUALS!!! THE ACTION!!!An amazing achievement in every sense of the word. The lack of action and slow pace of the The Two Towers is made up for here. The fight with Shelob, the rescue from Cirith Ungol, the Siege of Minas Tirith, the crossing of the plains of Mordor, and the destruction of the RING. ALL HERE!!! All amazing!There can be said nothing negative of this film. I was absolutely blown away in the theater. The Siege was done so well and is one of the best action scenes ever. Also, the end was amazing. The book dragged on a bit with the Shire and Saruman, but none of that is here. The destruction of the Ring destroys all evil, like it should! And the sequence when the Army of Gondor is at the Black Gate and Frodo, with Sam and Smeagol, are in Mount Doom is absolutely jaw dropping. The music, Aragorn's speech (almost like Henry V), and the action are a terrific culmination and serve as a truly breath-taking climax.However the film amazingly well done overall and easily the best out of the trilogy. The crew behind this film worked their butts of as there is no sign of sloppiness. It is all very well done, from beginning to end and it provides an awesome end to a great trilogy. 10/10"

Andr678,"Feb 13, 2025",N/A,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a film - it's an epic conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. The movie delivers breathtaking visuals, emotional storytelling, and unforgettable battles, making it a monumental achievement in fantasy filmmaking.The narrative beautifully weaves together multiple storylines, balancing intense war sequences with deeply personal moments of courage, sacrifice, and redemption.The visuals are nothing short of stunning. From the sweeping landscapes of Middle-earth to the hauntingly dark plains of Mordor, every frame feels meticulously crafted. The Battle of Pelennor Fields is a cinematic triumph, with thousands of warriors, towering oliphaunts, and the terrifying Nazgûl creating one of the most thrilling battle sequences ever filmed.The cast delivers outstanding performances. Viggo Mortensen's transformation from a wandering ranger to the noble King of Gondor is powerful and inspiring. Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee provides the emotional heart of the film, with his devotion to Frodo leading to some of the trilogy's most tear-jerking moments. Andy Serkis' motion-capture performance as Gollum remains one of the best, capturing the character's internal conflict with eerie precision.Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score elevates every scene, from the triumphant ""Ride of the Rohirrim"" to the hauntingly beautiful ""Into the West."" The music perfectly complements the film's emotional highs and lows, making it an unforgettable part of the experience.The Return of the King is a rare film that exceeds expectations, delivering an emotionally satisfying and visually spectacular conclusion to the trilogy. With its sweeping battles, deep emotional core, and masterful storytelling, it is a testament to the power of cinema. It rightfully won 11 Academy Awards and its place as one of the greatest films of all time."
MovieAddict2016,"Jan 4, 2004",6/10,"Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" All eight of them found it ""good"" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (""I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!"" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the ""best film of all time,"" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than ""The Godfather"" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from ""Rings"" fans claiming that ""The Godfather"" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" those who claim they are superior to ""The Godfather,"" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? ""Citizen Kane""? ""Casablanca""? ""Taxi Driver""? ""Sweet Smell of Success""? ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? ""Chinatown""? ""Apocalypse Now""? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of ""Star Wars"" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought ""The Two Towers"" was dark, but ""The Return of the King"" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, ""The Ring is mine,"" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. ""Wasn't that good?"" I heard someone say. ""No,"" was the reply. ""The Return of the King"" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, ""Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway."" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype.I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer"
betsywetsy,"Mar 6, 2004",5/10,"I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three.  I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning.  I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful.  Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness.  Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief.  The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (""A diversion!"") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question.  Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background.  It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive.  Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake.  Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from.  Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes.  Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops.  Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right?  They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long.  The songs were good.  The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent.  Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies.  The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace.  ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT.  And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good.  *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy.  Gak!  Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this."
ffiisshh,"Sep 14, 2019",10/10,"As an avid Star Wars fan since the age of ten, I never thought anything could supplant the classic trilogy...but I was wrong. The Lord of the Rings with Return of the King as the grand finale, is truly the greatest film of all time. Watching this beloved classic has become a heartwarming and thrilling classic that never gets old, viewed year after year. I am emotionally and spiritually drained and uplifted every time. JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson have brought to life the most inspiring and enjoyable tale of all time. I have never before or since enjoyed a set of films as I have these. Beautiful and breath-taking beyond words, Lord of the Rings is the Masterpiece for the ages!"
jszweep,"Mar 8, 2022",10/10,"I still get goosebumps every time I watch this movie. I still at awe with how engaging the story is on screen, how good the visuals have held up even after all this time, and still get emotional with everything going on. It's a wonderful conclusion to an amazing trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and I wish for this movie to be cherished for years to come!"
henrycoles9,"Jan 31, 2021",10/10,"The other night I had watched the first movie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and then woke up to find out it was exactly the 20th anniversary of its release!The best thing was that, unlike most other movie franchises, it got better with every sequel. Though it might get a bit hokey at times, the hearty friendship between Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee was superb and heartwarming. You just don't see grown friends crying in each other's arms anymore! The sharp distinction of good and evil, which doesn't exist in today's movies anymore, was writ large. I also liked the portrayal of the evil Lord Sauron and his hideous Orcs cutting down forests and making weapons in their macabre caverns as a metaphor for the industrial destruction of our modern world.But good wins! And this was a magnificent and fitting end to one of the most epic movie franchises ever."
zlatko168,"Jan 16, 2021",10/10,"This is beyond doubt the greatest movie in film history. Everything is perfect - the story, the script, the directing, the music. I only wish they made six instead of three movies."
mreatenfish,"Mar 20, 2021",10/10,"This is an amazing piece of the directing craft!

atarimania1976,"Dec 13, 2003",10/10,"On december 12, just like the previous 2 years, I was invited to attend the dutch premiere of Lord of the Rings. What an event it was...From the stunning opening scene (simple yet effective) Peter Jackson plays out all his cards in this final chapter. The epic wars are bigger, meaner, and longer (Helms Deep will now look like a fun afternoon in at playground), and then there's ""that"" climax. Jackson always said that the 3rd part was his favorite and everyone will agree. He puts the most difficult scenes together with nothing but flair & skill, sometimes he goes a bit ""over the top"" which adds some humour and a modern touch. At the actor front, one is in top-form: Bernard Hill. This great actor plays the part of his life. A supporting actor Oscar should be his reward. As said before in other reviews, the music is first rate, as are all the other things: cinematography, art-direction, costumes, editing, CGI-FX.....etcetera.My verdict is clear: for 20 years, since I saw Return of the Jedi aged 7, movies are my life. I've been known to be very critic, so when I say that this movie is the best I've ever seen; I'm not exaggerating. The other 2 parts have been at the top of my all time favorites (along with the StarWars saga), but this one tops them all.I'm glad that as a fan of the book since 1991, I've been able to experience this. A movie to cherish, for the rest of your life."
sandihina,"Dec 18, 2023",N/A,"I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the."
o_willemse,"Jan 5, 2004",7/10,"I loved it! No doubt about it, spectaculair effects, battles etc. But, and there's a big but, the movie doesn't add anything new to the trilogy. In the first part we could marvel at the wonderfull world of Tolkien that Peter Jackson so brilliantly captured on the big screen. In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects.But what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book....."
montymarmotte,"Jun 19, 2004",5/10,"In short, a very, very good film which would have been the trilogy's best and have gained a 10, had not it not gone on so long. I get the feeling Peter Jackson didn't want to end the series, and so made the final film last as long as humanly possible. In the end it just gets tiring.I really will not be watching the extended version, which may well stretch to five hours. Why couldn't they just do a Kill Bill on it?Oh well, I don't want to try to put you off, at 7/10 it is still well worth a watch, just don't try to watch the whole trilogy at once. Not without a family-sized KFC bucket, at least."
svivschenk,"Jul 17, 2019",10/10,"A lot of people hate the film because it's not like the book. If they did it would be incredibly long, which the series already is!While LOTR is not an easy series to adapt, this version did it really good, with engaging characters, a good story, and legendary visuals.Hate all you want. If you find the book better than this, go right ahead, but this is in my opinion, the perfect trilogy."
Vartiainen,"Sep 15, 2015",9/10,"The end of Middle-Earth draws near as the armies of orcs march against Minas Tirith, the great city of Gondor and the last bastion of Men, while at the same time Frodo and Sam have reached the borders of Mordor with their guide Gollum. Darkness spreads and all hope seems to wane, for even if the diminishing strength of Men were to prevail against crushing odds, their fate rests on the shoulders of a hobbit, the smallest of beings.The Return of the King is an epic conclusion to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the individual plot lines come crashing together as we witness the last great battle between the forces of good and evil. This is grand fantasy at its finest. Every time you're allowed to draw breath and every time you hold your breath in fear and terror, there's something new and even more majestic waiting to reveal itself. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith is probably the finest individual battle scene I've ever seen put on film. An opinion shared by many. And the thing is, it has aged remarkably well. Here and there you can spot the use of CGI, but not often. I've seen big budget movies this year, full twelve years later, which look noticeably worse than this film in that regard.I also really like how the scale shows not just in battle scenes but in every other aspect as well. The dialogues are full of emotions, great speeches, deep feelings, talks about fate, the elusiveness of hope, the strength of belief. Sure, it's escapism, but at its finest. This movie is the prime example of why we still tell stories to ourselves.And yeah, I'm the first to admit that this is the most flawed film in the trilogy. They have turned Gimli into a complete joke character at this point. There are perhaps one or two endings too many. The ghost army subplot comes a bit out of nowhere. The emotions do boil over a touch too much. But in the end, I still love this film and this world. It is an archetype, an ideal against which all alike stories are measured.The Return of the King is my least favourite film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's still easily one of my favourite movies, one of the finest epic movies ever made and more than worthy of all its praise."
andrewklocek,"Aug 14, 2013",10/10,"Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. It is almost perfect, if not perfect. Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen, but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time, the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasn't a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time.Im not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. Will they get there? If they do will they lose anybody else? What happens? Trust me watch this movie, along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest."
zelleduhh,"Jan 26, 2015",10/10,"I first watched the LOTR Trilogy when I was 13 y/o. It was my father's favorite movie. Back then, I was not able to understood fully what it is all about but I liked it. I did not love it like I loved Harry Potter back then, but I liked it.Entering High School, I have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again, and this time I absolutely loved it. I became obsessed with the story. Tolkien, created a beautiful world, and wrote about this amazing characters. We see each of the characters' growth as we followed their journey up to the end.The cinematography of all movies are spot on. The sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time.The Return of The King concludes the story of Middle-Earth, having peace back in their world. We know that CGI can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film, it was done just right.This truly elevated my standard with films. The quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece."

TheWolf1986,"Dec 21, 2020",N/A,"This trilogy does not need to be presented, it is a masterpiece, a timeless classic, as far as I'm concerned the best film in the history of cinema"
rvs_dmr,"Sep 23, 2004",7/10,"First of all: I liked this movie, and i could watch it an awful lot of times. But that is mostly due to the great special effects .The point i rated this movie a 7 is because of the stupid story mistakes Peter putted in his movie. Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield?These are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written."
surfchick2,"Dec 29, 2004",5/10,"This film was compelling - it kept you watching. The spectacular backgrounds and both strange and interesting characters are all attractions. But the storyline is basically rubbish. I haven't read the books myself, but can only imagine them to be terrible as the story by itself is poor, and only works with the images to support it. This story is fantasy that isn't quite convincing. I didn't feel that you got to know the characters at all which made you feel distant from what was happening. I'm not a particular fan of this genre, but it can be effective if it convinces you that you are there and that it is real. I would watch this film, purely as something to fill a couple of hours. Long movies are always hard to keep at a good standard the whole way through and often drop down in your ratings, within the last half hour. This is why I give it a 5, because it really is in the middle. Nothing very bad, just nothing to shout about."
alindsayal,"Dec 12, 2021",10/10,"So I have now made my way through The Lord Of The Rings trilogy and that culminates with The Return Of The King, one of the biggest films ever made and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the forces of Gondor & Rohan fight to protect Middle Earth from the forces of Mordor while Frodo, Sam & Gollum get closer to Mount Doom and their endgame.Main Character
Elijah Wood is back as Frodo and I think he does a great job in selling just how tough the journey has been on Frodo compared to the other characters. The ring is just weighing him down and this film in particular he is really struggling with it and finding his mind on the brink. I mean Frodo isn't the most likeable character for parts of this film but I thought Wood did a great job in portraying the anxiety and torment that Frodo has gone through in this trilogy. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and talking about his character is pretty funny, I mean the title of the film spoils his whole character arc but he is still great here and does well in his role and just does a great job as a protagonist.Supporting Characters
Sean Astin does a really good job in the first two films but this is the film where he really stands out and for me gives the best performance in the film. There is a line in The Two Towers where Frodo says he wouldn't get far without Sam and you really see it in this film, as Frodo struggles Sam gets stronger and Astin does a fantastic job in this film as the moral centre. Sir Ian McKellen is given more to do here as Gandalf The White and he is great, he gets to see more of the action and nails every moment he is on screen and just adds so much to the film. Andy Serkis is also back as Gollum and the effects are even better here, Gollum looks fantastic and the character is fleshed out here and it even better, Serkis truly deserves credit for his role here and Gollum is also a real highlight of the film. The rest of the cast also do great jobs, Miranda Otto as Eowyn gets more to do here, Bernard Hill as Theoden gets more to do, Merry and Pippin have more to do and they are all fantastic and have really good character arcs, the whole cast really do a great job in the film.Story
The story is epic on all levels, more of the characters have interesting character arcs and more time to shine. The story is in three plots really, Frodo, Sam & Gollum, Gandalf & Pippin and the rest of the characters at Rohan, and all of it is really interesting. The film uses its extra runtime to flesh out more characters and makes the story be more epic and have more depth to it then the previous films. It ends the trilogy pretty much perfectly and does it really well with these characters that you will have grown to love over the 9 hours that you have watched.Script
The script is great, the dialogue and ways the characters are written takes these larger then life personalities and makes you care about them which is no mean feat. This film knows when to focus on the drama and it knows when to have a laugh, it balances the plot arcs very well and makes the film interesting from start to end.Style
This film is epic on scale, I mean it could be argued that in terms of scale this is the largest film ever, the battle scenes are huge in scale and raises the scale which was necessary for a final instalment of this epic franchise. The film has over 3 hours to tell its story and I think it does a good job of it and keeps the pacing high for pretty much the entire film which is a difficult thing to do.Overall
Overall, I mean this is The Return Of The King so of course it is amazing, this whole trilogy is one of the greatest of all time and if people haven't watched it then they just need to get on it, especially while we are in lockdown.Rating - 10/10."

ja_kitty_71,"Apr 6, 2008",10/10,"Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler.In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo and Sam (who are led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that was set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry and Pippin at the now-destroyed Isengard, thanks to Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory, but Aragorn was worried about Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, which had been found and confiscated. But then something happened: the palantir revealed The Eye of Sauron and his plans to attack Minas Tirith, so Gandalf took Pippin and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to return home. So she rode home and begged her father to resurrect Narsil's ancient blade and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he could become the king he was born to be.So overall, all three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son; I mean, it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the friendship that is developing between Merry and Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox."
canuck4uall,"Jan 16, 2004",7/10,"The third installment of the Lord of the Rings was a good movie, however, I had many problems with the character development and acting in the movie. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, (the only two exceptions,) played the roles of Frodo and Samwise admirably.  Even with some of the adaptations from Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, the story is still intriguing. However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased.  And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed.  All in all, it was a good movie.  Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody."
Elori,"Dec 18, 2004",5/10,"I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale."
ElMaruecan82,"Dec 4, 2016",10/10,"I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.""Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!""This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature.And through this ""Return of the King"", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed ""to have a story before the story"", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity.Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of ""The Return of the King"" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake.And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a ""The End"" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections.Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Titanic"" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever."
tsangaridesi,"Sep 6, 2014",10/10,"The movie was spectacular. The trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. It was unbelievably impressive. Starting with the movie, once again, the acting was phenomenal. The emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. It's amazing at how a movie can be four hours long, yet not feel as if it was more than three, or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievable; marvelous; stupendous; phenomenal; you understand what I'm getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. It's an adventure all throughout; not only for the protagonists, but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. Each movie was released one year apart of the other, and they're all over 3 hours long. The script is great and so is the directing, and everything else. There is no way this trilogy can disappoint. Definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it."

jay4stein79-1,"Oct 25, 2004",N/A,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy reminds me of something with which I am quite familiar as a long-time denizen of Central New York: a steaming pile of horse manure. You know, that sickly sweet smell, wafting across hills on a summer breeze. Some people find the scent pleasant. I disagree.Likewise with LOTR. It seems Peter Jackson confused everyone into thinking that this series was something epic, something gargantuan, something important. Really, though, it's not. Yes, it is epic and it's long too, but it's not an important cinematic event. In fifty years, I dare say it'll be forgotten along with Titanic. You remember that plate of tripe, don't you? No, by the time I'm lying prostrate on a hospital bed, these three movies will have long been expunged from my memory and the memories of most others.You see, Mr. Jackson somehow forgot to concoct an interesting story when he drafted his endless (and often excruciatingly dull) battle scenes. There is, really, no character development to speak of. Frodo and Sam remain one-dimensional throughout and what depth Jackson gives them is cursory. And the rest? I have a difficult time keeping them straight.I'm sorry, Ringies, this movie just isn't that good. Maybe it's the glossy coating. See, I love Star Wars and, to be fair, many of the criticisms I've leveled against LOTR could also be leveled against George Lucas' films. Oh, and when I say Star Wars, I speak of the original trilogy. Yet, for all it's craftsmanship, the original Star Wars films were sort of clunky. You could tell that they were models made by hand, sets made by hand, costumes made by hand. It looked like a B-movie and felt like a B-movie and it was a B-movie, albeit one with great set design, costumes, effects, etc. LOTR really is a B-movie as well. Or at least it would have been 50 years ago. Yet, in today's market, it gets gussied up, made into an A-picture and it doesn't deserve it. I'm sorry, I just don't find this movie all that good and you'll never convince me otherwise.5/10 - Three points for tree-beard or whatever his name is and two for the ambition to even film it."
eric-junk,"Aug 10, 2004",6/10,"I can't believe this movie won so many Oscars. Sure it was technically sound and all but damn was it boring. This is one of the few movies I have been tempted to walk out of. The last movie I walked out of was Spawn if that gives you any idea how little I enjoyed this movie. Its not that I don't have the attention span, some of my favorite movies are ""7 Samurai"" and ""The Great Escape"". I think we have all been brainwashed or maybe just starved for a good fantasy movie to come along.Anyways, for all the technical achievements and production value I give it 6/10.Please don't make ""The Hobbit""."
TheOtherFool,"Sep 10, 2004",4/10,"Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10."
h-28658,"Mar 17, 2020",10/10,"The Return of the King after the two towers to me felt like a fantastic comeback, instead of lurking around certain scenes like the previous installment did at times, the return of the king dives right into the main focus of what is to come. Leading up to possibly one of the grandest wars in film history, its epic, its beautiful and poetic and certainly emotional."
ronakkotian,"Jul 31, 2020",10/10,"It's very rare for the third film in a series to be good but The Return of the King has surpassed that and managed to become the best film in the LOTR trilogy.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King shows Aragorn, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship getting ready to fight Sauron's army whilst Frodo and Sam approach Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring once and for all.It has all led to this. A 3 hour and 20 minute finale to end the Lord of the Rings story and it couldn't be better. This is my favourite out of all three films as I believe Peter Jackson has crafted one of the best finales to a film ever. It's amazing how much effort and work has gone into this trilogy as this film wouldn't have the same impact if the previous two weren't planned so well. All three films have such a fantastic connection with one another. A huge amount of credit goes to the entire team working on all three films.The Return of the King is the best one as this one ups the ante. If you thought the battle at the end of The Two Towers was impressive, the battle in this film is breathtaking. The fabulous camerawork, special effects and magnitude of the fight makes this a cinematic achievement. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and Howard Shore's epic score increases the intensity of the fight. I was in complete awe as nothing of this scale has been done before. I'm so happy the Academy recognised the work put into it.It's not just the fights that make this film perfect but the characters are fully developed here and given great closure. This film brings the most development to the Hobbits especially Pippin, Frodo and Sam. Pippin really grows in this film after realising what's going on and Billy Boyd did an excellent job. The friendship between Frodo and Sam developed so much here. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were so good. Once again each actor shines and give outstanding performances.With The Return of the King, Peter Jackson has successfully created a perfect and memorable trilogy that set a new standard for filmmaking. Each scene builds up to an epic finale and ending that may make you cry. J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud!"
ThereelscoopwithKK,"Oct 2, 2024",10/10,"This film caps off the greatest trilogy ever made and nothing has even come close to it since. It is incredible the amount of effort put into the entire trilogy. Having to watch Rings of Power now is simply a reminder of just how incredible and fortunate we were to be delivered these movies by Jackson and this cast. This final film is no exception. The only problem it has is that you are so engaged for its entire length that you are worn out and exhausted by the end. In fact it is likely that you had just recently completed the first two films adding onto that exhaustion and to make matters worse it's probably your 50th time doing the marathon. All of this is of course a compliment and not a complaint.These films are the ultimate battle of good versus evil. They make no effort to try to explain away why evil is the way it is and instead hammers home the message that sometimes compromise can't and shouldn't be pursued and that it takes strong, brave, and courageous characters working together to put a stop to the spread of evil.There is absolutely nothing about this movie I would change. The casting, plot, script, action, cinematography are all simply perfection."

jaspercobar,"Sep 17, 2023",10/10,"Lord of the rings return of the king, is breathtaking. It brought the book to life, and made it better. It was super lengthy, but I honestly liked it that way. It means it had time for a lot of epic events, and the battles could be longer. It also made it more emotional, dragging out the ending, it wrapped up well. It is the best movie I have seen in a few months. I had already seen it before 5 years ago, and I don't remember loving it. So my expectations weren't that high, but it was amazing. I guess the movie is just a bit sophisticated for an 8 year old, but brilliant for a 13 year old. At times the C. G. I was pretty bad, but the action, the cast, the story, the emotion, the scenery, the acting, and the charisma of Pippin, and Gollum were perfect."
gheremond,"Aug 19, 2015",10/10,"Just like the book it was based on, the third Lord of the Rings movie towers above its siblings and brings the series to a cataclysmic conclusion, in every sense of the word. From its gigantic battle sequences, to its heartbreaking personal moments, Return of the King redefines what is possible in cinema and sets the impossible bar every other masterpiece must be measured against from now on. Clocking in at almost 3 and a half hours in its theatrical cut, it covers most of the material in the book and wins every point for its immensely satisfying coda. Howard Shore gets another two Oscars and Jackson and co are finally paid their dues. I have never been happier on an Oscar night."
Brunisande,"Dec 5, 2020",10/10,"It's nostalgic, can't help it!
It's very well done. It has nice special effects, characters, aged well, and is a epic end to a really good trilogy.
It's so epic."
stevesky-15087,"Feb 5, 2022",10/10,"As I'm writing this I can't quite believe that this was 20 years ago. I've seen these three films a gazillion times and regularity watch them at least once a year. The Two Towers is my favourite and when Retun came out I didn't like the ending... mostly because I think I was just sad to realise it was all over but also because the last half hour feels like it has about three endings and keels going. But now regard it as pure perfection. I don't think a film series can be beaten for music, script or acting. It's masterful in all three. I think we can forgive Jackson for the few directing failings along the way, the. Man had a lot on his plate lol. But seriously I'll be watching these films forever. Simply The GOAT. If you don't love these movies then you seriously have no soul. And if you've read the books you'll know that it was a near impossibly task to make them at all. Jackson has pulled of the seemingly impossible."
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"May 29, 2004",N/A,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn the concluding adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy,Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) head with Gollum to Mount Doom to dispose of the troublesome ring,whilst the rest of the gang brace themselves for the final battle for Middle Earth.Having put my achy,fidgety,restless bum through the ordeal of the first two movies,I found it only fitting to watch the concluding part (which would be the longest part at a whopping 201 minutes!!!)Luckily,I happened to be watching this one on DVD as opposed to at the cinema and was therefore free to press the pause button at any moment I deemed appropriate in order to take a break and watch it entirely at my own pace.I would certainly only deem it advisable to watch this at a cinema that has a break for refreshments halfway through.I think my school of thought all along really has been that of a fair few others.If you were a fan of the books,then these movies will probably be the equivalent of a wet dream come to life.If you have never read any of the books,however,it's all likely to emerge as a big overblown,self indulgent affair,as I think sadly has been the case with me.The ending especially here is a real nerve grater,as it appears to come again and again after over three hours of patient sitting and observing,only to keep droning on that bit longer.Given the heavy handedness of it all anyway,it just makes for even more of a labourious experience.In the movie's favour,it is a bit more emotionally involving than the last two and manages to draw you in to the plot a bit more,although that may just be because you know a bit more what to expect and so you've resigned yourself to it that bit more.The battle scenes and cinematography in general are certainly nothing to sniff at either.This is,giving away from some laughable and not entirely convincing acting indeed.But,given how little the story had already engrossed me to this point,it's all a bit too little too late.It may have reached #4 on the IMDB top 100,but given I don't know a 'hobbit from a racehorse',it's best use in my favour would seem to be as the ultimate late-night cure for insomnia.**"
pjmuck,"May 11, 2004",7/10,"I am less enamored with this one then I was with the previous two films (particularly Two Towers, which is my favorite), though I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that had I seen this film on it's own without the previous prequels, I may have given it a higher rating.No doubt about it, these films are revolutionary and the pinnacle of fantasy film making, but I just found this one a little tiring. You more or less generally know how it's going to turn out anyway (good guys will get their butts kicked a few times, but will prevail after many long, tedious battles later), so I guess I can't blame the film for delivering exactly what I expected in a final chapter, but I guess I found the journey to get there (first two movies) far more interesting than the end result. After a while, all the eye candy of CGI-created battles gets a bit tiring to look at.So I'll give it a 10 for craftsmanship and artistry, but a 7 for holding my interest."
hanzy_boy,"Jan 3, 2005",5/10,"The Oscar big pay off was, I thought, nothing but a pity courtesy hand clap, while they left the way-better deserving Mystic River in the dust. It's hard to deny the great panorama the movie generated, the 1000 minute-long battle scene, the over sized elephants. but the cliché, flat dialogs that should be the spine of the movie, turned out to be an arthritis, that made me, as an audience, gasped and itched like I just saw one of those lifetime-channel original movie. There was no real great dramatic acting, all actors seem weary and only put on one emotion, and unlike the excellent first part of LOTR, where they have frodo, an average-joe hobbit turned into the ultimate ring bearer, puzzled and over bared by this new-found strenuous job he now has, the drama is alive by other characters struggle to convince frodo and themselves to defeat their own fear to fight for humanity. I like to see more of that than the battle scenes, and this I thought was a huge loss. And lest us not forget the gazillion endings return of the king has."

anmol-30897,"Nov 8, 2025",10/10,"It comprises of friendship, courage, humour, honor, action, bravery, emotions and sense of community and everything. Thank you so much for the movie.The Lord of the Rings stands as one of the greatest trilogies ever created, a timeless masterpiece that embodies everything beautiful about storytelling and humanity. It is not merely a fantasy tale - it is a profound journey that celebrates friendship, courage, honor, and the unyielding spirit of hope. Through its rich characters and breathtaking world, it reminds us of the power of unity and the strength that lies within even the smallest of hearts.At its core, the trilogy is about the bonds that hold us together. The Fellowship represents more than just a quest; it symbolizes trust, loyalty, and the idea that every individual, no matter how humble, has a role to play in shaping the fate of the world. The courage of Frodo, the loyalty of Sam, the wisdom of Gandalf, the nobility of Aragorn, and the resilience of all who fought against the darkness speak to timeless human virtues.What makes The Lord of the Rings truly special is how it blends epic adventure with deep emotion. It is filled with moments of bravery and sacrifice, laughter and tears, triumph and loss. The humor of the hobbits balances the gravitas of the war, while the breathtaking battles are matched by quiet moments of reflection and love.Beyond the fantasy, it teaches that even in the darkest times, hope must never be abandoned. It reminds us that courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to face it. The trilogy captures everything - action, emotion, humor, honor, and a profound sense of community.Thank you, J. R. R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson, for creating this extraordinary world. The Lord of the Rings will forever remain a beacon of storytelling brilliance and a celebration of all that makes us human."

theguys1,"Jun 27, 2005",9/10,"Let me explain the action sequences in the first two Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there wasn't much action, just mostly running. In The Two Towers, it was fighting without much gore included. The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie. But this had excellent special effects and fight scenes. This is a movie that will thoroughly spend 200 minutes of your time, and it's usually hard to find a movie like that. This movie is rare, adventurous, and enjoyable. Not a kid's movie."
gorkilll,"Apr 22, 2007",N/A,"Worth seeing again and again. The extended cut is better, but the movie itself is a true masterpiece, and will forever be a great movie. I thought the picture of the movie, for the time it was made was breathtaking. All the characters had great actors, the director was great. It is sad to see the series end, and to know that there is nothing left to add in the series. A masterpiece, a grand movie. A definite movie to eat popcorn with, a movie to watch with friends, a movie to watch with the family, a movie to cherish forever. It is a magical adventure, a great conclusion, a wonderful experience to witness, a breathtaking masterpiece, and a grand movie!"
Bigbert,"May 9, 2004",6/10,"So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off.Here again only half the movie is interesting.  The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day.It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do)."
Inakaguy,"Apr 18, 2004",2/10,"The conclusion to what has been a seriously overhyped trilogy.  As of the time of writing, this movie was rated #4 in IMDB's top 250.  However, I suspect that much of that rating is due to overexcited fanboys (I hate that word but couldn't think of a substitute), and the film will slip a considerable number of places in subsequent years.Return of the King is probably the second best of the three films, surpassing the lackluster ""Two Towers"" but nowhere near as good as ""The Fellowship"".  I enjoyed the first half of the film considerably and was prepared to accept it as a good final installment.Unfortunately, like ""The Two Towers"", the film moves from the sublime to the ridiculous with the introduction of the battle scene.I'm afraid I am not a fan of CG animation in live films.  While the character of Gollum was well produced, the CG in the battles in lackluster and obvious.  It is like being slapped in the face whenever it appears.Even leaving out the CG however, the biggest insult I find is that the main characters have to do everything.  This was a particular problem in ""The Two Towers"", where the three heroes held off a whole army of orcs, but it is also prevalent in the battle in this movie.Sure, I've heard of suspension of disbelief, but it can only go so far.Unlike most people, I didn't mind the long ending with Sam and Frodo but the film had already been ruined for me before that."
vip_ebriega,"Oct 11, 2007",10/10,"My Take: The best of the best. An unforgettable grand-scale epic.""This is it"", director Peter Jackson might have said. ""This is the film where the name Peter Jackson will be remembered for."" Indeed, it is. The phrase ""Save the best for last"" has never been so evident. And not since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK have we had a sequel that outdoes an original that is too powerful to defeat. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a sequel the third movie in the series of adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling novels including THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, two very strong box-office hits that aren't easily topped from the highest spot. But, surprisingly, it was (by this film, no less). But still, all three films act like one big epic of a movie that's just plain beautiful, exciting and enjoyable to watch.The film continues the events where THE TWO TOWERS left off, having not much separate characters to focus on. This time, it only have the escapades of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood, companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol (voiced by Andy Serkis) on their quest for the gates of Mordor and continue their mission to destroy the One Ring. On the other end, we have Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the people of Rohan fighting for glory against the forces of Mordor who has besieged the capital city of Gondor, ruled by a treacherous ruler (John Noble), a typical stereotype of a cowardly ruler.Director (Jackson) doesn't disappoint the fans he has earned with the series he created. Of course he shows new special-effects advancements in the brilliant battle sequences, lots of creative creatures and outlandish settings, but he also keeps a strong direction, brilliant performances from the cast and other stylish works behind the camera. Films like this come ones in a full moon, but Jackson does such a great job, he succeeds to make such a rare and min-blowing achievement.Here I am, brainstorming one of the best films of the last few years and I'll make sure that the LOTR series is there, with THE RETURN OF THE KING on the top spot of the entire series.Rating: ***** out of 5."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Feb 18, 2023",10/10,"It's just incredible how well Return of the King wraps up the overall Lord of the Rings trilogy. Things expand and branch off in wild directions in The Two Towers, likely making first-time viewers pessimistic it could all come together. But come together it most certainly does, with The Return of the King delivering spectacle, emotion, and large-scale action that few other blockbusters have come close to equaling in the 20 years since its release.Instead of gushing endlessly about things other people have already gushed about (I agree with all the positive things anyone has said), all I can really add is that the extended editions made me love The Return of the King even more. Even though the theatrical version is still about 200 minutes long, numerous great scenes didn't make the cut. Seeing them back in for a final installment that now spans 4+ hours really makes everything gel better. It made a great film into a fantastic one.I used to feel like the various endings of The Return of the King took too long. After watching all three movies as effectively one movie - and doing all the extended versions in one go to boot - the ending feels just as well-paced as the rest of the movie. All the scenes in the epilogue feel earned and truly emotional. The longer journey spent with these characters seems to make all the difference, and I feel like generally speaking, the extended versions are probably superior overall (though there's a scene or two here and there that feels superfluous for sure).Anyway, The Return of the King is fantastic. The whole trilogy is fantastic. I don't know how Peter Jackson and everyone else made such a big trilogy that all works so well. It holds up after 20+ years, and I'm starting to wonder whether it will ever even age at this point."
troy-90336,"Mar 22, 2021",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a masterpiece in visual storytelling and for me they are the greatest movies ever made.

manalone923,"Jan 21, 2004",10/10,"Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like ""gets everything right"", and ""I enjoyed every minute of it"", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving ""Into the West"" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends.  The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored.If for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet:  As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to."
Peter_Gunz,"Dec 28, 2003",10/10,"First, no storyline description is needed for this movie, seeing as how the majority of the known universe has seen it.  Second, I have read the books, thoroughly and repeatedly, so I may offer my humble opinions on the film's comparable continuity.In short, this movie cannot be topped.  By anything.  Ever. Period.But since this section is meant for me to voice my opinions, I will justify my judgment.  Peter Jackson had his work cut out for him when he took up this task with New Line as his backer, mainly because it is a presold product.  The LOTR books have a following second to none, and failure on Jackson's part would likely have led to his assassination by an overzealous Tolkienite.  However, he has performed admirably, and has managed to stay as close to the literate plot as possible.  There are several jagged details which cause me to cringe every time I encounter them on the silver screen, but as a whole, I remain nonetheless satisfied.  The most obvious of these is the romantic subplot.  While I am by no means sexist, I believe that this subplot was added simply to keep female viewers who had not read the books interested.  Arwen and Eowyn's romantic involvement with Aragorn in the books is no more than a passing mention, if that.  There are no long dialogues between Aragorn and Arwen, and there are no dreamlike telepathic connections.  In this matter, Peter Jackson certainly took some creative liberties, but I suppose it did help romanticize the plot slightly.  But only slightly. I have several other small complaints about altered plots and over-dramatization, but I will continue to annoy my friends and relatives with these, instead of subjecting the worldwide audience to my extremist scrutiny.The CGI effects of this movie are mindblowing.  The Battle of the Pelennor Fields will stand out in cinematic history as the crowning jewel of combat sequences.  It will be many years, and many failed attempts before this battle will be paralleled, nonetheless succeeded of it's title.  Also, no doubt through the aid and constant vigil of the Official LOTR Fanclub (who always had Jackson's ear) I often found myself thinking ""that was exactly how I imagined it"", and was very pleased and even surprised by how accurate he had done his craft.  As for Gollum, what can I say, but that he was a continuation of perfection from The Two Towers.  I especially enjoyed how it further explained Smeagol's past, and his finding of The One Ring.Now some quick ratings.  Some of these may spoil their appearance in the movie for some, so be warned.Gollum: ASiege of Minas Tirith: A+The Oathbreakers (Ghost Army): A+Death of the Witch King: A-Arwen: CFrodo and Sam's ""relationship"": BFilm length: A (will be explained)That is one matter I feel I should address.  These books were written in a time when it was completely acceptable for one man to say to another that he loved him, strictly in a platonic way.  Leave your homophobic inhibitions outside the theatre, and please do not say lewd comments during what should be rather emotional scenes.The other major source of much moaning and groaning in the theatre is the length of the film.  Yes, it is three and a half hours.  Yes, that is a long movie.  Yes, you knew how long it was when you bought the ticket.  No, other people do not want to hear you moan about how long it is.  And finally, yes, Peter Jackson stayed as close to the books as possible.  The storyline does drag on near the end of the books, so by making the movie similar to the books, Peter Jackson was simply doing his directorial duty.  These books mean a lot to a lot of people, and if he had sold them short on what (for many people) are the most influential novels of their lives, he would not be a very good film maker would he.  Peter Jackson had an enormous task ahead of him, and he most likely had two main challenges on his mind during production.  First, to satisfy the already obsessed LOTR fanbase; second, to captivate the part of the audience who do not live and breathe LOTR. There is a fantastic volume of story to be told on those pages, and much of it has been left out from the movies, leaving only the core events and their inspired emotions.  Had Jackson not trimmed them down to where they are now, each movie would easily surpass twelve hours.  Easily.  It is a minor miracle that Jackson was able to convert such a literary masterpiece from pages to picture, and the audience should be pleased by its creation, not moan every fifteen seconds waiting for it to end.All in all, Return of the King was a flawless finale to a fantastic trilogy. Few trilogies can boast the numbers that LOTR can, and still remain captivating when it comes to it's end.  Return of the King is a shoe-in for Best Picture at the Oscars, and will likely sweep the globe in a flurry of well-known and not-so well-known awards. Despite my gripes over minor details and plot alterations (Where's good ol' Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs?), I know cinematic perfection when I see it.  That is why I gave this film a ten."

rebeljenn,"Jan 18, 2006",10/10,"'Return of the King' was one of the best films that I have seen in a long while, and it has helped to fill a void and get audiences more interested in fantasy films. Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films.The main problem that I did have with this film is the lack of an answer regarding the evil wizard. In fact, this was cut completely from the cinema release. The wizard was the face of evil in the previous two films, and he suddenly disappears, leaving an empty and unexplained face of evil. Despite that, the film is excellent in every other way."
pere-25366,"Oct 15, 2017",10/10,"What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect.With the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life.Through this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion.And perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling ""You Shall Not Pass!"", The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings!Above all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a ""fantasy"" epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved."
jesse-115,"Oct 7, 2004",8/10,"Let me say first that after seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I went out and read the LOTR trilogy for the first time. I enjoyed it immensely, but I only read it once and not before I saw the first movie. So I might not be what you'd consider a true enthusiast.From an Enthusiasts perspective:There were a few disappointing momemts: the fact that Gandalf *still* didn't break Sarumon's staff on screen, and the way a lot of things were glossed over a bit. Additionally, there was way too much Legolas jumping around during battles. I understand they cost $9 million to make and not showing them would be effectively ""wasting"" $9 million, but there are more important things to show.Finally, and this was known very early on so it wasn't a surprise, the conclusion of the trilogy was completely removed. This trilogy began and ended with the Hobbits. It began by exposing them as lovable but helpless characters, and ended showing them to be courageous and capable of addressing significant problems. The movies, however, focused a little more on the characters people love, and while I don't fault them for that, I do fault them for not trying to show the ending of the trilogy in any way whatsoever. As an enthusiast, I can't grade the movie on its own; I must rate it as a trilogy. And this trilogy would get 9.5 / 10.From Joe's perspective:Joe wouldn't be nearly as acquanted with the characters, and a lot of what this movie succeeds on for the enthusiasts plays off of that. This is still a good movie, if a bit broken up giving far too many ""it's wrapping up"" signals. Frodo spends far too much time crying (honestly, this dragged on), and the characters spend far too much time saying ""farewell."" Joe liked the movie, but gave it a 7.0 / 10 because there are movies he simply enjoys more."
Padddy_,"Apr 7, 2022",9/10,"Every time I read that a series or movie cannot fully or somewhat faithfully translate a book, I am reminded of the LOFTR movies a great adaptation of a great literary classic, the atmosphere and the plot are well outlined and well adapted for the film, great performances, beautiful cinematography, beautiful scenery, beautiful music for me the LOFRT trilogy is ALMOST PERFECT."
bellino-angelo2014,"Dec 6, 2022",10/10,"As I said in the reviews for the previous two chapters, I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of ther reputation and many reviews. The first was great and a nice introduction, the second, while not outstanding, still good in some ways and the third... too great that it's a shame that you can't rate a movie with a score higher than 10, it's too damn perfect!After a prologue that shows us the origins of Gollum we join Gandalf, Eomer, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (Ian McKellen, Karl Urban, Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom) that on the way to Isengard meet Merry and Tuc (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) that tell them about Treebeard that won against Saruman who is now imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf then goes to Denethor for preparing him for Sauron's attack but Denethor is insane because his son Boromir (Sean Bean) died: in the meanwhile Frodo, Samwise (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) and Gollum arrive to Minas Morgul where Gollum makes Frodo believe that Sam wants the precious ring, but Sam will save Frodo from a giant spider. After a long battle Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and the army of the dead ogres arrive to Gondor, and now they don't have any other choice than go to Mordor, so that Frodo can go to Mount Doom for destroying the ring. Frodo is attacked by the ogres only to be saved by Sam, and can finally throw the ring in the lava despite a fight with Gollum. After the ring melts, the army or Mordor goes away and Sauron's spirit is defeated forever. Frodo and Sam are saved by the eagles and are taken to Gondor, and the day after in Minas Tirith there is the crowning of Aragorn as the new king and the celebration of his wedding with Arwen (Liv Tyler). In the end we see Bilbo finishing his book and Frodo decides to travel with the last elves left to Valinor.The sets are huge and spectacular at the same time, and the money was spent well for the scope. The performances by all (Mortensen, Bloom, Astin, Cate Blanchett, Wood, McKellen, Tyler and Rhys Davies) were all the great, and the soundtrack was on par with all the other settings. I especially loved the song OVER THE HORIZON by Annie Lennox towards the end credits, it was that great. The battle scenes and special effects were marvellous considering it was made in 2003.Overall, a must for fans of the trilogy and besides that, a masterpiece that has to be seen at least once for its greatness, it's that powerful!"
braddugg,"Sep 8, 2016",10/10,"This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date.There are many reasons why this is the greatest. The visual effects were spectacular and they have increased the scope of any film. This film took the film-making to new heights which were previously not thought of. Peter Jackson for this very reason became one of the greatest filmmakers ever.The beginning is very simple, and it takes us to the backstory of the ring. The battle scenes are nothing short of epic. The culmination is happy and this has a feel good ending. everything is so perfectly commercial on the face of it. But, to tell it the way it has been told is stupendous.The acts by all, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Austin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn are the most memorable for me. These are characters I shall not forget ever in my lifetime.The writing by JRR Tolkein is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such visual strength to the celluloid would have been the greatest challenge for any filmmaker. Just happy that Peter Jackson did his bit in bringing one of the greatest fantasy novels to the public reach, He actually did a great service by doing so. He served the book readers and the film viewers hugely.Thanks to all, who have made this film and the trilogy a possibility and I am going with 5/5. Nothing less for one of the greatest films."
Lathspell,"Jan 2, 2004",N/A,"This movie, the conclusion of Peter Jackson's epic film series based on the Tolkien novels of the same name, was fairly good on the whole. However, having read the books beforehand, I was disappointed at several aspects of this movie.1. The Pyre of Denethor. This was my favorite scene in the book, but PJ mangled it. Instead of having Denethor kneel down on the pyre with his palantir, he leaped off of a battlement. This, while hilarious, was outrageous also. It was funnier than most parodies, and that's bad. It also seemed rushed, whereas in the book, time was taken.2. The Wild Men. I don't know why, but this exclusion got my goat. I guess I just liked the Wild Men, Ghan-Buri-Ghan saying ""Kill gorgun!"" and the fact that they still used a few big words. Maybe I'm just a purist.3. The Mouth of Sauron. His exclusion irritated me also, and I hear it will be on the EE (Extended Edition), so I guess that's something to look forward to.4. SARUMAN! Why, oh, why cut his scene? Wormtongue as well. Those were two of the best characters! 'Nuff said.5. Orcs. I was disappointed with the portrayal of the orcs, especially Shagrat and Gorbag (who are never called by name, along with Grishnakh and Ugluk from TTT). It seemed as if every orc line was yelled. Can't an orc merely talk? Shagrat and Gorbag were, again, two of the best characters. Tolkien's orcs were surprisingly sophisticated, and here they are reduced to yelling, angry simpletons. They even discuss post-war plans in Tolkien. Therefore, it was disappointing, except the cockney orc in TTT. ""Why cahn't we 'ave some meat?""6. Eowyn and Faramir. The love story is gone, and Eowyn is not as disguised as she should be (in the Battle.) Obviously it was filmed but cut, since the two look at each other at Aragorn's coronation.So, it was a good movie with a few flaws."
Andy C-2,"Jul 9, 2004",7/10,"Ok just to clear something up. Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life.I guess thats why the genre is called fantasy."
jacobjohntaylor1,"Aug 13, 2014",10/10,The hobbit movies are better. But it is still all the middle earth movies are good. This movie as a great story line.

It is long but so fast past that you will not notes. You could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. This is a great movie.

See it see it see it see it see it see it see it. Some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.
Elvis-Del-Valle,"Nov 1, 2025",10/10,"Having reached the final chapter of this trilogy, there is no doubt that The Lord of the Rings proved to be one of the finest works of fantasy cinema and the most perfect film trilogy ever made. This was possible because Peter Jackson developed these films as if they were a single movie and only divided it into three. It was too risky for the production company, since making a film and its sequels simultaneously carried the risk of losses if any of the movies flopped. So there was a lot at stake, but the outcome was quite positive. This proves that a saga works very well if everything is planned from the outset. Something that few sagas-such as The Godfather, Scream, The Matrix, Harry Potter, or Star Wars-were able to achieve with their first installments. In the case of The Lord of the Rings, the gamble paid off quite well, and it finally concluded with what is undoubtedly the best installment of the entire trilogy.Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 2003, Return of the King picks up where The Two Towers left off, adapting the final moments that conclude the third and fourth books of the novel. It also features a prolog that explains Gollum's origins and his first encounter with the Ring. This was something Gandalf had explained in the novel when he and his companions were in the Mines of Moria. It was already noticeable that a couple of scenes had been rearranged when adapting the novel. In this case, they decided to leave Gollum's origin for the final film. The previous film already hinted at something terrible in Gollum's past that drove him to madness. In this film, they explain what happened and how Smeagol went from being a pure hobbit to an abominable creature. The Two Towers was a preparation for this moment, where the characters face a great challenge to end Sauron's tyranny. Frodo and Sam are close to achieving their final goal. The only thing standing in their way is Gollum. Although he agreed to guide the hobbits, he doesn't hesitate to betray them in order to seize the Ring. Gollum acts in a more manipulative way to separate the hobbits now that Frodo trusts him. At this point, Frodo turns out to have been deceived, and Sam was right to suspect Gollum from the start. From the very first movie, Sam had been showing devotion and support for Frodo. In this film, it's even more evident that he's a loyal friend willing to protect Frodo. The friendship between them carries more weight in delivering emotional moments when the time comes to bring everything to a close.Like The Two Towers, this film employs three narrative threads that gradually converge toward the climax. The journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum is just one of those threads. The highest priority is preparing Mynas Tirith for the battle against the orcs. Here we meet Denethor and begin to see the difficult relationship Faramir has with his father. To Denethor, Boromir was a fairly worthy son, and Faramir never received the appreciation he deserved. Knowing the character, it's very clear that Faramir is much nobler than Boromir, but his father doesn't recognize that and only wants someone who is loyal. Merry is the only one who empathizes with Faramir and values him for his nobility. One noticeable difference here from the novel is that Merry accompanies Gandalf, whereas in the book it was Pippin who did so. The moment when Faramir wakes up was also changed. While in the movie it happens out of nowhere, in the novel it occurs when Aragorn gives him athelas leaves. The film also omits the final battle that takes place in the Shire, which is understandable since the movie had already reached its limit by the time the final battle in Mordor occurred. For that reason, Saruman's final fate was moved to the beginning of the film.Even so, the film delivers the epic battle that makes this the thrilling final chapter everyone was hoping to see. For that, the remaining narrative thread also plays an important role, in which Aragorn must now assume the role he had been trying to avoid his entire life. Now that his true identity has been revealed, Aragorn has been destined to take the throne that Denethor has long been guarding. Aragorn felt he didn't deserve to ascend the throne because of what Isildur had done. But now that the moment of truth is drawing near, Aragorn has no choice. He must fulfilll his destiny not only to atone for his ancestor's mistake, but also to save his loved ones. Arwen even abandons her journey to the Undying Lands to be with her beloved, and that puts her at risk. Aragorn is willing to save those he loves, even if he must accept the fate he has tried so hard to evade. In this narrative thread, Théoden accepts fighting for Gondor, demonstrating his honor as king. Éowyn gets involved by proving herself worthy of the battlefield, something she'd wanted since the previous film. Legolas and Gimli are already established companions. Although they still compete, their brotherhood is undeniable. This narrative thread is what leads to the dissolution of the Battle of Mynas Tirith, and once these two threads finally converge, they guide the remaining narrative thread to conclude this thrilling epic.The film is undoubtedly the epic conclusion everyone was hoping to see, and it brings closure to the arcs of many of its characters. The thrilling and profound narrative isn't the only thing that makes this film a heartwarming experience. Weta FX's special effects also deliver the thrilling conclusion to this saga. The combat scenes are very captivating, and there's plenty of action that delivers an authentic cinematic experience. This is very reminiscent of epic films like The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur, and Quo Vadis. The most memorable action moments are the confrontation with Shelob, the fight against the leader of the Nazgûl, the battle against the oliphaunts, the battle in Mordor, and the final climax at Mount Doom. The Army of the Dead also deserves an honorable mention, as its design draws heavily from the spirits in The Frighteners. Howard Shore's soundtrack is also a marvel in the epic and emotional moments that are brimming with emotion. The conclusion ends up being something beautiful that makes everything seen in the trilogy a truly worthwhile experience.Peter Jackson has come a long way from the bizarre cinema that brought him to this moment. His style is no longer what it was in his early days, but he managed to create one of the greatest epic works in cinema. The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the best final chapter ever created for a trilogy. Something very important to close out this trilogy that began with high expectations and ends on a grand scale. Despite its differences from the novel, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings has become the best adaptation of Tolkien's work and one of the greatest masterpieces of fantasy cinema. My final rating for this movie is 10/10."
goldbugruffid,"May 17, 2018",10/10,"As a huge fan of the books (I must have read the Lord Of the Rings 15 times as a kid), i was sceptical about how this series of movies would go. I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw the movies, and Peter Jackson absolutely nailed this one.The characters were perfectly cast, the screenplay was amazing, and the scenery was outstanding.
I could not recommend this enough"
TheUnknown837-1,"May 28, 2007",9/10,"And so, Jackson fulfills his vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle-earth and he does so with breathtaking detail and near-flawless artistic craftsmanship. Both previous entries of Jackson's epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy were spectacular achievements. ""Return of the King"" is an eleven Academy Award-winning movie and I suppose it's very worthy of such a title. It pretty much has won all of its Oscars for the entire trilogy, finally scoring big in the Best Picture category. Box office was also incredible, this film is the second biggest hit worldwide, just barely behind James Cameron's superb film ""Titanic"".""Return of the King"" is the conclusion of the trilogy. The stories of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Aragorn, and the others comes to a close as the characters all meet their fates. The final battle against the dreaded Sauron begins and there are numerous, almost countless battle sequences throughout the film using combinations of live-action actors in costumes and makeup, and state-of-the-art flawless visual effects created through months of hard work. The giant deranged elephants, trolls, and the sadistic Gollum are all incredibly convincing despite the fact that they are simply an illusion put on the film screen. Sometimes you might be able to guess that they are CGI, but Jackson's skills at directing a medieval battle sequence draws you into the action too much to pay any attention to the detail of the graphics. And you have to look hard to find any possible flaws or weak points.The Lord of the Rings is an amazing film trilogy, definitely one the best, ranking amongst others such as ""Star Wars"". ""Return of the King"" is an amazing achievement as well. Perhaps its only flaw is the excessive running time at nearly four hours in length. Still, that does not make it a disappointment in any way. That is unless you want it to be extremely faithful to Tolkien's original work. For me, it's a great movie."
ANGRYSPNGGAMER55,"Oct 27, 2025",10/10,"I would lie and you would lie if we said that this movie isn't the best of it's kind. Everything is perfect in this movie. Every single thing. Any tiny issues the 2 previous movies might have had, this movie erases them completely and takes the advantages of the previous 2 and skyrockets them making a movie that will be written with gold letters in the entertainment history book. A beautiful story that ends so amazingly well that you just CAN'T but say this movie is one of the very best out there. I won't speak in detail because all 3 movies are spectacular and whatever it is to be said you will understand it. Briefly the movie's cinematography is literally otherwordly and it speaks it's messages through it (something that I absolutely adore), the special effects and the looks of the trilogy in general are 24 years old and haven't aged a single minute and the acting...Jesus christ the acting is magnificent. Anyone who considers himself a living being should watch this trilogy and this movie specifically."
pyrocitor,"Sep 24, 2008",10/10,"As the saying goes, ""All good things must come to an end"", but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics.Debate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease.Only in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel.But even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling ""GO AWAY, TROLL"" at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless.Capturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance.The forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Théoden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen.Such praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can.-10/10"
chiragrathod09,"Jul 21, 2024",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just the conclusion of a trilogy; it is a breathtaking culmination of an epic journey that resonates deeply within the human spirit. Peter Jackson's masterful direction and the creative prowess behind this cinematic odyssey bring to life J. R. Tolkien's timeless tale of courage, sacrifice, and the persistent glimmer of hope amid despair.The Return of the King envelops the audience in a tapestry of emotion and grandeur. The film's scope is staggering, drawing viewers into the climactic battle for the fate of Middle-earth. The sheer scale of the battles, particularly the Siege of Minas Tirith, is both a technical marvel and a poignant reflection of the struggle between light and darkness. Each clash of swords and every charging cavalry echo the weight of choices made, reminding us that heroism isn't just about valor on the battlefield, but also the relentless fight against the encroaching shadows of despair.At its heart, The Return of the King is a profound exploration of friendship and loyalty. The evolving dynamics among Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are a testament to the bonds that can illuminate even the bleakest of paths. Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee is, without question, one of the most moving performances in cinematic history. His unwavering loyalty and heartfelt determination to support Frodo through the darkness encapsulate the very essence of what it means to be a true friend.The film also brilliantly weaves in themes of redemption and sacrifice. Characters like Aragorn step into their destinies with stunning grace, while others confront their own demons, exemplifying the notion that true strength often lies in vulnerability. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn is a masterclass in embodying a reluctant hero, bringing forth an emotional depth that resonates through every moment of conflict and resolution.The Return of the King is nothing short of a masterpiece. Each shot is meticulously crafted, showcasing the vast landscapes of Middle-earth-each location imbued with its own unique story and history. Howard Shore's sweeping score elevates every scene, stirring emotions and evoking the gravitas of the moment, leaving audiences breathless as the powerful themes reach their zenith.As the film reaches its conclusion, viewers are reminded that even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Frodo's journey culminates in a bittersweet farewell, encapsulating the essence of sacrifice and the cost of carrying an enormous burden-a theme that lingers long after the credits roll.In the end, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a film; it is an experience that encapsulates the triumph of hope over despair, the power of friendship, and the beauty of sacrifice. It is an artistic achievement that will be celebrated for generations, a poignant reminder that even in our darkest hours, the light of courage and love can lead us home. This film stands as a glorious testament to the resilience of the human spirit, forever etched in the hearts of those who dare to dream of a better world."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Aug 9, 2005",10/10,"There is no epic like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I have never had a better time seeing this movie in theaters. This breathtaking epic, is the third and last installment in The Lord of the Rings. Sam and Frodo are closer and closer to the cracks of Doom while their journey becomes very dangerous along with their guide Gollum helping. Meanwhile the rest of the fellowship try to stop Sauron's army from taking the ring. The movie is pure magical from beginning to end and the characters are all wonderful. Return of the King went very fast for a three and a half hour movie, mostly because I loved it. I have become very obsessed with the trilogy and if you loved the first two Lord of the Rings, you will definitely love the last one as well.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
Offworld_Colony,"Feb 6, 2020",10/10,"...and although it loses steam in the middle, the spectacular battle, iconic design work and blistering finale pump it all up to the quality of its fore-films.The film is peppered with cool moments, a dawn raid against the archers of Osgiliath has a total dungeons and dragons feel and Gollum is such a schemer and a villain he's toe-curlingly watchable. The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake.Regarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close."
haegint,"Mar 22, 2004",6/10,"I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is ""heavy"" and full of ""meaning"", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen ""oversize"" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this."
dee.reid,"Aug 3, 2005",10/10,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10"
noralee,"Dec 19, 2005",10/10,"""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is a terrific demonstration of CGI and special effects made to serve a thrilling story of good vs. evil.I came in fully expecting that the ""Return of the King"" aspect would be the story line that would draw me in the most, but found that was given short shrift with a lot of that left out from the book, given over more to cinemascope-worthy battles that are the best since the early ""Star Wars"" movies.If I hadn't read the book recently, let alone re-read the appendices several times to be sure I was getting the prophesies and genealogy straight, I would never have figured out what was going on with Aragorn as the heir to Isildur, as much of what he does to convince doubters is missing.I also was a bit disappointed in Viggo not quite living up to ""LOTR: The Two Towers,"" but I don't know if it was his acting or the dialog, especially in his ""rally the troops"" a.k.a. ""another Crispin's Day speech,"" or if I found his traveling down the Paths of the Dead less frightening, and less motivated, than in the book. His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch.Second to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting.I am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well.But the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor.I didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material.Howard Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song.(originally written 12/28/2003)"
aharmas,"Aug 1, 2005",10/10,"Mr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.Just like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.ROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to."
WubsTheFadger,"May 20, 2018",10/10,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe third and finale film in The Lord of the Rings series is the best. Peter Jackson left the best for last in this epic of all epics. The scale of the film is huge and the battles and set pieces are massive. This film is a masterpiece that needs to be experienced. The ending is touching and brought chills.The acting is once again amazing. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, Bruce Hopkins, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and David Wenham are all amazing. I have to stress once again that they are also perfectly cast in this film.The pacing and runtime is perfect.The battles in this film are grand, spectacular, and massive.Pros: Amazing story throughout all three films, a wonderful and touching ending, amazing acting, perfect casting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and the battles are amazingCons: None at allOverall Rating: 10"
MaxBorg89,"Dec 13, 2005",10/10,"It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step.So, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake...Like in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story.Now, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: ""I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!"", probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance.Well, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time.Peter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that."
A_Kind_Of_CineMagic,"Apr 29, 2009",8/10,"A lot of people looking on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comments but I feel justified in saying that the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this final part in particular are possibly some of the most over-rated films of all time! I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too.Most people who loved the books or loves this kind of story understandably lap the films up enthusiastically. An epic, massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and loved fantasy stories is somewhat irresistible to anyone who likes fantasy stories at all. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the films and have remained so with each viewing. They are not bad films at all. They have great spectacle, have some epic action, some scenes with effective humour or emotion and some fine actors but there is a lot I find disappointing. LOTR would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and I don't think these films do it as well as they could. There is a lot of time wasted unnecessarily and important aspects of story and character are left out or underdeveloped.I find Peter Jackson generally a far from 100% successful director. His version of King Kong is poor and shows his faults even a lot more than the LOTR trilogy. All these Jackson made films are a bit overblown and a little pretentiously directed. Extremely long shots of characters gazing into camera, at each other or into the distance occur so often it is incredible. A great director does not need words to tell a story or convey emotion and the face and eyes of an actor can be used to huge effect. But most shots of characters without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they are wasting time! Frodo (Elijah Wood) especially just gazes or gawps for what seems like ages without making me connect with his feelings and without moving the character or story on at all.CGI is the real king in these films and as impressive as many scenes are, it never thrills as much as the real scenery or real action in some older epics. The epic spectacle is therefore not enough to carry me away on its own, it requires great storytelling. Some great storytelling does occur in these films but I do not feel Tolkein's story or characters are done full justice due to Jackson wasting time on 'pretty', glossy, showy film making. A real efficiency and supreme skill was needed to get the most from the source material and this is lacking. For instance, Return of the King misses out important aspects of Aragorn, Feramir and Saruman's stories and I find Frodo comes across as rather petulant, annoying and lacking heroism. Samwise comes across a lot better.A great villain completes a great story. Sauron appears a feeble 'villain' throughout the trilogy. A flaming eye is not exactly Darth Vader! Tolkein created a villain difficult to show effectively on screen and Jackson's presentation of Sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all. Saruman is a good villain and is brilliantly acted by Christopher Lee but has totally insufficient screen time, particularly in the final story where he goes straight to DVD!Overall The Return of the King is easily the weakest of the trilogy for my tastes featuring faults I have listed above, rather overblown CGI action and an extraordinarily dragged out ending.Yes these films are very good but for me they are nowhere near the classics they are reputed to be or that they could have been if perfectly directed."
Afterworlds,"Aug 16, 2004",N/A,"This third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy suffers from the same faults as its two predecessors, namely it is (1) overlong, (2) takes itself way too seriously and is (3) a case of much ado about nothing . ..Three hours in, as it was winding down to its predictable (both in general and specifics) ending, I found that my arse was sore and numb.There was another twenty minutes to go as we are made to sit through one endless coda after the other. Ultimately I felt as empty as we are made to believe some of the main characters are supposed to feel . . . and as empty as the movie itself.And make no mistake: Return of the King is an empty spectacle.Nowhere did any of its characters feel like real people with real emotions  they were simply too nobly self-sacrificing, too evil, etc. for that  they are mere archetypes. To be honest I found myself more emotionally touched by the 80 minutes or so of the recent Pieces of April (shot on digital camera for a mere $160,000) than the entire three hours of the multi-million dollar Return of the King.Don't get me wrong. As far as third installments in movie trilogies go, The Return of the King rates among the best. It is better than Return of the Jedi, definitely better than Matrix Revolutions and nowhere as disappointing as Alien 3. Something tells me that it'd probably be better than the upcoming Star Wars pic (if Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are anything to go by, that is).There can be no denying it: the three Lord of the Rings movies are quite an achievement as far as sheer spectacle and special effects go  they are truly grand to behold.Unfortunately, the battle scenes, as impressive as they may be, become repetitious and after similar scenes in The Two Towers, I began to suspect that maybe the whole series could have skipped an entire movie altogether and still have gotten to the point.And the point being? Well, that's the other problem: it is an epic triumph of special effects wizardry, but in aid of what?Tolkien's massive 1 000 page plus doorstop of a novel also isn't about much really. Its Manichean concepts of good and evil are too simplistic to take seriously. Ideologues who insist that Tolkien's novels are some kind of fascist tract however have it wrong. While they reflect Tolkien's conservatism and dread of modernity (not to mention his racial and chauvinist attitudes), Lord of the Rings is simply something he wrote to pass the time.The movies too will pass the time, but as someone once remarked: the golden age of sci-fi is 13.Thirteen is also the best age at which to have read Tolkien's books. Writer Brian Aldiss mentions in Trillion Year Spree (his excellent history of science fiction) that the success of fantasy novels is due to the absence of the one thing that their adolescent readers are always short of: money. You never see Lord Sauron struggling to make the mortgage payments on any of his huge castles. Or even the dashing Aragorn slapping down a few pence for his drink of ale at the local tavern. Or how about Frodo and Sam never having to pay any toll road fees? Money just never figures in any of these tales, Aldiss says.Aldiss may have been exaggerating, but he has a point: real-life adult issues never feature in Lord of the Rings. Ah, you say, but it is an age old battle of Good versus Evil.Actually, it isn't.Has anyone bothered to figure out why exactly the Orcs would support the evil Lord Sauron? Just what is in it for them? In the novels, the Orcs' non-White (as apartheid apparatchiks would have it) origins are hinted at. In fact, it would seem that the Orcs are the downtrodden untermensch of Middle Earth.Racist overtones aside, just what is gained after all those numerous battles? As the title implies, a monarchy is restored after fighting it out with a dictatorship.Heck, we might as well be talking about the (decidedly undemocratic) Kuwaiti royal family being restored to power after Gulf War I during the early 1990s. Neither are exactly causes to get all excited about. In fact, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has deeper insights into feudalism than all of Tolkien's thick magnum opus. ('Oh, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you!')Also, its seriousness gets wearisome. At some point in the movie my wife started cracking silly jokes, something she never does  anything to break the intermittent tension she later told me.Return of the King is like a small puppy instead of the roaring lion it pretends to be: it wants nothing more than to be liked; and while I admired it greatly, I found that I didn't really like it all that much. Is it a great movie? Absolutely. As good as these LoTR fanatics would have you believe-think ""greatest movie ever made""? Absolutely not. It is easily 8/10, but with all the ignore-flaws-it's-perfect reviews, I felt I would submit this to point out only the opposite."
esteban1747,"Feb 27, 2004",7/10,"Commenting the first part of this novel I said that it was a real message for peace, but I cannot assert the same for this final one . Although technically this film is one of the best in its special effects, it has too many battles which make it sometimes boring, battle after battle with no space to think or to relax. It also amazed me to see that the villain of this story, i.e. Christopher Lee disappeared with no explanation. I was unsuccessfully looking for him in the film, but later learned that even the same Lee is now arguing for the exclusion of his scenes from this film. Why such a exclusion? It is a real mystery. One can guest more or less the rest of the plot, the good boys winning over the evil. In fact the end of the film is like a poem, Frodo has to go to a kind of a sweet death leaving Sam sad. This scene is certainly unexpected and makes you think that death is fatal but can be welcome when good doing has taken place. In any case, my criticism here does not demerit the success of the whole serial of these three films, but the third one should have been the best and it was not."
jshells,"Dec 24, 2003",1/10,"Obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel, but what's worse, a terrible movie.  Lacking flow, sense, linearity and dramatic impact, this played out like a highlights reel, not a coherent story.  The actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given, with some exceptions.  Peter Jackson's only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots, both of which are heartily abused.  And the special effects, for the most part, would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability. There were high points, but this was and is the first and only movie I have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the Eowyn-Nazgul scene.  A hollywood blockbuster?  No Doubt.  A good movie? Hell no.  Possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on?  The fact is, if this were based on real events, I don't think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names. Maybe that wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to hear about Jackson's love of the books, or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material.  There is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books.  This movie could probably have been worse, but I would be hard pressed to know how..."
bberry-1,"May 26, 2005",10/10,"It's a really great masterpieces has a great story.the other two were great too.Peter Jackson is a great director you would say.You, I mat him one year ago at Hollywood. He said about his feeling of the movie.And he said that he think that movie did great and everyone will like it for generations and forever.After that,I started to work at the east Brunswick library to broadcast the channel three news.Anyway, the movie is like a really great action,drama,and adventure movie to watch.It's not like the first two movies, It's better than the other. So, for all you movie fans out there, I hope you have a great time on IMDb.com."
leppard33,"May 23, 2005",10/10,"I really liked this movie in my opinion I would think this is the best movie ever, I really like how Frodo (Elijah Wodd) and Sam (Sea Astin) were looking out for each other Sam was always there to help Frodo, o ya and I liked the battle to I really liked how they faced the Orks they won that battle thanks to Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) ya When he fought them with his soul Army and destroyed them all. o ya and another thing that I liked was when that Eye got Destroyed after Frodo burned the Ring it looked nice how it broke down. Thanx Peter Jackson Ur the best the is the best film I have ever seen in my life, I don't think I'll like anything better than this in my entire life in the future."
aggie_knight,"Dec 18, 2003",10/10,"Unlike previous letdowns this year, Return of the King was excellent.  A perfect 10.  Coming in at 3 and a half hours, the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really don't know.  The plot, acting, effects, and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time.  Sean Astin deserve atleast a nod, if the statue as Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Elijah Wood could recieve a nod for Best Actor.  This movie will definately win Best Effects, Best Musical Score, and could win Best Movie this year at the Oscars.  It was that good.  You should go see it, right now.  Stop staring at the computer screen and go.  This movie is that good."
zerophysics,"Jun 18, 2005",10/10,"The one thing Jackson did here that was a HUGE move away from the norm ... notice that none of these DVD's have any trailers for other movies in the beginning of the DVD or any other BS that you have to go through before getting to the actual menu - these three are the only ones out of 200+ DVD's that I own that I can just put in the DVD player and actually be able to watch them without a 5 minute BS runaround of having to try to fast forward through all of the ads and trailers - most of the DVD's out won't even let you access the menu until you watch these forced advertisements ..... I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them"
rbueing,"Feb 22, 2004",9/10,"The high rating of this movie baffles me. While it had superb special effects and above average acting, it failed miserably in telling the story. I was extremely disappointed. I adored the first film in the trilogy, understanding that you cannot include everything in a movie that is in a book. The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance."
neonwolf,"Dec 16, 2003",10/10,"Peter Jackson and Wingnut films have created what may very well be the best movie trilogy in history. And, having just seen all three movies in a row at a marathon showing, I find it safe to say that The Return of the King is the very best of the lot. It goes all out on the technical level, outclassing just about everything else out there, but it also showcases Jackson's talent as a filmmaker. The final chapter of The Lord of the Rings is tightly cut, stunningly beautiful, well acted, and captures the essence of the book it's based on so brilliantly, it's uncanny. I say this both as a film student and a literature student.However, if you find this movie to be seriously flawed, you have a problem with Tolkien's source text, and not with Jackson's adaptation of it. This is perfectly reasonable; after all, high fantasy is not everyone's cup of tea, even though everybody seems to like these movies, or pretend that they do, because that's what you're supposed to these days. I say it's a matter of taste, but I really doubt there will be many that dislike this extremely impressive film.Purists will notice a lot of changes in the storyline, just like with the two previous chapters, and find this somewhat annoying. I felt like that with the first movie, but then I realized that these changes are implemented purely for cinematic reasons. After all, if what we wanted was a perfect rendition of the trilogy in every little detail, why not just read the books instead? Some things just don't work on film, and we're lucky that Peter Jackson knows this very, very well. I also like the way he dares to add extra bits not present in the books.If you still think that the movie is missing some parts along the way, well, you will most likely find them present in the forthcoming Extended Edition. That, however, does not mean you should not see the current version. It feels very much complete as it is. I give it my highest acclaim."
UACW,"Jan 12, 2006",N/A,"It's fantastic that someone finally succeeded in bring Tolkien to the big screen like this, and it took fantastic planning, and Jackson is deserving of every award he's received - and he should have received more.But there comes a time when CGI gets so close to but yet so far from reality that everything looks like a cartoon animated by van Gogh. I think these movies go too far without having much of a choice.The first part was enthralling because it was finally happening, and the Ringwraith were fantastic. The second part surprised by the emotion it invoked - it had all the flurry of a Lucas attempt at an epic but it had guts and grit too. And Jackson made his cast look earthy and human, and he introduced hormones into things that seem absent in the book(s).And it's a fantastic conclusion to be sure, but as with Titanic, the achievement is first and foremost that it happened and that it was a success. There is no way Jackson can get enough acclaim or recognition for what he has done.All I've got to say is I don't especially appreciate all these special effects. They come closer and closer to looking real but they will never be convincing. Serkis is amazing of course, and he should have received some sort of award. But there comes a time when the fantasy of the mind is better than trying to paint the impossible on screen.A lot of people will laud the movie because the effects were so good; this doesn't have squat to do with the quality of the movie. Like saying James Bond's Aston Martin is cool, therefore Connery/Lazenby/Moore/Dalton/Brosnan are good actors.No one can take away from Jackson what he did: a major achievement, a milestone in cinematic and cultural history. But I wasn't overly impressed, and in fact found myself looking at my watch wondering when it would all finally be over. Maybe I was satisfied the movie had made it and lost interest because I already knew the ending; maybe it was the plethora of CGI wizardry that had me longing for Wiley Coyote and his Roadrunner friend.At least there no one's trying to fool you into thinking it's real."
the-pond,"Dec 18, 2003",6/10,"This film was so chalk full of cheesy one liner's that one wondered what happened to the script writers.Gandalf the wizard was reduced to a swordwieilding soldier who merely clubs over the head those who disagree with him.What is clear is that Jackson, Boyens, and Walsh do not have a firm grasp of the source text.One can discern script weaknesses clearly as confused actors muddle through dialogue that they know is suspect at best (see Mortensen's (aragorn) speech at the crowning of the king).I laughed and I cried, but for all the wrong reasons.Rest in peace professor Tolkien, however difficult that may now seem to be."
Craiiiigdavid,"Dec 22, 2003",1/10,"This was the dullest film of the 65 films I have seen all year.It took an age to get going. After 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out, the rest were asleep. I personally demanded and got my money back. If people develop DVT through sitting through this then Peter Jackson should watch out.What happened in the Gollum effects department between Two Towers and this entry? For the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty. Dreadful effects.I also find the actors in these Lord of the Rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic. In the end I was willing Frodo to die because I got fed up of his constant whining. Peter Jackson made a BIG mistake dropping Christopher Lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them, and was sorely missed.Lord of the Rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original Star Wars Trilogy, simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorable."
mrbskywalker,"Mar 10, 2015",10/10,"Probably the best movie in the series The hobbit and LOTR this movie is the best because of three crucial parts.First the Stunning CGI only a genius like Peter Jackson could create along with Weta Workshop.The CGI will make you feel like the orcs are standing right in front of you.Second up on the list is amazing writing.With dialog that makes it seem like real life instead of a movie,with most of the dialog coming from the books too.The finally thing that makes this movie great is the soundtrack.Often Put down as one of the best soundtracks ever,the sad violin theme for rohan, the iconic gondorian theme and even the Mordor theme are good.And you can't deny it you probably cried towards the end of the movie.Yes maybe the ending is a little over the top and gimli really isn't that cool and serves as comic relief but otherwise this movie is flawless."

kolestutzman,"Jul 17, 2020",10/10,Best film in the lord of the rings series. This film in my opinion is the greatest movie of all time.

wwe7961,"Aug 3, 2010",10/10,"Now here we are with the big one. The film that is often called the best film of the decade. The gigantic mass of epic known as The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Everyone looks at this film as the best. In fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including best picture, and won every Oscar it was nominated for. It was a huge success, and yes this film is fantastic. It is one of the biggest adventures I have ever seen. Everything that was great in the first two are great here also. The writing, visuals, acting are all top notch stuff. So is it the best in the trilogy? Well I consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. If any one of them didn't exist the others wouldn't be as good. All of them standing together give us a complete, and epic adventure.4 stars out of 4"
ElvisDeSalvo,"Dec 1, 2024",9/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is an extraordinary conclusion to a legendary trilogy. The film beautifully wraps up the intricate storylines with breathtaking visuals, powerful performances, and a deeply emotional score. Each character's journey is handled with care and respect, making their struggles and triumphs resonate deeply. The themes of friendship, sacrifice, and perseverance shine through, and the final battle scenes are truly epic. It's a film that not only satisfies but leaves a lasting impact, making it a perfect end to one of the greatest fantasy sagas of all time."
feisty_jenn,"Dec 30, 2003",N/A,"It seems clear to me that Jackson has somehow confused ""panoramic"" with ""epic"" and therefore spends most of his time panning across vast vistas and/or showering us with spiralling aerial overviews.  Sadly, in the midst of all this photography, he neglects to actually tell a damn story!I wish film-makers could/would learn that CGA isn't film-making -- there is roughly 3x the CGA in this film that there was in the original (or so i understand) and seemingly correspondingly it is 3x less well realized, narratively complex, weakened character development etc.IMO easily the weakest of the three films..."
beerwine900,"Sep 29, 2007",7/10,"Now i will say without a doubt Return of the King is the best in the trilogy.The Lord of the rings trilogy has everything, action, romance, story, amazing CGI and good performances from all the cast. Unfortunately it is very slow at some parts of the movie and having read the books myself i can tell you there are huge plot holes in the story and much of it was actually changed to fit into the movie.This movie was pretty boring at some parts and a couple of my friends did fall asleep all the way up to the final 20 minutes of fight scene, one of them actually left , and i have to admit at some points i did start to nodd off.I didn't really like the character of legolas in all three movies due to fact that he was to invincible and he didn't even get dirty while fighting orcs and other demon type creatures, however the other cast and characters were done well.I think with the whole trilogy overall you ether love them or fall asleep through half of it, but they are good movies.personally though when it comes to fiction i'd rather watch Blade or Total Recall.7 out of 10."
master5000,"Nov 14, 2004",1/10,"The expectations that were built up by the first film, and the second (allthough slowed down), really plunged down into the lava of Mnt Doom with this one. It really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film (I'm not talking about the extended version, that one is a lot better - but still far from perfect) and how everything could have been.Where should I start?...... It's overly sentimental. I mean really. And I like that s*** usually - I'm a sentimental guy. But here it's really out of proportion, and out of timing. Oh, it's really sad when Faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning, while Pippin is singing som silly song like he's castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that. Bu-hu, this is a mythological-style heroic fantasy-tale, not... Titanic! Everybody are so overly emotional. And I don't even wanna talk about Sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in, with the hand on the chest, looking out over the horizon, with the orchestra at full volume (the only thing missing is the American flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him), and Frodo and his constant twisting-your-head-like-a-puppy-and-looking-with-big-eyes-and-a-""OH-I-love-you-so-much""-smile at Sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going... OK I'm getting carried away....I liked Braveheart for example, even though it has some major flaws. And people think THAT one is overly sentimental. But that one is at least down to earth-sentimental. RotK is up in the sky, almost gone out to space, like (I thought I'd never say this, but), it seems they (producers, crew and actors) really take the film TOO serious. Really. It's a Saga! Not true. It's a 20th-century, made up mythology-history about an IMAGINARY land. It's NOT a record of the Holocaust for Christ's sake!...I understand how they needed to cut some scenes, to save up time. but, well... First of all, they didn't succeed enough with that, the films are 2-3h long and still it feels you're rushing from one place to the next, like you're on a Middleearth-8hour-safari or... cinematic tourbus. Maybe they should've cut it even more, so we could at least get the feel of BEING someplace and not just passing by? But what's really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that don't even belong in the story! Completely made up-scenes, for no logical reason!*The ugly made-up bull/rhinoceros-beasts pulling orc-wagons (whatta F--- is up with that? I don't even know if George Lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the Star Wars universe!)... *The really AWFUL orc liutenant/chief-guy, who's by the way made up out of thin air, who doesn't even look like an orc but more like the aliens from Peter Jackson's early lowbudget cult-films (Mr. Jackson, this is NOT the time and place to have cameos, or draw funny parallells to your Bad Taste-films, that's really... bad taste... disrespectful to the Tolkien-fans)... *The Mûmaks are really cool, but really too big, I mean, they're not dinosaurs-beasts - hey're just big elephants! *All the small details, costumes and armour etc. are really beautiful, really more than you could ever ask for. But the White Dwarf-miniature-esthetics of Minas Tirith is really bad, cause it gives a whole synthetic-comic-book/computer-game-look to Middleearth. Where are the beautiful, classical and authentic designs of Edoras and Rivendell? And no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses! That too is just corny and childish like in computergames. All this, and the excessive use and naive belief in CGI-technology, turns the Battle of Pelenoor Fields, which should be the total culmination and action-peak of the film into a foney uninteresting StarWars/Warhammer40000-mess, it's nothing compared to the battle of helm's deep - and that's not right.And this CGI-trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film-business. It's really sad, these films will be outdated in 10 years. But maybe that's a good thing?RotK isn't the worst of the three, technically. But with the expectations you have from the first two, the books (if you know what's gonna happen), the demands should be pretty high; and, in my opinion too, especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill (just like the matrix), this is the film that disappoints the most. RotK is the greatest and heaviest of the films, the first two would completely crumble under it's weight if it didn't hold, but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it could've, and that is what it should have. Anything else is unacceptable to me, and this is also why I hate it. Cause it really doesn't live up to it's potential, it doesn't even outdo the 2towers and it doesn't live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film.I can't understand how a New Zeelander, who used to make underground films could turn this old British tale into shimmering Hollywood-cheese. It's too pretty, too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust.It's like food, add too many ingredients and spices and they'll take out each other and the dish'll just taste bland... It's just too much of everything, and the whole film falls flat. It's still stunning, but rather tasteless, and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing.I still wanna congratulate P.Jackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home. Thank him, even if he's made me more irritated than delighted, cuz I'm still glad that I'm able to watch these films. He didn't deserve all those Oscars, but he definitely deserved a few, maybe not for directing, but for Best Film - for the production. But this film should NOT be ranked as the best fantasy-film of all time! /Sebastian"
caleb-schrader,"Jul 24, 2019",10/10,What's there to say?! This trilogy is the last and greatest book to movie trilogy ever made. Hands down spectacular.Please don't waste your time on the regular version... extended or nothing!
shontos,"Apr 23, 2021",10/10,"It is one of the Trilogy Masterpiece. I have watch this movie more then 5 times and still, it is so much entertaining. This movie never gets old."
connor_applegate,"Nov 13, 2013",10/10,"I still remember the first time that I watched this movie. I expected going into watching the LOTR trilogy for some kind of nerd fest full of terrible acting and cringe inducing action scenes. Instead what I got was probably my favorite film trilogy of all time. Everything truly spoke to me. Every part of these movies I have loved and always love. The final movie in the trilogy the Return of the King is my personal favorite out of the three. The awe inspiring action scenes, wonderful effects, and the touching themes that can be found in this classic tale. This is definitely a film worth watching again and again and again. It is one of those great movies that will stand the test of time and will never get too old to watch."
Zare_Ali,"Feb 5, 2025",10/10,"Dear Peter Jackson, thank you very much for making Lord of the Rings movie in the best possible way.I have seen and praised this movie many times since 2001 until today.I hope more movies will be released by you in the future.No one could have illustrated Tolkien's book so beautifully.Please, anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, watch it quickly and enjoy it.The Lord of the Rings movie is one of the best fantasy movies in the world and the best choice of actors for this movie has been announcedAnd the special effects for that year are unique All groups in this movie do their job in the best possible way."
carmelolia,"Mar 7, 2025",10/10,"There are so many reviews and critical analysis already written about Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's epic literary masterpiece that adding my own feels almost redundant.However, I want to contribute my own few words of appreciation. Because how couldn't I? Jackson's trilogy has left such a marked impression on my life, such a lasting influence, that I am still obsessed to this day after the first time I have watched it at the cinema with my family more than two decades ago. The Tolkien purist might argue there are certain mistakes. But there is no arguing against the sheer quality, the sheer magnitude of the jaw-droppingly awesome cinematic and epic mastery of this trilogy, of which 'The Return of the King' is no exception to.The winner of a whopping eleven Oscars, 'The Return of the King' does not need any more elaborated critical appreciation, especially from my part. But since this is a film which I have rewatched countless times (I remember renting it many times from the DVD rental store before actually buying my own copy because I thought I would go bankrupt!), I wanted to add at least these few words of appreciation to Mr Peter Jackson and all the actors and actresses, crew, and production team involved in creating this gem.Thank you for creating one of the best and most influential films I have ever watched in my life."
Mediatation,"Jun 4, 2025",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is the grand conclusion to Peter Jackson's ambitious adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy epic, solidifying the series as one of cinema's greatest trilogies of all time. Between the high-stakes action sequences and the emotional payoff of the ending, this final film serves as a bountiful reward for viewers who have completed an incredible journey.Viggo Mortensen's fairy-tale prince appearance and timeless performance style have consistently given Aragorn the regal presence the character deserves. The trilogy as a whole lives up to the lofty expectations of the legendary source material, and ""The Return of the King"" proves that the risk on such a large-scale project was worthwhile."
acmulvey,"Jul 23, 2019",10/10,Tolkien's work was masterfully put into film by Peter Jackson who has created something perfect.
evanewport,"Mar 14, 2025",10/10,"This is an absolute masterpiece of a film, i love the LoTR trilogy, its so incredible and one of my three comfort films (bet you can't guess the other ones lol) These films make me so happy and they create such an atmosphere when watching them, i highly reccomend these LoTR films for people who want a family film night, i don't recommend for anyone under 8 as it is a wee bit violent but i still recommend it. LoTR has some of the most incredible characters and the way the music is it really convays all of the emotions in the scenes, Howard Leslie Shore did an incredible job with the music. Anway i highly recommend the trilogy."
s4010284,"Jun 9, 2004",N/A,"Well, after 3 years of waiting from the first time we see FOTR to the so-called ""epic"" conclusion of the lord of the rings, I have to say I was expecting more. Storywise I believe that several essential elements were left out ie. Saruman's appearance in the Shire. In its stead were non essential, showy special effect scenes which added little to no substance to an already way too long movie. I had an extreme case of the fidgets by the time the 5th ending finally ended the film for good.That being said I do think that the battle scenes were absolutely fantastic and Jackson had captured the emotional undertone of Tolkeins work superbly so I definitely don't blame hard-core fans for enjoying it so much! On that note, I must add that I believe it to be extremely poor taste to personally criticize and attack others whose views differ from one's own. Lets remember its only a movie, and not worth being cruel and judgemental towards others over!"
Egahd,"Mar 7, 2004",6/10,"Yes, it's battle scenes were second to none. But battles are not all the stuff of great epics. The fact that none of its actors were nominated says alot. I feel in time the recollections of this film will be revalued to nothing more than a good movie.The edit of this film was criminally long. At 3 1/2 hours without intermission it felt like six. The ending upon ending was one weepy hobbit scene after another - emotionally redundant.I feel that two phenomenoms in hype are at play. First , it was released at a time when most epic adventures are directed without the wit, sensitivity and storyline Jackson has. Two, after investing all day into a movie, if it's good you liable to say it's great, especially after recovering from severe butt cramp.When the hype dies and people look at the film again, they'll see it for what it is. A good film with great battles and mediocre to in some cases below the line performances. Elijah Woods shades of torment read as the same response except at different volumes. While diffusion, a good sound mix save Liv Tyler from utter ridicule as she gives us her unequaled rendition of the gaumless pout.It is her stoyline I find the most distracting. Her lack of craft amidst a well trained cast, cheapens the overall perfomances. Her attempts to looks deep are as vain attempt to show life behind her eyes as her Oscar Night spectacles. Thank God she wasn't in a scene with Cate Blanchett. The contrast would reveal the babe casting truth. Was this an appeal to Frat boys far and wide. Surely they could've found a comely brunette with chops.In the end, the endless moaning and weeping of Hobbits, especially in the last reel, will be viewed for the sentimental drivel it really is.Had they cut down on this along with Liv Tyler's distraction, the film could have been a tight 2 1/2 hours with far more resonance.And on a philosophical note, are we too take the somewhat physically and sometimes mentally feeble Hobbits seriously as heroes. Their inumerable flaws often stretch the line of credibility. In this orc eat orc world of Middle Earth how they survived at all is a fantasy unto itself.On the good side, for a third installment it didn't fall into the entertainment abyss of the Matrix.In all 6 of 10 Egahd."
jupiter2-6,"Jun 7, 2004",1/10,"There's nothing deep or important going on here, so  a critique of this film is almost unnecessary. What passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced, loud, stunning ""Imax"" experiment in eye-candy that masks, once again, a slowly moving, thin story line. Obviously, the members of SAG have dispensed with background checks on film editors. There's enough slow-motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice. Many people will be amazed by the neverending, in-your-face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also, you'd better search elsewhere. It's like trying to read the Latin version of ""War And Peace"" while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender. And if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasn't enough, just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine-glazed, overlit endings. And there are at least 5 of them. For a while, I was expectin Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost to show up and smile goodbye. And Cate Blanchett never looked so vapid. It's brass, tacky, loud, long, obvious schlock and thus hugely popular. Beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example. Giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold-plating."
