kbowes-23399,"Sep 23, 2018",8/10,"A very cinematically beautiful film with characters you just fall in love with. I won't lie, the plot is very hard to follow. If you've read the book, you can tell that miyazaki focused less on following the plot, more on making the film beautiful to watch, and as a result we are left with a story that has huge chunks missing and frankly doesn't make a lot of sense in places. But I'm not mad, because it is very, very beautiful to watch."
whitetigah,"Sep 6, 2004",9/10,"(first of all: sorry if my English is not the best out there, but it's not my native language)I was lucky enough to see the world premiere (at Venice Film Festival, September 5, 2004).Not only the art and animation is breathtaking (with almost no CGI), but the story is also above Miyazaki standards.The characters are wonderful, each one with his (or her) own personality. Among them the best is for sure Calcifer, the Fire Demon, who is actually an almost all-powerful being, but is often underestimated by the other characters (""If you don't obey, I'll pour water on you!"").The music is one of the best parts of the movie. Even if you don't notice it, it is always there, always conveying the right feeling.Bottom line: this is an excellent movie. If you liked other movies by Miyazaki (such as Mononoke Hime, Spirited Away, Laputa Castle in the Sky...) you cannot miss it."
surenm,"Mar 20, 2005",10/10,"I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.Also, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream."
soanim8ed,"Jun 6, 2005",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).While not as awe-inspiring as Spirited Away or action-packed as Mononoke, it does work on the level of Kiki's Delivery Service as a girl is forced to be better than she thinks she can be (well, that's not a big surprise, that's all his films). And as with all Miyazaki stories, the story teaches without being preachy. And the lessons learned are represented in character changes and in the character's physical appearance as well. It's that same attention to detail that has made Pixar so great.The animation is wonderful. The castle is itself is a mesh-mash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works. Through magic, of course. The magic being Howl's and the authoritative hand of Miyazaki's direction. The airships (wow, airships in a Miyazaki film? Who would have thunk?) are great variations of one's he's used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at war.Most of the voice work was very strong including Christian Bale (Howl) and Emily Mortimer (as the young version of the heroine, Sophie). The voice that surprised me was Billy Crystal as Calcifer, the little flame that could. He's the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable character.There a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points weren't very strong, but overall it's another outstanding film from Studio Ghibli. Even my 40 year old partner, who had spent the day mountain biking, was dead tired and had never seen a Miyazaki film stayed awake for the entire 2 hours. When we left at 3:30 in the morning still jabbering away about all the imagery and meaning, we realized we had seen true art."
cornishogre-1,"Jul 10, 2005",10/10,"When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl's Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.I'd never heard of Miyazaki. Then I saw Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Wow. I think Ms Jones and Mr. Miyazaki must be kindred souls. His movies share a lot with her novels  a whimsical sense of humor, impossible to pigeonhole into a category, magic and mischief, and a firm respect for the audience's intelligence. I began to pace the floor in anticipation of the movie.I saw the movie today. I was not disappointed. The soul of the story is intact, Sophie and Howl and Calcifer are nearly as I imagined them. Yes, there are some plot adjustments. Think of it as the Series 12C version (for those who have read Ms Jones' Chrestomanci books.) The main elements are there, some re-arranged, some changed, yet with a full understanding of the original. Much like the 2004 version of Peter Pan  much was changed, but the soul is the same.For those who wonder, here are the differences between the movie and the novel. I've tried to phrase them carefully to avoid spoilers for either fans of Ms Jones's work who have yet to see the movie, and those who have seen the movie and have yet to read the book: Why the witch bespells Sophie Where the door opens when the dial points to blackSophie's sister Martha, and the plot line involving sister Lettie are not in the movie  Mrs. Pentstemmon, Miss Angorian, Mrs. Fairfax are also missing, but elements of each are woven into other characters in the movie  Michael (Markl) is a different age  The battles  magical and military  are quite different (but equally spectacular)  The dog appears at a different time, with a different, yet just as mysterious, agenda  The scarecrow's relationship with Sophie is different  Thelevel of technology is different. (I did miss the 7-league boots)My advice: go see the movie. It's magical and beautiful and funny. Then, if you are a Diana Wynne Jones fan, check out the rest of Miyazaki's films. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. If you are a Miyazaki fan, hie thee to a library or bookstore try Ms Jones' books. (There is a sequel to Howl's Moving Castle  Castle in the Air.)And enjoy!"
WritelySo,"Feb 23, 2005",10/10,"What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki's work, but in Howl's Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.It has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.He achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.The story is fantastic - I haven't read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki's work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.I can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!"
Andrea_R,"Oct 1, 2004",10/10,"I Don't get words to express what I felt when coming out of the cinema, Howl's Moving Castle is an absolutely fantastic film and has even out Laputa and Totoro as my favourite Miyazaki film.The story is amazing and the characters and creatures are as excellently crafted and fun to watch as ever. The voice actors and music are perfect Joe Hisaishi in my opinion is the best contemporary composer.My only criticism (very little) is maybe the ending (last minutes) that rises suddenly, far from the habitual perfection of the catharsis final of the Miyazaki's films but nothing importantThe movie has a really bad thing of the film: THE LONG WAITING TO SEE IT AGAIN!ESSENTIAL"
jessup-86446,"Jun 25, 2020",6/10,"Maybe the only way to enjoy this movie is to think of it more as a visual symphony than a cohesive narrative? Like fantasia or something?
I had soooo many questions I needed answers for, and while I got some of them from the ending, for the most part I'm just left scratching my head and wondering what the heck I just watched.
Seriously, not even plot holes, just missing pieces of plot; so much information is never given and its absence is felt.
Is the war somehow Howl's fault? Where the heck did Sophie's mom come from?
Who was the witch? Who was the other witch? Is Sophie a witch? Why did the first witch curse Sophie? Why was the second witch so mad? Was she mad or am I projecting? On and on it goes.
Sigh.
6/10 Stars. All in all I think that it's a very pretty movie, with decent animation, but there are better Ghibli films for both animation and story."
chiarasf,"Sep 14, 2004",9/10,"In a time of war and falsity here it is a dancing poetry from Japan against all the cruelty and pain. The moving castle leads us to a magic place where life has a strong value and elderly people have an important role to play. Also in an apparent hostility or in a scarecrow, Hayao Miyazaki gives us the chance of finding a friend and not letting the dream go down. The perfect technique and the emotional stream are in complete harmony. If the jury of the Venice Film Festival had been more far-seeing, it would have given a more prestigious prize to this masterpiece."
robertrutledge,"Sep 4, 2021",6/10,"I tried liking this movie. I don't get what all the hype is about. It is very hard to follow. Basically, this old witch turns this little girl who works at a hat shop into an old woman. The girl doesn't mind too much, because she's always been sort of an ""old soul"" anyways. She runs away from home because she doesn't want anyone seeing her as an old woman. She then runs into this random-ass scarecrow. Finally, she comes across the titular moving castle, although at this point in the story she has already had a run-in with the owner, Howl.The moving castle is so confusing. There are so many weird and awkward aspects of it, such as a spinning color wheel by the door. I respect the creative animation, but it just doesn't spark my imagination the way that other films by Miyazaki do. Halfway through the movie, the old witch who turns the protagonist into an old woman suddenly becomes one of the ""good guys"" for no apparent reason. Howl is supposed to be mysterious and heroic, but he comes off more as arrogant and annoying. He is overall not a very likable character. He's a cliché animé pretty boy.I understand that this movie is a criticism of war. I can respect that. But it's just kind of all over the place. There is no real continuity. Maybe I'm too dumb to grasp how good it really is. I'll give it another shot, but I must say, I was a little underwhelmed and very confused by this movie."
planktonrules,"Jun 11, 2007",8/10,"I went to see this film with my anime and Diana Wynne Jones-loving teenage daughter. And while I enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation, story and overall sense of fun, it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it! It was as if we saw two entirely different films. Why? Well, she is a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan and has read and re-read just about everything she ever wrote. And, according to her, the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director Miyazaki. However, my advice is DON'T read the book and just go and see the movie. Then, after enjoying it, read the book ONLY if you are 100% sure you can do this without freaking out because they are so different!! I didn't know the difference and had a great time seeing the film!"
deegola,"Feb 23, 2005",8/10,"It's hard to make any movie that follow after 'Spirited Away' So, when you watch, you have to try and keep an open mind....which is hard to do since the characters, and the whole feel of the film seems so much like his previous works.But what fun this film is! And interestingly beautiful. I could watch most any of his movies, just to look at the beautiful scenery. I love some of the incredible imagination that goes into his works.I could easily recommend this film. No, it's not the better than the rest, but I feel it's definitely worth your time.I look forward to seeing the film again, maybe I will understand some things a bit better."
auuwws,"Feb 25, 2021",9/10,"The most beautiful anime film I have ever seen, Studio Ghibli proved to me that it is the undisputed best anime studio, the story of the film was very beautiful and the projections of the film were excellent, the characters of the film were beautifully written, especially the character of Hauru, it started narcissistic and ended completely differently, I liked the romantic relationship between Sophie and Hauru were awesome, and the film ending was so beautiful, I highly recommend watching it"
ngchiho,"Jul 30, 2005",10/10,"Since 1984, that 20 years ago, I have watch every movie Miyazaki make and mostly on cinema. Howl's is a long wait for me since the Spirit Away. After I seen this movie, it is still very enjoyable to me but there is something in my mind still questioning. Miyazaki want to tell us a love story, that we are sure but may be there is some more. After i read a local film review, the question is entirely clear now I seen this movie into another perspective.Yea, Sofi is the main character and the story are spin around her adventure. However, Miyazaki seem want to look into the aspects of modern Japanese man through Sofi view point. Howl is a powerful wizard; however his life is not as happy as other thinks. Every success had a price. He was chased by 2 waring parties who want to own his power, he living in a mess inside a moving castle which was keep hiding from one place to another place. Only thing that keep him going is his great style of hair and the believe that he is looking handsome. That why Miyazaki choose Takuya Kimura as Howl casting, in fact, Kimura is a top idol star in Japan which is share a similar burden as Howl, he is handsome, he is popular but he is not free, all the decisions are subject to his manager company, he could not date a girl openly. Yet Kimura married Kudo Shizuka despite all the opposition from his manager company. That strike the similarity that love shall triumph all. Even the war could be stop and the teacher of Howl would not stop him at the end."
TheLittleSongbird,"Apr 3, 2010",9/10,"I love anime, and when I noticed that Howl's Moving Castle was showing today, I knew I had to see it. And you know what, I wasn't disappointed. I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
jotix100,"Jul 2, 2005",10/10,"The genius of Anime films, Hayao Miyazaki, shows why he is one of an absolute masters of the genre. Taking Diana Wynne Jones' story ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and creating the magnificent film for our delight, is something that no other man could have accomplished with as much flair and panache as Mr. Miyazaki has done.The film has such a great look that at times we wonder if one is really seeing an animated film, or not. The images we watch on the screen have such detailed and rich look that we wonder how did Mr. Miyasaki could have accomplished it.Not having seen the Japanese version, the English one that was released here offers great voices to go along with the many characters in the film. The big surprise was Jean Simmons, an actress we haven't see much lately who does a great job with the older Sophie. As the young Sophie, Emily Mortimes is wonderful and her voice suits the character so well. It was also a stroke of genius to have cast Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, as she seems to be having a great time acting her. Billy Crystal was delightful as Calcifer and Josh Hutcherson is perfect as Markl. Christian Bale is an amazing Howl. In minor roles we hear the voices of Blythe Danner, Crisping Freeman and Jena Malone, among others.This Anime film will delight young and old fans of Hayao Miyazaki who can look forward to a great time at the movies with this film."
life_on_screen,"Jan 12, 2005",7/10,"""Howl's Moving Castle"" opened here in France on Jan. 12th (as ""Le Château Ambulant,"" natch), and I saw it at an avant-première. As a raving fan of Miyazaki and of Diana Wynne Jones, I feel lucky to be an American living in France -- I see there's no release date announced yet for the U.S. Sorry, folks, and blame Disney!I understand the feelings of viewers who have criticized the movie as trite. I find it's less imaginative, in terms of character development and emotional profundity, than Miyazaki's best masterpieces. However, even a pedestrian Miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich, frightening, imaginative and humane than any six Disney films put together, and there's a lot to love in ""Howl's Moving Castle.""I am glad I didn't reread Jones' book before seeing the film; even going on my six-year-old memory of the novel, I can see the movie's a very loose adaptation, and I think Jones fans would do best to try to take the movie on its own merits instead of looking for a faithful adaptation. That said, Miyazaki is surprisingly successful, at moments, in capturing the richness of the novel's characters: the peculiar co-habitation of charm and terror in Howl the sorcerer and his demon companion Calcifer, and the pragmatic strength of will that makes us love Sophie, the protagonist, who embodies both the fairy-tale archetypes of the young girl and the old woman at once.Miyazaki's directorial trademarks are here in spades. Most of them lend strength and power to the film: his passion for open landscapes, his vision of the power and horror of war, the uncompromised way his movies work to empower children, and especially girls. A few of them are just Miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement (walrus mustaches, cobbled European squares, and flying machines for everyone!) Richer and stranger, though, are the very successful integration of two things that Disney animation never even approaches: the way even a children's story can blur lines between an enemy and a friend, and the cohabitation of the monstrous and the sublime. Enemy, ally, monster, beloved: Miyazaki gives both visual and moral weight to these disturbing contradictions, and certain scenes in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" evoke a frightening sublimity I have never seen elsewhere than in ""Princess Mononoke.""I think the film suffers from a slightly hurried pace, especially with respect to the protagonists' character development, and the result is a loss of the subtlety that makes Jones' book such a gripping fairy tale. Her Howl is more ambivalent, and her story is a more complex investigation of adolescent heartlessness and the growth of the heart. The ending, which falls back too much on clichéd imagery and deus-ex-machina, also could have been better handled. All that said, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" contains lots of treasures and will, I think, stand up to repeated viewings. Miyazaki fans will be delighted, and kids around the world should be given the chance to taste this latest rich, respectful children's tale. (Be warned, though: there are moments as terrifying as those in ""Princess Mononoke,"" and younger kids will need their parents with them.)On a final note, as few hardcore fans of Japanese anime will need to be reminded, the movie is doubtless best seen in its original version with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is terrific -- although the voice of ""young Sophie"" doesn't strike me as anything special, the actors playing the aged Sophie, Howl, and especially Calcifer are fantastic. Calcifer is a magnificent creation and should delight even the most conservative fan of the novel. I have serious doubts that the inevitable English-language dub will do the nuances justice."
JohnDeSando,"Jun 17, 2005",10/10,"Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, ""I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.""The plot is almost inscrutable as it depicts a kind of late nineteenth-century European city in which hat shop girl Sophie alternately is wooed by a cute wizard, Howl, and cursed by a witch to be shifted into an old crone's body. Her Dorothy-like wandering with, among others, a pogo-sticked scarecrow, takes her to the titular castle of Howl, where she cleans, keeps order, and longs for Howl. Ultimately she confronts a sorceress, Madam Suliman. War ensues but can't defeat the power of love.The real strength of Howl's Moving Castle is in character diversity and development with a vain, kind, and immature hero; villains morphing into lovable friends and a fire that talks like Billy Crystal and surpasses Eddie Murphy's wisecracking donkey. These are just some of the touches of this hip Asian anime that comments on the folly of war promoted by very neocon-like leaders and the endlessly interesting conflicts between the good and bad angels of each character. Shape-shifting heroine Sophie says, ""I don't want to live if I can't be beautiful!"" Now there's my kind of self-centered lady, heroic and callow in the same film.No one-dimensional characters for this director, perhaps the most gifted animator in the world."
mahmus,"Jul 27, 2020",6/10,"This is a very good movie, but I have a lot of issues with it.This movie, espcially its messy third act, feels like sensory overload. Everything is happening so fast and so loud and the quiet moments of rest (which are always the best parts of every Ghibli film) are very few and far between compared to other Ghibli films. It feels very rushed and overwhelming and it gives me a headache.Also, the exact nature of Sophie's curse (and the movie's world in general) is never really explained. I like how her age changes, but it would be good to know what exactly triggers those changes. A lot in this film is unexplained and it's very frustrating. This is probably Ghibli's most nonsensical movie.With that said, I do like it. While I think that the second half is kind of a mess, the first half is really good. It's a lot slower and more focused. There are less characters and there's actual moments to rest and contemplate the beautiful scenery. The ending is also really nice.The best things about this movie are the visuals (obviously) and Howl, especially when he's being a total drama queen. I want more dramatic Howl please.Overall, this is far from being one of my favorite Ghibli movies, but I think the good outweighs the bad just enough. I know it's really beloved, but I will still take Spirited Away or Whisper of the Heart over this anytime."
scififan_uk,"Sep 27, 2005",10/10,"First, I must confess that I have never seen Spirited Away so I cannot make any comparisons. Second, I must say this is one of the best films I have ever seen!What made me enjoy the film so much? The imagination, the romance, and the realistic way Sophie is portrayed - her insecurities, how she copes when she is cursed, and how things change physically as she is transformed into an old woman. And then there's the humour - the Witch of the Waste was hilarious! I never thought I could be so taken by a children's film, but I enjoyed the movie so much I went back and saw it 3 more times, which I've never done before.I can highly recommend Howl's Moving Castle."
BriarRos,"Jun 21, 2005",9/10,"I drove for three hours to reach a theater that was playing this film, and it was worth it! The English cast was amazing, and I normally shun all dubbed films. It really seemed like they were the original voices. I never once wished I could hear the Japanese like I usually do, even on Spirited Away. Now that is settled!This film deals mostly with the character of Sophie. I won't sum up the plot, you've seen that already. The heart of the film is at Sophie accepting herself, and accepting the affection of other people. That's pretty much the moral. The most winning character by far is Howl himself, at least for a girl like me. He is a really complex character, beautiful drawn, and voiced with precision by Christian Bale. He sounds really similar to his Batman voice in this, so get ready for that. Billy Crystal's Calcifer is refreshingly muted. I had worried about him being too flamboyant, but he is really a charming character. The entire cast of characters are so real, as is the world they inhabit, that it just draws you in. I smiled through the first half of the movie!I saw the film with friends in their mid-twenties, one of which is not into anime, and we all enjoyed it. Many of the folks at the theatre brought children, but it seemed like the adults enjoyed it far more than the children. It is probably too dark for kids under 8, in my opinion. There is a lot of bombing in the second half, and it can be startling.I all this is a really good film. The plot gets a little complicated in the second half, where it starts to greatly deviate from the book and become more Miyazaki, but there is plenty of action, comedy, romance, and fun to please every age group. I plan on taking my grandma to see it; I think older people would really get a kick out of ""Grandma Sophie."" Best Animated Film of the year, for sure!"
digadigado,"Jul 15, 2005",9/10,"WritelySo's review has said it better than I ever could. So I'll put my two cents worth in anyway.Of the three big name and one independent feature films I've seen in the past six weeks, this is the best. The first thing that catches your eye (ahem!) is Miyazaki's wonderful animation. His scenes are to film what Hal Foster did to the Sunday comics. They are colorful, lifelike, have great attention to detail and are... well, just beautiful.A late 19th European setting done to a fare-thee-well by a Japanese artist? You bet. He did it in Porco Rosso and he's done it at least as well here. That's another recommended Miyazaki masterpiece after this one charms you.I was quickly caught up in the film. The characters are believable and the voices, well it's a shame to call it dubbing. I doubt it was easy to match English dialog to a Japanese film but they did a superb job. What this means to you is that you never, ever notice. The voices are appropriate to the characters and, I think, really enrich the character's personalities.While kids will appreciate the animation and action, Howl's Moving Castle is really for adults. Take your kids to see it. When they see it again in ten years, they'll see an entirely new film all over again.If there's any justice in the Academy Awards, this should get Miyazaki another one - I think it's even better than Spirited Away.When they're worth it (rarely) I pay attention to film scores, and Joe Hisaishi has written one well matched to this fine film.Did I make the point that I LOVED this film? I hope you do too."
chiragrathod09,"Sep 5, 2025",8/10,"Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle, a Studio Ghibli gem, is a breathtaking blend of fantasy, romance, and anti-war sentiment that enchants with its vivid animation and heartfelt storytelling. Based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel, the film follows Sophie, a shy young hat-maker who is cursed by the jealous Witch of the Waste to become an elderly woman. Seeking to break the spell, Sophie finds refuge in the magical, clanking castle of the enigmatic wizard Howl, powered by the fiery demon Calcifer. What unfolds is a dreamlike adventure filled with quirky characters, stunning visuals, and profound themes.The animation is nothing short of breathtaking. The moving castle itself-a whimsical hodgepodge of gears, legs, and chimneys-is a masterpiece of imagination. The landscapes shift between serene countryside, bustling cities, and war-torn skies, all rendered in Miyazaki's distinct watercolor-inspired style.Sophie's journey from self-doubt to confidence, paired with Howl's growth from vanity to courage, anchors the story emotionally, though the romance feels understated compared to the novel's depth.However, some note a convoluted third act, with plot points like Sophie's fluctuating age and abrupt time-travel elements left unexplained, creating a sense of sensory overload. Compared to Miyazaki's Spirited Away, it can feel less cohesive, but its charm and moral complexity-exploring self-acceptance, the futility of war, and the blurred lines between friend and foe-make it unforgettable."

The story is interesting to be sure, but the animation and picturesque scenery add more than enough action and drama to offset traditional venues. Within the film are the talented voices of Jean Simmons and Emily Mortimer as the voice of Sophie, Christian Bale as Howl, the Bird Prince, Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, the Sourceress. Josh Hutcherson as Markl and of course Billy Crystal is terrific as Calcifer, the Fire Demon. This fine cast adds resilience to the inspirational tale as does the colorful and touching film. To anyone who enjoys children's stories which endure the test of time and mesmerize modern audiences, this is one for the complete library. A classic in the making. ****"
SnoopyStyle,"Oct 31, 2016",7/10,"Sophie is a young shy hat maker working for her mother in an alternate-world turn-of-the-century European town. A wizard named Howl rescues her from a couple of lascivious soldiers only to be chased by a horde of waste demons. They escape to her sister Lettie's place. She is later visited by the Witch of the Waste and turned into an old woman. She runs away and encounters scarecrow Turnip-Head. After helping it, it leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. There she encounters the fire demon Calcifer who Howl uses to power the castle. Calcifer offers to break her curse if she could end his servitude. Sophie pretends to be new cleaning lady Grandma Sophie. The Mayor arrives at the Great Wizard Jenkins with a request from the King to fight in the war. Howl's apprentice Markl is able to switch between various exits and with various disguises. Then the other king invites Great Wizard Pendragon to join in the war. Howl is known as both wizards and unwilling to help either side. Madame Suliman threatens to take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart.This is an interesting world. The start sets up an easy fantasy with an evil witch and a haunted hero. The twist is the heroine gets turned into an old hag. About midway, the movie takes an odd turn that deviates from that easy formula. The evil witch becomes powerless. There is a new villain but she's not really a villain. This is an anti-war movie but it isn't so straight forward. Even the simple love story gets a last-minute true love detour. While the world is amazing, the story seems to delight in odd diversions from the formula."
christiam-51976,"Sep 26, 2022",6/10,I really loved the colors and the animation. I could tell that they've spent so much time and effort to show all of these effects on the spells and on the world building. The characters also were pretty unique and were pretty well made. Although i really did not like the plot because hardly anything was explained thoroughly and we got left with filling in the pieces. I feel like the story was all over the place and some things did not really much sense. There were some pretty funny moments and some great music but it was boring and slow towards the second part of the movie. I believe if they made the movie a bit shorter and we learned more about each character it wouldve been at least a 7 or 8.
juska-lampela,"Jan 24, 2005",8/10,"The more you've seen Miyazaki's films, there is a chance you'll less likely enjoy this movie. Why so? Because you can familiarize almost every single element from his previous works in Howl, which is actually quite strange. Before Howl his films were ALWAYS unique and new, when compared with the ones he had made before. But in Howl we can (at least subconsciously) easily compare those black liquid shades chasing Howl to Spirited Away's No-face and the whole ambiance stands somewhere between Kiki and Laputa. Not good.If you take all those before seen Miyazaki trademarks away, the entity of the movie is frankly said quite fragile; Mages used as part of the military machinery. I haven't read the book version of Howl, but for the movie part I can say, that it is a very traditional piece of Ghibli and also has a worn-out story. The original and thus powerful themes we saw in Mononoke and Spirited Away are gone now, and have been replaced with the used ones: war and love. So ""unmiyazakian"".Yet I'm quite sure that I would appreciate Howl a whole lot more, if it was the first Ghibli, and above all the first Miyazaki-manufactured movie I've had ever seen. The technical asset of Howl has been substantially improved and Hisaishi's score is once again a top-notch personal performance. The usage of 3D-imaginery has been increased, but the animation is still 99% hand-made, which I naturally appreciate. The characters have variable personalities and especially Witch of the Waste had something, that this movie truly needed.Maybe Mr. Miyazaki shouldn't have done a book adaptation in the first place, since his purely imaginative mind is meant for bigger things. Instead of ""loaning"" ideas from others, he should be the only source of inspiration, when preparing for his new project. I sure hope that Howl won't be Hayao Miyazaki's final depot in his long career, rather I want to see him leave the ring as a legend instead of a champion.Rating: ***½"
Quinoa1984,"Dec 30, 2006",9/10,"I can't say for certain, especially after only seeing the English-language dub of the film in the theater (and seeing bits of it again on TV)- that Howl's Moving Castle is one of the very best of the great Hayao Miyazaki's feature films. But I didn't leave it feeling un-happy in the slightest, and if anything I remember most the feeling of uplift, which is what the best fairy tales try to accomplish. It follows the strand left by Spirited Away (though also trailing off from other Miyazaki films to be sure) where a female character is the protagonist thrust into strange circumstances, really around a curse.Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer and the great Jean Simmons in the English dub) gets cursed by an evil witch, and then meets up at Howl's castle (Howl, by the way, is a slightly melancholy and quirky wizard, voiced in a fun way by Christian Bale), and sets about to make herself useful, however to also keep order in the guide of her now old-lady persona (and, more importantly, to free herself from the curse). She also has to contend with an overly cautious flame (Billy Crystal, odd choice for a talking fire, but it works better than I expected), and a scarecrow who sometimes just can't sit still.Soon Sophie becomes the unwitting assistant to Howl, as she goes in partial disguise to help him be present instead of him before his former tutor, Madame Suliman. And, of course, in the meantime, a love story unfolds. Although I could argue that Howl's Moving Castle begins to stray a little from the completely satisfying world portrayed in Spirited Away or particularly in Princess Mononoke- and that the story is given way, frustrations and all, for the visual wonderment- it's still a delight from start to finish. While I wondered when I first saw it if the Japanese dialog would make a difference by much, seeing the American voices didn't detract much at all, and if anything the cast fulfills the story more than one could hope for.And, of course, those visual inventions are never to be taken for granted in Miyazaki's world (more than likely attributable to the source from Diana Wynne Jones and leaning more to Western influence then the decidedly awesomely Eastern Mononoke). If anything individual moments, like when Howl almost melts away from not having certain powers, is really intriguing, or in just seeing the castle itself, with all of the little parts and spindles a marvel in and of itself (Ebert's not far off from saying that it's one of the great unique places of the movies, and for me almost resides on the other industrial side of the cutesy wonderment of Totoro).I definitely need to watch it again, as Miyazaki's worlds usually do, but for now I do recommend it, even if you've never seen one of his films. Little girls too, I'd imagine, might get an extra kick out of the strong-willed female lead and the strong romantic interests in the storyline (and having a handsome leading man voiced by Bale doesn't hurt either)."
foxly-1,"Aug 22, 2005",10/10,"What can I say? Howl is a beautiful, gentle person. The character movement is as magical as the storyline. Miyazaki's finest. I'll be buying it on DVD. Seen it five times in Japanese. Will be watching in English in theatre as well. Just wish the DVD would be released sooner than Spring 2006 :(I identify with Sophie, she has a good heart and is beautiful, but doesn't know it. A selfless character anyone could appreciate.Loved the ""villains"" and the curses were so creative, so enriching for a fantastic setting, storyline, and those characters!Calcifur is lovable. Still curious about where Howl's apprentice came from and his story. The setting is marvellous.I share the sentiments about war expressed by the main characters.Exciting, romantic, pure enjoyment. It will leave you feeling satisfied as though you'd just been on an adventure of your own and it had an ending that made you feel complete. You can't help but truly feel for the characters. :-) Turnip Head was such a great idea. Oz has nothing on that guy. The castle will blow your mind. The character animation is enthralling, the backgrounds are idyllic. Excellent humanistic storyline! Every writer/director has something to learn from Hayao Miyazaki. If I could e-mail him I would praise him and tell him how his stories always have touched my heart.All in all, Howl could steal my heart any day. I will watch it again and again.Quote: ""I'm hopeless. I'm not handsome anymore. I want to die."""
Eddieh1979-1,"Aug 21, 2005",10/10,"Everything was great about this movie. Easy to love characters, great storyline, extremely creative ideas, brilliant artwork and design...you name it, this movie has it. This movie will be inspiring anyone who watches it. Christian Bale and Billy Crystal fit the parts perfectly and it's great to watch a movie that doesn't have overly popular voice actors like ""John Goodman"" or ""Robin Williams"". This movie appeals to kids as well as adults. I took my 3 year old daughter to see it and she was completely drawn into it. This movie has an intelligent sense of humor that makes you honestly want to laugh, and not some shallow ""slapstick"" humor. There is plenty of action and drama to be found as well. You will have your emotions going all over the place while watching this. At first I was skeptical about the idea of a ""moving castle"" as the title implies, but once you watch it, things will make sense and you wouldn't want the plot to be any other way. The directing/writing of this movie makes Tim Burton look like an amateur. Go see it! And if you can't find a theater nearby...then sorry about your luck! Write an angry letter to Disney or request it at your movie theater."
Scarlet_Onyx,"Jun 16, 2005",10/10,"I saw the commercial for the movie a few days before the premiere and it just grabbed me - I had to go see it. Howl's Moving Castle is pure magic.First, it has an entertaining and charming storyline, but not something that I would consider deep. That's okay though because I didn't go in expecting to find a profound message hidden in there somewhere. There's plenty of humor, including commentary on old age that even my mother chuckled at. Secondly, the animation is amazing. The settings, the people, the vehicles - all are detailed and interesting. I'm told there is 3-D sneaked into it as well and I didn't see anything painfully obvious so bravo on incorporating it successfully.I said it makes me feel like a kid because it didn't rely on logic. I mean, it has a castle that walks on little stick legs and looks like a pile of junk held together with who-knows-what. But the sheer weirdness of it fit the movie. I didn't once sit there and try to puzzle out how it could move - I accepted its ability to walk. I think we too often expect something as illogical as magic to work by rules.Not that there weren't things that couldn't be improved upon. The characters were a bit flat: they didn't really develop a great deal as time went on, but again this wasn't a deep movie. Bale's voice for Howl might not have been the best choice as it sounded a bit too deep and forceful for the slender wizard. The rest of the character voices were more or less fine. Jean Simmons did a great job and Billy Crystal's always good with the funny lines. The ending was a bit rushed as if they realized they only had a couple of minutes to wrap things up so a few things happened so quickly that they seemed more like an afterthought.All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I was really happy to see it and come out with the feeling that magic still does exist somewhere out there."
WizardX,"Jan 18, 2005",7/10,"I'm a big fan of Miyazaki's work, and having seen everything else he's done, I had to see Howl as soon as I could locate a subtitled version. Unfortunately, I must rank it among his weaker efforts. It's certainly not a BAD film - I don't think the man is capable of that - but after the brilliance of Mononoke, and Spirited Away, I was disappointed.The big problem, putting it bluntly, is that the movie makes no sense. It's possible the fansub I was watching mangled it, but I can't imagine a way for the script to be written to make the events cohesive. It takes the dream-logic of Spirited Away, but takes it to a point that it becomes nearly impossible to get ""into"" the movie. With Spirited, you always felt like there were rules to the world, even if as an outsider you didn't understand them. This never seemed the case with Howl.Furthermore, Miyazaki seems to have dipped into his bag of stock tricks a bit too often. There's little in here that you haven't seen in some form in his previous films. There doesn't appear to be anything new he has to say with this film, it's just retreading the themes that have run throughout his work. I could easily forgive Mononoke as being a thematic remake of Nausicaa, since I feel his message had grown sufficiently in the decade separating those films to be worth repeating. That's not the case here.But, as I said, it's still not a bad film. I suspect people who haven't seen all of Miyazaki's canon will find it quite enjoyable. The richness and nuance of his character animation continues to grow. No one makes more expressive animated figures than Miyazaki, and the characters alone nearly carry the film. And supported by another wonderful score by Joe Hisaishi, as in all of Miyazaki's works, there are moments of staggering beauty rarely seen in films of any genre or style.And despite the incomprehensibility of the plot, he makes it compelling and watchable, even as you have no clue what's going on or why.So, I give the movie an above-average rating and a recommendation, simply on the strength of being a Miyazaki film. The worst of his movies is still better than just about anything else out there. But the purists are likely to be a bit disappointed."
fwomp,"Jun 5, 2006",3/10,"Having little experience in the Anime realm, I have to admit I'm probably not the most knowledgeable reviewer to examine a film such as this. But what I DO feel I'm fairly qualified to do is to evaluate stories. Animated or not, films are a valued method of reaching out to viewers and creating entertainment.Although HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE had some great animation and interesting concepts, the story was so nonsensical in so many places that I found myself shaking my head wondering why I was watching it.The story (if I'm not mistaken) is about Sophie, a young milliner (hatmaker) who lives a mundane life until she's afflicted by a curse put upon her by the (initially) evil Witch of the Waste. The curse comes in the form of age, turning Sophie instantly from a vibrant young girl into a ancient old hag. In order to break the spell, she must find Howl and his moving castle. But with the curse comes the added insult that she cannot tell anyone about it. So once our heroine meets up with Howl, she's unable to tell him what she needs and instead becomes the moving castle's housekeeper.Within the house she finds a young boy who wants to be just like Howl. She also meets and befriends the power that helps keep Howl's castle constantly on the go: a type of fire called Calcifer. And with the castle comes a multitude of problems: Howl's carelessness and difficulties of ""the heart"", a war against outside forces, and the threat of the Witch of the Waste.Again, the animation in the film was great. It was excellently colored and moved in an almost Van Goghish fashion across the screen. But oh the story! There's never an explanation given as to the war that is constantly circling this strange land. Why and how it got started are never fully explained, even though much screen time is given to the machines of war. Why and how the young boy who lives in Howl's castle came to be there are never explained either. Nor is any explanation given to the powers of Calcifer, the fire that drives the castle (the ending touches on it slightly but very ineffectually.) There are plenty of other non-sequiturs but those are the biggest. Too bad, really, as there were some great voices amongst the cast ...from Christian Bale, Billy Crystal and Lauren Bacall just to name a few.I don't mind films that leave a certain amount of exposition up to the viewers interpretation, but there needs to be some rhyme and/or reason for the basic constructs of a movie. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE left me howling for too many explanations."
Raven_Summersong,"Jun 14, 2005",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is another addition to the magic of Miyazaki's long list of masterpieces. Based on the book by Diana Wynne Jones, the film takes the basic premise of the story and takes it into a new direction.The basic story is this: 18-year-old Sophie is a hatter who believes she is an ordinary nobody. But when the witch of the waste curses her to be trapped in the form of a 90-year-old woman, Sophie must go on a grand adventure to find a way to break the curse. Along the way she meets a strange cast of characters including the living scarecrow affectionately dubbed ""Turnip Head"", a wisecracking fire demon, and a mysterious and tragic wizard named Howl.Fans of the book will realize right away that Miyazaki takes great liberties with the source material. While I found this fine, (as the film weaves the tale in a splendid fashion) I did wish that perhaps he had titled the movie differently and added ""Based on Howls Moving Castle"" as the film is more a taking of the IDEA of the book and using it to form a story, than a faithful adaptation of the novel. However, the changes Miyazaki makes works for the film brilliantly, and I have found I like the movie and the book equally.A tale full of magic, romance, excitement, and wonder, this is a highly recommended film for lovers of fairy tales and mythology, as well as Miyazaki fans. It will engage both young and the young at heart."
celtic_eagle,"Oct 4, 2005",9/10,"I saw this today and went in not knowing quite what to expect. I hadn't seen Spirited Away (though now I am motivated to go and rent it), but I had heard people raving and singing praises for Miyazaki's films. Also, I love manga art and to see a movie done in such an elegant style; made my mind up.From the moment the film started, I was enthralled. The music was so incredibly captivating, it swept you along with it and the choice of dialogue was just the right blend of serious, moving, heartwarming, and downright comical. I also have not read the original book this was based ""loosely"" on, so I basically went with a very open mind. On the whole, I really cannot fault this movie. In my opinion, it has something for *everyone*. Adults of all ages, teenagers, kids....I have no doubt that everyone can find something to enjoy in this movie and I would honestly be extremely surprised if anyone came out saying ""Wow...I HATED that!"" As I mentioned before, the music is incredible. It flows so beautifully, and the theme tune was been in my head ever since I walked out the cinema.It was also extremely refreshing to see a film that warms your heart, has no sex scenes or real gore (ie: blood spurting) or swearing and yet still manages to hold its audience in this day and age. *laughs* Just goes to show really. Another thing I really admired was the underlying moral and heartfelt issues throughout. The idea that everyone is beautiful no matter what their physical appearance and also the way the film dealt with the issue of war and the devastation it causes, really made me want to stand up and cheer.Christian Bale was awesome as Howl. His voice seemed to alternate throughout from confident Howl, to crushed and depressed Howl so easily and with such sophistication. I know it is an actor's job to portray different tones of voice but wow....Christian was beyond excellent. At several points, I really felt for Howl and at others, I felt like melting under the sound of such a velvet like voice.Personally, this is the best film I have seen for a long long time and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
AloysiusWeasley,"Oct 23, 2007",10/10,"First off, if you're at ALL a fan of animation, Studio Ghibli, or even just catching a movie that will bring you back to times when things were simpler and people weren't just up for the 'snatch and grab and screw everybody else', you need to see this movie RIGHT NOW. I will admit to being biased, since this *is* my favorite movie of any (animated or not), but honestly, whether you're 7 or 70, this movie is a guaranteed delight. Every time I see this movie, I'm immediately overwhelmed by feelings of wonder, delight, creativity, and hope, and I must say I've definitely seen this movie over 60 times. It doesn't get old, and it's one of those movies where every time you see it, you see something new in the background you'd never noticed before.Okay, on to actually telling you about the movie! The animation and musical score are so far above average it's not even funny. I could watch this with it on mute, and I'd still be struck by the wonder of all the scenery, and the excellent emotional responses of the characters. I could listen to the music from this for HOURS, and if you're any sort of creative person (writer, poet, musician, artist, etc.) it WILL inspire you. Also, I haven't seen the subbed version yet, but unlike many dubbed anime, you will NOT feel like you're being talked down to!Now, this movie is based on a book by Diana Wynne Jones. This is one of the handful of movies where I've watched before I read, and unlike most book to movie adaptations (I loathe nearly all of them), this movie stands on its own with excellence. The book is most certainly a bit different (you will get more of a background on the characters and plot), but for once, I can actually say I loved both equally. It's not necessary to read the book first by any means, but make sure you don't neglect to do so! As a writer, I work with words and their nuances constantly, but even I have immense trouble trying to find words to describe the utter fabulousness of this movie! I'm honestly trying to take a step back and take a critical look at it, but there are NO flaws, no things I would have improved. I wish this movie had actually been released to the public to see in the theaters (I would have had to drive 7 hours to see this when it first came out, and I live very close to a large city - we're talking practically NYC and LA release only!), so many more people could have been struck by the wonder this movie inspires.So if you need an uplift, rent this movie ASAP. Better yet, buy the DVD - it is quite difficult to obtain outside of stores that specialize in anime and the internet, but it is VERY worth it - the DVD has awesome extras and lots of artwork used in the creation of the movie. I PRAY this isn't the last movie Hayao Miyazaki directs!"
janos451,"May 27, 2005",10/10,"Dislocation is rarely a pleasant experience, but when the title object of ""Howl's Moving Castle"" first comes into view, its visual, historical, stylistic ambiguity is downright thrilling.Master animator Hayao Miyazaki (of ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"") once again takes the breath away with his bizarre imagination and richly painted scenes. The enormous lumbering Gothic/sci-fi structure looming over the late-19th century Alsatian (!) cityscape reminds one of Hieronymus Bosch, of Pieter Breughel, of Friedensreich Hundertwasser, and yet remains resolutely unique - it is Miyazaki, and no one else.Neither a Hollywood computer-animated film nor a typical Japanese anime, Miyazaki's work is a phenomenon onto itself.As a movie, ""Castle"" (""Hauru no ugoku shiro""), at 2 hours' running time, is about a half an hour too long. As a work of art, a visual sensation, it's over much too quickly, although it is guaranteed to continue to run in one's mind.Adopting British author Diana Wynne Jones novel, Miyazaki tells the story of Howl, a terrifying and yet insecure wizard/demon; young milliner Sophie, who is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the Witch of the Waste; Calcifer, a fiery little demon, who powers the castle; Markl, Howl's young apprentice; and the mystical Madame Suliman.Heaven forfend that such a work be dubbed (""Spirited Away"" was different - and superior - in the subtitled version), but Miyazaki admirers John Lassater and Pete Docter of Pixar have put heart and soul into the English version, and they succeeded. The voice talent for ""Castle"" is extraordinary: Jean Simmons is old Sophie (the film's main character), Emily Mortimer is the pre-curse Sophie, Laren Bacall makes the evil witch almost lovable, Billy Crystal is Calcifer (not overdoing it), and Christian Bale is Howl.For ""Spirited Away"" fans, ""Castle"" is a must; for those unfamiliar with Miyazaki, this is a splendid introduction to the work of a creative genius."
Movi3DO,"Mar 8, 2021",8/10,"Moving castles and witches. A young but shy girl got cursed into an old woman. Now she accompanied Howl and his moving castle and they went through a journey to help each other during the midst of a war.What I liked about the movie was the stunning visuals. The color and dynamic objects burst life into the movie. However, among the spectacle lied the changes in the two main characters who matured and changed their outlooks on life.The main female character, Sophie, got turned into an old woman, and this sudden leap transformed her character to becoming more confident. This reflects the theme of old age. Miyazaki showed that being old is not bad. Instead, it makes a person more mature, confident, and compassionate.The main male character, Howl, also matured as he remembered his identity and understood responsibility.An obvious theme is the anti-war sentiment. The visual, with its glorious spectacle, also showed the ugly side of war where bombs destroyed houses and people. This is a strong over-arching theme.My main problem with the movie was its fairly fast pace. As the beautiful visuals assaulted my eyes, there were a lot of things going on, and I got a bit confused on couple of scenes.Overall, a beautiful fantasy with complex characters. 8/10"
dballred,"Dec 2, 2004",8/10,"First of all, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this film and intend to see it several more times. On a technical level, Miyazaki has elevated the traditional 2-D animated film above the cheesier but more realistic 3-D Computer-generated works that seem to prevail everywhere else. Whether he used computers to simulate the 2-D look is beyond my current knowledge, but I applaud his attempt to abandon the technique that even crept into his previous work, _Spirited Away_.The film is *very* loosely based on the original novel. In fact, only the basic premise and the main characters seem to have survived Miyazaki's scalpel. As a story, it is unimaginative and trite. Furthermore, the characters lacked depth. Unlike he did with _Kiki's Delivery Service_, Miyazaki failed to improve upon the original work.All is forgiven, though. This is one-hundred percent pure uncut Miyazaki. I was left with the impression that he was going to have fun with a project, this was the project, and he had a great deal of fun with it. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided excellent musical support. I gave this film an 8."
vithiet,"Jan 20, 2024",6/10,"Considering this was the only one of the commonly accepted top 3 Miyazaki movies I had yet to watch, my expectations were pretty high. Unfortunately I found it to be a far cry from Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Not that it's necessarily a bad movie; it's very pretty visually, and has a certain poetic charm. But I found the story to be severely lacking and most of all the characters are completely uninteresting, which is very unlike other Miyazaki movies. At the end of the day it was a nice enough watch but I'll never find myself wanting to watch it again and I would recommend many other Miyazaki before this one."
lippp-1,"Jun 2, 2006",2/10,"Sometimes reviews assume lives of their own. That seems to be the most plausible reason this film has received so much praise. Yes, it is very visual at times. At other times not so impressive. For example the fire in the castle could have been drawn by a talented fourth grader. But the real elephant in room everyone seems to be overlooking is this film has a very confused, hard to follow plot. In fact the director, Hayao Miyazaki, has as much said he agrees. So why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise. I suspect the average movie goer will not be happy with Howl's Moving Castle. When you pay almost $10.00 per ticket you don't really care about credentials, you want to be entertained. And watching visuals just goes so far before you know you've been snookered. Instead, rent ""The Triplets of Belleville"" if you want to see creative animation at it's best."
sach96,"Jun 11, 2005",10/10,"I saw the movie in Japanese and loved it. I liked the visuals and the story. I bought the book after seeing it and - I might be in the minority here - I didn't like it as much as the movie. While not bad at all I couldn't relate to any of the characters of the book, I found Sophie annoying and closed-minded and Howl's character was quite one dimensional imo. I prefer the movie which I think does a wonderful job in taking some of the original ideas of the book and creating a new and wonderful story even if it doesn't follow the book. I also think the characters in the movie are much more likable. I would still recommend seeing/reading both the move and the book."
qball_82,"Jun 12, 2005",8/10,"I love these experiences I get from Miyazaki, I never fail to be moved or affected in some way after watching one of his films. Whether it's transporting the viewer to another world completely or simply portraying the subtle visual nuances of a character, not many film makers can compare.Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderfully bizarre, imaginative tale and serves as the perfect basis for Miyazaki's vision and style. Though it's not quite up there with Spirited Away or Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki doesn't disappoint and the film is filled with breathtaking visuals, charming characters, humor, romance, drama, all of it. I was a little apprehensive seeing the dubbed version, but my doubts were unfounded as the English actors all did a great job.I had a couple of minor gripes about the film. The story doesn't seem as solid and cohesive as Miyazaki's earlier works, if I had to use one word to describe it it would be ""scattered"". The characters also seem to lack the depth of those in other Miyazaki films and I would think this is because much of their histories and motives are left unexplained, the viewer is left to simply accept them as they are, left wanting more.Compared to other Miyazaki films, Howl's Moving Castle doesn't quite feel as complete. Compared to any other animated offering out there, this film (along with the rest of Miyazaki's), is in a league of its own. An amazing film experience - do not miss it!"
suelynnmarie,"Mar 9, 2006",10/10,"I really have enjoyed all of his movies and this was my favorite. Over the past couple years I have seen almost all of his films and am always impressed with them. I really liked how imaginative this one was. His films are always imaginative, but I have never seen a movie push my imagination that far. Plus, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I just wanted to know more and more about the world they were in.He truly creates an entire other world that doesn't abide by the rules of what we know. This allowed me to discover them with the girl as she was introduced to a world she hadn't known. I was able to identify with her and Miyazaki sends such a good message with her character. I am a huge fan of this movie and cannot wait to own it."
Buddy-51,"Aug 27, 2006",8/10,"What do you get when you combine the master Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki (""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Spirited Away"") with the British sci-fi novelist Diana Wynne Jones? The answer is ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" an enchanting (if not altogether understandable) animated feature, filled with beauty, imagination and magic.Sophie is a shy young girl, working in her family's hat shop, who falls under the spell of a witch who turns her into a decrepit old woman. At a loss as to what to do, Sophie decides to leave home and try to find a cure for her condition in the mysterious land of wizards and witches that lies just outside her city. Not long after she arrives, she encounters the mysterious ""moving castle,"" owned by the enigmatic wizard known as Howl, that not only roams freely around the countryside but seems to exist in any number of different dimensions at the same time. It's when she passes through the castle door and discovers what awaits her inside that the really surreal adventure begins.There's little point in trying to figure out all the fine details of the story, which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along - and not always in a way that is completely satisfying to those of us who are trying desperately to understand it. Yet, there is a certain fascination in the way the film chooses to defy all the rules of time and space and feels no real compunction to explain how all of it is supposed to work. The movie asks us to merely accept what we are seeing at face value and to go along wherever it is it wants to take us. This is an easy thing to do, primarily because the film's incredible beauty seduces us into accepting the slightly weird alternate reality the movie has set up for us. Although the animators are all Japanese, the characters themselves are Occidental and the film appears to be set sometime in the late Victorian or early Edwardian era of a century ago. The visuals are so exquisite in every detail that it is virtually impossible for us to turn our eyes from the screen even for a split second. Like the best animated films, it transports us to a world that is both utterly fantastic and strangely familiar at the same time.In bringing the characters to life, the English-language version employs an impressive cast of voices, including veterans Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner, along with Billy Crystal, Emily Mortimer and Christian Bale.With its occasionally incoherent storyline and deliberate pacing, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" may disappoint and frustrate those accustomed to the more simple, hectic and frenetic animated films churned out regularly by Hollywood. But if you're in the mood for a calmer, more relaxing trip to a world not your own, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" provides just the right vehicle to take you there."
danielarreba,"Mar 2, 2006",9/10,"Hauru no ugoku shiro is one of the most amazing animated films that I've seen in a long time. Alredy tired of Disney/Pixar paraphernalia, Hayao Miyazaki's film is fresh air in our mouth. And a sparkling scratch in our eyes. Definitely Miyazaki is a creator who has chosen animated films as the best way to express his ideas. Sophie is a young lady living a bored life in some place in Europe (not defined), at the beginning of XX century (not defined either). War times, and this is an important issue in the meaning of the film. Miyazaki is a pacifist and this movie can prove it. Howl, the young-beautiful man blessed (or punished, it all depends how you look at him)with magic powers, is a struggler who fights at nights breaking down anachronic war ships . Even more, he refused kingdom call which pretends he fights in the front. Sophie will be victim of the trick made by an evil witch (later we will find out that the same witch has been cheated)becoming in an 90 years old woman. Without hope, she'll rove until to find a fantastic roding castle with strange people living in it. The movie takes an oniric twist, in which logic is suspended, plot back and forth following undetermined parameters, as the castle does it.Hauru no ugoku shiro is a powerful visually film, which is not afraid to play with fantasy. It's a political film too."
chaos-rampant,"Apr 2, 2025",N/A,"The effort here is for symbolic imagination in a European way, painterly rather than the Japanese presence of something like Totoro. It is based on a teenage book by a British author after all.Within this there are some lovely flights of fancy that Miyazaki enables and in spite of a convoluted story - it makes almost no sense in the last half hour viewers agree - there is a heartfelt journey.You will probably need to salvage it out of the increasing wreckage of story. But it goes something like this in my own reading.The shy, unassuming girl who works at a hat shop. The other women around the shop clamor for a hearthrob boy but she keeps her head down, focusing on her work. Maybe she likes him too, but she probably thinks this is not for her.In a normative mode he would be someone who came around the shop or they passed on the street - in this symbolic world he appears on his magical castle in the horizon.In the first imaginative flight of the film this same boy magically appears to her on the street, even suavely protects her from two lecherous soldiers, and literally sweeps her off her feet for a flight over the city.Landing at her sister's bakery, her sister urges her to look for life outside their father's hat shop, look out for herself -warning that she's going to end up a spinster. And so what happens in the film? That same night she's turned into a frail old lady.That sets off a story where she goes looking for him, to maybe reverse this spell (it is, we find out, an old witch's spell, a rival, born from unrequited love). Instead she comes to live inside this castle - not as romantic interest, of course, but in an equally unassuming role, as cleaning lady.This is a house of magic, of fictive and illusory appearances. We find out that it simultaneously opens up to different kingdoms, these are embroiled in war; probably a lot more of that war story is found in the book but only odd snippets make the film.Even in its disjointed state this was captivating to see. The boy's own heart is keeping the armored house alive, elusive magic that keeps everyone away. Turns out this dashing hero is himself insecure inside - whimsically, having his hair painted the wrong color brings forth shadows and doom (a rather teenage kind)My favorite bit - a certain reflection of mortality and passing onto the other shore as old Sophie weeps by the shore.There is a lot of jousting, symbolic transformations and action-packed destruction near the end. But story-wise it starts to fall apart. At one point they evacuate the castle, causing it to fall in ruins - only to go back in and try to restore it in the immediate next scene.Symbolically she has taken his heart out of the armor. His love for her makes her young again. She puts it back in his body, ""a heart can be a heavy thing"" after all, but essential to live.I'm not well versed in Japanese animation at all - and probably never will be. But compared to the American product, you won't find something like this."
zbarlas,"Feb 5, 2024",7/10,"I have to admit the plot was definitely hard to keep up with. And there were so many unanswered questions in the storyline. However, I think that weird heterogenous elements fit with the theme of the story. Like the family is full of different characters... a young boy, a grandma, a fire demon, an old witch, a grandma, an odd dog, a wizard, and a scarecrow?And I think that speaks to the theme of family. Family does not need to be restricted by the boundaries of blood. Instead, it can grow and there is always room for more. The house grows, the characters grew closer to one another, and many were forgiven. Even Calcifer, the fire demon, who desperately wanted to escape the castle -- returned back because he missed them.The theme was definitely about finding a chosen family, which I found quite beautiful."
JayWolfgramm,"Jul 9, 2023",4/10,"I'm a big fan of Miyazaki...but I can't stand ""Howl's Moving Castle"". People keep telling me, ""oh, you just don't get it. Watch it again and give it another chance."" I have now sat through this film 4 times in English and 1 time in Japanese, and I stand by my original statement, I don't like it. Typically, when I run into a Studio Ghibli fan, their favorite anime film is going to be ""Howl's Moving Castle"". I typically respond to them that the film isn't even Miyazaki's best film about a castle that moves...heck it's not even his second best.My review may come across more negative than the rating would suggest, mainly because I feel I have to balance out all the praise this movie already receives. It is on IMDb's top 250 movies, and frequently finds itself at the top of animation lists. I will remind people that it did not win Best Animated Feature that year. It lost to ""Wallace and Gromit"" which is a decision that I stand by.Any ways let me get the positives out of the way. Like all Miyazaki films, the movie looks gorgeous. It is beautifully animated for both wide landscapes and close detail. The voice acting is also top notch. There is a wonderful amount of imagination on display in the film. Sometimes that imagination runs off of dream logic nonsense, but it is imaginative.I have heard people say that this is a great romance movie. Really? If someone were to pause the movie with 10 minutes left and asked me: ""What do you think this film is about?"" I would eventually say, ""the danger of over relying on magic to solve all your problems?"" They would then say, ""nope"" show the last 10 minutes and tell me: ""It was all about the romance between Howl and Sophie"" Up until that moment, there was absolutely no romantic chemistry between the two. They share relatively little screen time together. And when they are together, there is nothing but a series of red flags from Howl. Is Sophie getting into the relationship thinking: ""I can fix him.""?I heard other people say that this film is a powerful anti-war movie. How? The war is happening completely in the background. We don't see any war-torn consequences; the people live in a magical castle. The conflict of the war is resolved in one of the most ludicrously simple solutions ever. Without spoiling anything, I will just say the war is concluded through the equivalent of a 12 second Skype call.Best I can figure, the movie makes a lot more sense if you read the book it is based on, almost as if this movie is an addendum to the book. I never had this problem with Miyazaki's other films. Nobody has trouble following Kiki, Totoro or Nausicaa without doing homework beforehand.The ending is full of plot devices that were not introduced nor explained earlier in the film. The finale is so out of left field that anyone walking in would have just as much ability to follow what is happening as the people who watched the whole movie. Characters make decisions that make no sense with what was set up earlier. Pick a lane witch of the waste, are you a villain or just a senile old lady. I'm fine with some things being left to audience interpretation, but I feel I don't have enough information to make any sort of guess on what is going on.The movie is paced like it is a slice of life simple story, something like ""Kiki's Delivery Service"". But then the last 10 minutes treats it like it is this grand epic that they were building up to all along. No, no they weren't. None of the finale follows what was set up before. I don't buy the romance, and I don't buy the war. And when it is a slice of life cleaning anime, I'm too distracted by the main character's curse to relax. Oh yeah, Sophie is cursed to be old. I only mention in now because 15 minutes in she pretty much stops caring about it.Clearly a lot of people like it. If you want to figure out what they see in it, you can read one of their reviews. But for me, I just don't get it. I was not moved."
thesouthernpansy,"Jun 11, 2005",9/10,"I just returned from seeing the Japanese version with English subs thanks to an International Film Festival and I have to say... Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli crew do not disappoint with this one. Whether you're a Miyazaki virgin or a devoted fan, this film is all-around excellent and I'm definitely planning on seeing it again. Perhaps the English version the next time around.One of the things that stood out for me the most was the sheer volume of references to his other movies that were included. Half the fun was picking out scenes and characters that echoed ones in Tonari no Totoro, Spirited Away... quite a few, really. The movie was laugh-out-loud funny all the way through (the whole theatre was in hysterics) and they did an excellent job of balancing the humor with the drama so that neither detracted from the other. There was one scene closer to the end that I was a bit confused on involving the castle, and one of the overarching plot themes involving a war seemed to be lacking motivation, but otherwise there weren't any plot nitpicks. I'm very interested in reading the book now--those who had read it seemed to think the movie adaptation was pretty faithful.Aside from the feeling that maybe Miyazaki should branch out from the 'young girl coming-of-age' story, I very much enjoyed the characters. The heroine, Sophie, is likable both as a teen and an elderly woman, and as with many of the other characters, it is interesting to see her character (both physically and mentally) change throughout the story. The dynamic characters definitely kept the pace moving and even seeming-villains could become likable in a matter of minutes without seeming forced. And for you anime fangirls out there... yes, Howl is a bish. A very likable one too, even as he's complaining about his constant need to be pretty. He's another very dynamic character and one that I enjoyed watching immensely.You must see the movie for yourself to really appreciate what Studio Ghibli has done this time around. Employing a visual style much closer to Spirited Away than to former works, their constant creativity is astounding. Howl's Moving Castle is a masterpiece that ties the family of Miyazaki movies together, yet stands on its own as a true work of art. Run, don't walk. And I mean it. I was wearing heels."
irineufdaniel,"Oct 31, 2022",10/10,"This movie was an amazing surprise to me. The history is beautiful, the main character is good and the whole plot talks about family, love and appreciate the little beautiful things of life.I love fantasy and this movie is full of magic, with witches, spells and fantastic creatures. Still, the message of peace and courage is very relatable to our world.I have read the book in which this movie is based and, even though the movie has some significant differences, they made a very beautiful plot. Some answers are a little vague, like everything regarding the cause of the war and the scarecrow, but that is because they changed this aspects from the book (the war does not have so much focus on the book and the scarecrow has much more). Another thing that gets lose is Sophie's mother participation in the end (what was her goal?).However, this details are not important for the main plot, and the studio likes to pass meaningful messages (like the horror of war).This is a great movie for the entire family and I was very surprised is not more famous and didn't get more recognition.Definitely worth the watch."
bsinc,"Nov 14, 2005",9/10,"I was never a big fan of anime cartoons, to me they seemed very two-sided. On one side you have incredibly fluent and perfectly drawn mind-boggling details, which are mainly used in action scenes, and on the other side you have those crude repetitive monotonous moments of people walking, opening their mouths or just chunks of hair dangling in the wind's breeze where it almost feels as if the animation department is rushing and simplifying their job. ""Hauru No Ugoku Shiro"" starts exactly like the latter and I jumped to a conclusion way too soon. Because what I was about to see was nothing less than magic. I forgot the last time a movie captivated me so strongly, the last time I truly felt that kid I once used to be-this movie delivered big -time. Such creativity and pure fantasy extravaganza is almost unheard of today, yet Hayao Miyazaki lets us indulge in it with such ease and simplistic honesty it feels as if he's the only person in the world with imagination worth mentioning. And his definitely is! A colorful palette of characters and a beautiful story are the key element why this movie is worth seeing.Recommendations: anyone who misses feeling like the child they were, people who miss creative movies.9/10"

luzon_1,"Sep 30, 2005",9/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is quite possibly one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in years. It's simply gorgeous, and I came out of the movie theatre in the most amazing mood.I only discovered Hayao Miyazaki a couple of years ago, and so this was my first chance to view one of his movies at the cinema. I have copies of Spirited Away, Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke, and so walked into Howl's Moving Castle with very high expectations. I was not disappointed. The animation is rich and lush, with the characters delightful to watch. The voice acting was also a pleasant surprise. Whilst I am a fan of watching anime films in Japanese with the English subtitles, the theatre showing Howl's Moving Castle was only showing it dubbed. I was slightly worried about this, but should not have. Billy Crystal, and Christian Bale in particular,were fantastic. Lauren Bacall's voice and tone perfectly embodied her character's spirit. It is one of the few movies that I have not winced through because of poor voice acting. Howl's Moving Castle is a sensory delight and although many critics have suggested it is not on par with Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, I would have to disagree. I believe it to be right up there.A most thoroughly enjoyable and amazing movie, for all fans of majestic films."
lorenzodininno,"Sep 5, 2022",6/10,"I didn't read the novel and i guess that's why i was so confused when the movie ended.After that i looked up the eplanation of the whole story and ending and realised there's so much this movie doesn't tell us: the curses, why there is a war, who the witch is and what she really wants, etc. It is almost impossible to figure those things out on our own without a little context.It is a shame because it could've been a great experience but instead, for me, it was just two hours of trying -and failing- to understand the plot. Damn 600 characters is a lot. Damn 600 characters is a lot Damn 600 characters is a lot."

It totally blows your brains away, and i was all twitchy afterwards and could not stop thinking about it- I had to go home and read the book twice before i calmed down totally.I am now absolutely obsessed by this film. It enthrals you totally from when Sophie first meets Howl ( flying over the rooftops to escape from black blobs- how cool is that?) until the ending, (which i will not spoil.)You cannot describe how good this film is- you just have to see it for yourself. It is so much better than Disney, but because it is not a big Hollywood movie it wasn't advertised very well. All the little kids who saw it were gasping and enjoying it far better than some cheesy run of the mill Disney.The graphics are Amazon, the music is so subtle yet perfect, and the characters are fantastic. It is the best animated film I have ever seen."
kemiktorbasikaciran,"Feb 1, 2021",10/10,"I have watched it at least 10 times. I'm watching it with my nephews now. I wish the continuation would come.

If I can still watch it without getting tired, it's because they've done such a great job."
Chiglet,"Jul 3, 2005",10/10,"Hayao Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is one of the best motion pictures I have seen in 2005. Even better than his last movie, ""Spirited Away"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" draws the viewer into a world where magic and technology have developed along side each other. While appealing to audiences of all ages, This film is reminiscent the heart and spirit of the early Disney films.I normally see a movie only once in the theatres, and even fewer do I consider/plan to purchase. I definitely plan on seeing it (again) in the theatre at least one more time, and will be one of the first in line when the DVD is released for sale."
jimpage666,"Aug 21, 2005",10/10,"This film is fantastic. The voices, visuals, and story are all top notch. Best scene: When Howl starts summoning dark spirits cuz he's depressed. Kids 7 and up will be able to deal with the war aspect, even if they don't get the surreal parts. The story is less a 'war epic' and more a love story. The end is a bit too quick. But its really the journey that counts, no? The kid's disguise cracked me up. Actually there were lots of laughs and lots of wonder. Hilarious, serious, and touching. My girlfriend started crying. The dog and witch being woven into the story seemed kind of rushed. Sophie rocks. Can't wait for the DVD. This one is worth seeing in the theatre."
AstelleVey,"Sep 26, 2021",N/A,"Whilst visually appealing, this movie makes no sense. It fails to create any interesting or dynamic characters, but instead adds forced chemistry, in this unexplored world where the plot and history is just confusing or unknown. Watching the grass grow is more enjoyable than watching something that's this boring and frustrating. Furthermore, compared to other Ghibli movies, this soundtrack is also disappointing and forgettable."

zephyr24-1,"Mar 5, 2005",8/10,"After the Oscar-winning Sprited Away by Hayou Miyazaki, the skates are high for his next animated feature. His adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' 2001 book Howl's Moving Castle is no doubt an unrivaled animated feature featuring sorcery and wizards against the backdrop of war and a sweet romance.While the animation is lively and the effects are stunning, the whimsical adaptation suffered from too much layering of plot. There may be occasions where one may be lost in the plot. Though this definitely does not affect my enjoyment of the movie, I thought it would have benefited from better continuity. I have not read the original book but it's surely not an easy task to bring a book to life through the painstaking process of animating every single frame."
cinephiliac,"Oct 1, 2005",4/10,"'Incredibly disappointing' would be a short (if not sweet) summary. Or maybe just 'average', which is the worst thing you could possibly say about a film from a director who had previously sought to delight through imagination and vibrancy.In Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki struggles to find original ground and ends up retreading now increasingly familiar ideas and motifs from his previous work, even the opening title sequence seems to reuse music from his breakout hit Spirited Away. We have a teenage girl (Sophie, the protagonist), a silent and ineffective partner (Turnip-head), a humorous sidekick (Calcifer), a collection of wishy-washy tag-alongs (Markl & co), vague enemies which are totally unexplored, and a mysterious and largely undeveloped male teenager, who here happens to be the titular Howl. All characters also suffer from abysmal phoned-in performances for the English dub (I can't comment on the original), in particular Christian Bale (Howl) who barely varies his delivery throughout, and Emily Mortimer (Sophie) who gives an appallingly flat performance for the lead. Only the ever-reliable Billy Crystal gives value for money as the fire daemon Calcifer, though it's nothing incredibly special - more accurately simply a cut-price Robin Williams.Elsewhere there are more significant problems. The story is a mess both in terms of plotting and pacing and scripting. It begins well enough but falls into predictable buddy-buddy routines all too early, fails to head in any clear direction for a long time and then ends on a half-hearted note (which is to say ridiculously hokey) with a total non-conclusion. Whole ideas are thrown into the mix and left unexplained, like the war which is at the center of the action, the king (queen?), the other wizards. Miyazaki could arguably be even trying to say something about the Iraq war, with a myriad of none too subtle contemporary references, but even that didactic aspect is lost.You will likely not leave the cinema satisfied, unless you are ten years old - and even the kids behind me were bored to tears long before the finishing line. A rethink is needed over at Ghibli studios..4/10."
Kiarie,"Sep 2, 2005",10/10,"Wow. This is THE most amazing movie I have -ever- seen, I repeat, -EVER-, and not just in a range of Miyazaki and anime movies, though Howl's Moving Castle has given me whiplash when bypassing Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke by a mile long-shot. This is the story of a young hatter named Sophie (Zofi) who is the oldest of two (three in the book) daughters and believes the fairytale rule of the-first-is-always-the-worst. On her way to visiting her sister Lettie she bumps into two drunken soldiers who flirt shamelessly. She is saved by a handsome young man, who takes her on a ""stroll through the sky"" while escaping from ""ravenous globs of black goo"". When she returns home she meets an obese, ugly lady-later known to be the Witch of the Waste-who curses her into turning into a 90-year-old-woman. The next morning Sophie leaves her home, attempting to get as far from the town as possible. And she ends up in the house belonging to said handsome young man: Howl (Hauru). If I say any more, you would be spoiled. I have seen this movie 5 times in theatres and plan to buy the DVD, rumored to be coming out in November. If you don't see this movie and are yet an anime/manga/Miyazaki fan, it would be a loss that might cause the end of the world. At least in -my- opinion."
jlevy-11,"Jun 22, 2005",10/10,"When I saw that Miyazaki had come out with another film in the US I was so excited. Getting to see his works feels like an honor because every movie he has made is a work of art. He makes his imagination come alive. Howl's Moving Castle is the first of his movies that I have seen in theaters and I felt like I wasn't even in a theater. Getting to experience one of Hayao Miyazaki's films on the big screen was just amazing. I love animation and I love seeing other worlds come to life. If you have an active imagination and love animation as much as I do, this is a movie that you have to see(I am avoiding saying anything about the movie so that you can fully experience it for yourself). This is the first movie I have seen that I didn't want to end because it was that wonderful."
kevin86,"Mar 8, 2006",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is phenomenal. Presenting itself initially in an odd way, our protagonist Sophie seems somewhat dry and dull. But this lasts only a few moments until a series of fantastical characters pour into her world. Each of these characters, whether it be Calcifer, Markl, Turniphead, the Witch of the Waste (during the last half) or the quiet dog are immediately likable from the get go. You genuinely care about them and their constant references to one another as a family only make the group seem all the more close. It's not very often I'm immediately pulled in by a group of characters but the colorful cast of Howl's Moving Castle are quick to bore a place in memory.The animation quality is also superb. Vibrant colors and visuals fill every frame and a great attention to detail is thoroughly evident from beginning to end. Though at times it may seem very basic in style, take a second look as every frame holds something distinctively unique and profound in its beautiful fashion. Howl's dazzling transformations are superbly animated throughout his personal endeavors of self-loathing, missing love, and thirst for power. Wheteher he be taking the form of an enormous blue bird or enshrouding himself in the company of dark spirits during a bout of depression, Howl is a spectacle all on his own. The castle he inhabits along with his family is also a treat to the senses. Other than the obviousness of how distinctively creative and complex the outermost appearance of the moving castle is; the magical functions it performs are just as remarkable and interesting. This magnificent creation serves not only as a haven to our heroes but also as a portal to both time and space. It is a mystical labyrinth filled with humorous and surprising secrets and feats at every turn.The film has a lot to say on love, life, loyalty, war, bravery, and family. And it succeeds gracefully in bringing all these themes together in a very thoughtful and stirring manner. By the films end there is a lot left lingering with you. I found myself thinking about the film as a whole long into the credits' enchanting music. The overall brilliance of its unfolding story, captivating characters, moving relationships, strong themes, elegant visual beauty, and thrilling conflicts is more than I've experienced in a long time in terms of animated films. Yes his last too works Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke were also brilliantly captivating, but Howl's Moving Castle just stood out to me as something extra special in Miyazaki's body of work with Studio Ghibli.I have seen all of Miyazaki's films with the exception of Kiki's Delivery Service and must say that Howl's Moving Castle is one of Miyazaki's most impressive accomplishes to date. The Academy Award for Best Animated Picture was robbed from this delightful and exciting adventure. I'd have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is my second favorite Miyazaki film, surpassed only by Nausicaa of The Valley of th Wind. Like Nausicaa, this film was grossly overlooked by both general viewers and critics alike. Heres hoping that the DVD release garners more great rating from viewers on this deserving gem."

The movie is very different than the book, but those who read it will recognize some parts fro the book.I don't care if it wasn't 100% true to the original book, it's still a wonderful movie to see. The background, characters, animation, and voice talents is all top notch. Plus Billy crystal is perfect with his role, one of the main things that made this movie have funny moments.Those who liked Hayao Miyazaki's previous films will enjoy this one.

The animation couldn't have been better, and at times even verge on genius. The character of Sofi moves so naturally from the young girl to the old woman that you completely believe that they are one person. Sometimes you will catch a turn of the old woman's face and see the perfect reflection of the young girl that is trapped inside. This is something only the greatest of artists can accomplish.Where the movie breaks down is in it's mishmash of a plot and it's few likable characters. Other than the love story going on here the plot is hollow and lacks any motivation. It seems like there's a whole lot going on in the background that we need to know for it to make sense. Everything is ambiguous, and nothing is ever tied up to any real satisfaction. Then, suddenly a plot point will jump out, make an appearance, and never be resolved. I find this unfortunate.It's sad when of all the characters in the story the one that makes the biggest impression on me is Hin the dog. This weird little mutt steals every scene he's in! Oh, I think the characters of Sofi and the Witch of the Waste are well developed (particularly the Witch of the waste) but other than that I couldn't get involved with anyone. Even Howl seemed one dimensional and lack lustered.It doesn't help that I was forced to endure Disney's typically poor translation and awful cast. With the notable exceptions of Jean Simmons and Lauren Bacall I thought the casting uninspired. Billy Crystal is particularly bad. He takes what should be, and is, a very important character to the story and makes a poor joke out of it. Un-funny and unsympathetic, he almost single handedly ruined the film for me.As a Followup to ""Spirited Away"" this movie was a disappointment for me, but even though I consider it Miazaki's worst film you must consider the caliber of his other films. Everything he touches is magic. The worst Miazaki film is still far superior to almost everything else comparable. This could easily be one of the 5 best movies of the year, however the competition isn't that great.It's worth seeing."
diand_,"Aug 21, 2005",6/10,"Miyazaki creates several worlds in an anti-war tale set in a 19th century small England town in the grip of war. Sophie gets a spell on her by the Witch of the Waste and enters as an old lady Howl's moving castle hoping to make it undone. What follows is an incredible imaginative story where real and fantasy elements mix to create a movie universe where literally anything can happen.The castle / house has one door that can lead to any of four worlds. One is the ordinary world, where Sophie comes from, to make clear that ordinary people suffer from war as they lead their lives. The second leads to a capital city (London?), where power is exercised and war decisions are made by a king. The king is also under a kind of 'spell' as his power is almost taken over by the witch Madam Sulliman, deciding on war and peace (her loyal dog follows Sophie by the way). The way up to the top is long and steep, as there is also a large distance between ordinary citizens and the king, between not having power and having power.The third world is the world of magic and fantasy, only entered by Howl through the black state. As there is also war in this world, i.e. between good and bad, this is a mirror of the war in the real world. The last world is of peace and quiet, but only shows landscapes and almost no people in it, it can both stand for a post-apocalyptic world or for heaven. All these worlds and their boundaries are not strictly defined; a certain world often assimilates into any of the other worlds.As Howl starts winning the peace, Sophie grows younger again, the whole aging process an indication of the suffering of people under war. But Howl pays an increasing high price for his war involvement, as he starts having black feathers. Besides space shifting in the story, time shifting is also used; Howl is at the end under a spell after his battles and only saved much later by Sophie. Calcifer is Howl's heart and soul, therefore almost dead due to his war actions in the fantasy world; even his masterpiece the castle is falling apart as a result of that. The Witch of the Waste meanwhile, is turned into a friendly grandma, indicating she was used by the powers in the fantasy world like a politician or a soldier would be in the real world.The animation is traditional, as always from Ghibli. Most viewers think computer animation is not used at all here, but there is some limited use. The pacing is somewhat slow, its war story is interesting but not that compelling, so we have to rely on Miyazaki's almost unlimited imagination to keep us involved.One advice: if you can see this in its original (Japanese) version."
jennyhor2004,"Dec 24, 2011",3/10,"Up to and including ""Spirited Away"", the animated films by Studio Ghibli are of a high standard both technically and in spirit. With ""Howl's Moving Castle"", the soulful quality of the earlier films that peaked with ""Princess Mononoke"" disappears and what we get is an empty shell of a story that exploits typical Studio Ghibli motifs and themes and the studio's technical virtuosity. All the familiar devices of earlier films – a young female protagonist on the verge of adulthood, elderly women, a flawed hero with shamanic characteristics, heroes and villains manipulated by more powerful characters of uncertain quality, sophisticated flying technology in an alternative 19th-century steampunk world – are worked over in a fantasy aimed (cynically it seems to me) at a mainstream Western audience and the result looks very cheesy and manipulative with an ulterior message that superficially celebrates female bravery but channels it into socially restrictive roles.The story's heroine is a plain-jane working-class hat-maker called Sophie who accidentally meets a young wizard Howl and so arouses the jealousy of the Witch of the Waste who turns her into an old woman. Sophie runs away and meets a scarecrow called Turnip who takes her to Howl's over-sized trailer-park home. Here she meets a fire demon called Calcifer and Howl's child assistant Markl. Sophie insinuates herself into Calcifer, Markl and Howl's lives by claiming to be a cleaning-woman and through her association with the unlikely trio, is drawn into a war between Howl's country and an enemy realm missing its Crown Prince; during the film's course the war also moves into Sophie's country. Howl is forced to participate in this war at the cost of eventually losing his humanity through repeated transformations into a bird creature. Sophie comes to realise that Howl and the Witch of the Waste are pawns of more powerful forces, represented in part by Madame Suliman, the former mentor of Howl, and Sophie's work for the rest of the film is cut out trying to locate Howl's missing heart, the mysterious connection between Howl and Calcifer, ending the war and locating the missing Crown Prince.Working out all the different strands of the film and connecting them together might take viewers 2 – 3 viewings which would expose them to an excess of saccharine musical schmaltz and a deadly ""love conquers all"" radiation cloud in the tradition of Beauty-and-the-Beast stories. I think if I had to sit through this film again, my hair and teeth will start falling out, my skin will break out into ulcers and bruises will mysteriously appear and spread. Characters are poorly developed and the love Sophie feels for the feckless Howl is so unbelievable as to be laughable; she would have been better off taking her chances with Turnip who performs a noble act of voluntary self-sacrifice in comparison with Howl who fights because he is compelled to, not out of free will.The war merely forms a backdrop to the events and all the various characters can do is try to stop it without understanding anything about the lead-up to it and why Suliman forces Howl to do her dirty work; or participate in it. Even the animation of the war and its participants looks like a cut-and-paste job of previous Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli films like ""Nausicaa of the Valley of Winds"", ""Porcorosso"", ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" and ""Princess Mononoke"": several flying machines look like those giant bug monsters of ""Nausicaa "" with wing-flaps added as an afterthought. Backgrounds are visually gorgeous at first but turn out to be generic according to the role they have to play so, for example, town scenes have a dreamy alternative-universe quality similar to scenes in ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" which takes place in a similar alternative 1950s universe that might well follow on in the future from ""Howl's Moving Castle"".The film is too long and its story is too intricate to work as a family film, the characters are shallow and implausible, the animation is cynically overwhelming and unoriginal. Worst of all is the film's message about what happens to girls eventually: they get to play brave heroines for a brief while and once they are adults, they can be either beautiful scheming bitches like Suliman or domestic-goddess workaholics like the geriatric Sophie slaving away for love. Issues like the nature of war – Miyazaki made the movie partly in protest at the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 – are sidelined so much that all the eye- blinking in the world couldn't make them more missed. No way in the world would I recommend this film for families with young daughters. I feel so cheated having seen it."
Chapaev36,"Jun 30, 2005",10/10,"I went to see Miyazaki's newest work ""Howl's Moving Castle"" with some minor trepidation. This was not a pet project for him from the start so I had reservations as to whether it would be able to match the visual mastery of his earlier works. I was delighted to find out that Miyazaki delivered a film that has become an instant favorite with me.Being a Miayzaki enthusiast, I have seen all of the master's feature length directorial efforts. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" now only trails ""My Neightbour Totoro"" as my favorite Miyazaki work. What works for me the most in this film is that Miyzaki was able to join together the best of his early and later film-making traits into a brilliant baroque work of art. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" possesses the innocence and quiet beauty of his earlier films and the haunting, darker, more brooding excellence of ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"".As with ""Mononoke"" and ""Nausicaa"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a deviation of a previous Miyazaki film. It is, in many ways, reminiscent to Laputa: Castle In The Sky when one considers elements such as Howl's castle paralleled with the castle of Laputa, the central theme of war and the multidimensional villains (or are they? Consider how Miyazaki's characters are rarely purely evil, as there are layers of goodness in all of them).There is a scene in this film that had me in awe and made me realize that I was witnessing a masterpiece within a masterpiece. It is delightfully underplayed. When Howl sends old Sophie to see madame Suliman she winds up climbing a dreadfully long set of stairs with the witch of the waste on the way to Suliman's castle. I was astounded with Miyazaki's craftsmanship here. First of all, the visuals are astounding and and humorously over-the-top. Miyazaki wickedly underscores the age of Sophie and the obesity of the witch of the west to bring out the humanity of both of these characters, their weaknesses in particular. Miyazaki is also very consistently patient here - one would expect in a Disney movie for the director to simply cut from the bottom of the stairs to the top of the stairs as the characters come to the entrance but he lets the viewer in on this amusing experience. There are nice subtle touches here like Suliman's dog who is carried by Sophie to make the experience even more strenuous for her. Miyazaki also goes to great lengths to show Sophie's kindness - this first becomes evident on the stairs when she is surprisingly sympathetic to the witch, developing into a central themes of the film - the theme of kindness, forgiveness and understanding.These characters are multidimensional, they have human traits and allow the viewer to identify. Miyazaki's approach is the complete polar opposite to that of American animators who worked on cartoons like the roadrunner and the coyote or Bugs Bunny. These characters are mortal - they feel pain, they feel joy and sadness and we are in on this to experience these feelings as well. Miyazaki never cheats the audience with pop culture references or token characters - there is warmth and touching humanity even in the most cunning personages. This is missing today in works by studios such as Disney where we expect characters to be immortal, even in the most violent sequences. Miyazaki borrows more from Russian animation - works like ""Hedgehog in the Fog"" and ""The Snow Queen"" - to make these characters absorbing and devoid of clichés.""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a film for all ages, moreso than his previous two efforts which seemed to cater to adults, I would say. This film's humour, I felt, was much sharper than in ""Spirited Away"", bringing back Miyazaki's patented light-hearted silliness of ""Porco Rosso"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"". I felt that I had to have been missing something in the character of Howl (as I saw the dubbed version into English) - he is serious, tragic yet also surprisingly goofy, especially in his obsession over his looks, specifically his hair. I am looking forward to seeing this with subtitles so I can admire the Japanese voicework to see if Christian Bale's dubbing was appropriate.I cannot recommend this masterpiece enough. If this is Miyazaki's swan song it could not be more appropriate.4/4"
leecmoyer,"Jun 15, 2005",8/10,"When's the last time you sat in the theater with a crowd of all ages and everyone had a good time? It happened to me today.I've read William Goldman talk about how the director gets too much credit for film, but there are certain directors whose work make his argument ring hollow. To see this movie directly after ROTS (Revenge of the Sith) is a particular treat - Miyazaki and his brilliant low-tech artisans bring more character, surprise, care and intensity to their work than George Lucas and his amazing high-tech staff ever could.A beautiful film that deserves all its good press. What a nice change..."
speedyspeaker,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"yes, yes, it was just too good! I absolutely loved it! You should see it! and its music...oh! too good to be true! I know this is all so quick but its all true! voices were terrific, too. My opinion, its probably better than Spirited Away.Diana Wynne Jones wrote the fantastic book, and Hayao Miyazaki made this incredible anime masterpiece cartoon. Its about a young woman named Sophie who is change by the Witch of Waste and turns into a 100 year-old woman. forced to leave her mother's hat shoppe, she sets out to find a cure or even find the Witch again to settle things back to normal. but along the way, meets the handsome but wicked Howl the wizard who is cursed by also an evil spell who also lives in a gigantic moving castle charged but the fire demon Calcifer. Not long, she is living & working with them but also getting involved with tough situations in their lives, especially with Howl's... but, in fact, Sophie is falling in love with him! so maybe Howl isn't so wicked after all. could love break both Sophie's & Howl's curse? could it just possibly stop the war Ingary, the land they live in, is having? well, you'll just have to watch it & find out! it may be confusing but, don't worry, I'll give you a quick spoiler: the story is a lot like world war II!anyway, I highly recommend you see this, for both children & adults!"
A_Boydude_Reviews,"Sep 15, 2018",8/10,"Hayao Miyazaki once again directs such a beautiful movie. Even though the enbglish voice cast did a decent job, I did prefer the japanese verion of the film. I felt that the acting was far better thatn the english. The plot was wonderful, but I did felt like the ending was abrupt and kind of cliche. But overall a fantastic movie that I 100% everyone of all ages to watch."
pixelberry,"Jun 30, 2005",10/10,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I went to see this movie, but I was really blown away by its amazing story. I had never heard of Diana Wynne Jones' books, so I knew almost nothing about the plot. The movie may be confusing at points, but I saw it several times and I think you have to watch it more than once to understand exactly what is going on. But, as usual, Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job with this movie, and it is well worth the price of a movie ticket.Some Miyazaki fans feel like this movie was a disappointment after the splendor of Spirited Away. But I heard Miyazaki say that Spirited Away would be his last movie because it was so wonderful, so I don't think his fans should expect Moving Castle to surpass Spirited Away in any form. The story lines are so different that you almost can't compare them at all. While Spirited Away is more elegant and Asian in its themes and its storyline, Moving Castle is a much more European. Because the story is so much more western, the music and scenery are very different from Spirited Away, which I think was very appropriate. Overall, I think the techniques Miyazaki used really fit the story well and that's why I gave this movie a 10 out of 10."
satoarchie,"Jun 29, 2005",10/10,"I was waiting and waiting for this movie to come out in US and finally did. I saw 4 times already, but try to go see it again. Because every time I watch this movie I find something new. It is like this movie have many layers and if you view this movie from different characters point of view, the story seems to offer something a bit different. (Sophie's point of view is the exactly the same as Howl, and if you watch the movie sympathizing to Sophie you will have a different perspective of the tale....it is not too easy to explain....but basically his characters have a life of its own and you can feel their emotions and reasons why they say or do things!) I think that is a magic of Miyazaki''s movie. He puts so much effort of developing the story line and it is not only one dimension, but all characters have their own. It may seem too much information and too rushing toward the end when I went to see it at first, but then once you (sort of) figure out the story, it is pretty natural that things happen that way. Like the world we live in all of us have different story to tell....His visual is simply stunning....it is amazing what he show us!All I can say is you should go to the theater to watch this movie to all people. It is worth watching it in the large screen!"
puddingishcool,"Feb 18, 2007",9/10,"'Howl's Moving Castle' is a masterpiece, a gem in Miyazaki Films. Of his films, I have seen My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away and this one, and to me, this stands out almost more than the others. A beautiful story of love and passion.The animation and twinge of magic fit the film perfectly, and a hint of wonder keeps viewers going. DO NOT read spoilers THEN watch this movie, and don't spoil it for your best friend: You have to start off with a clean slate to completely enjoy this magical film.I disagree that this film could have gotten any better than what it is now. I love every moment, dramatic, silly, or exciting, this movie pulled through. A great movie that you'd die to watch again and again.-Kuri-Chan"
stuartmay,"Mar 21, 2006",7/10,My first experience of Miyazaki's work was 'porco rosso / crimson pig' and I still consider that his best movie with Howl's Moving Castle running a some way behind.Howl's Moving Castle has an opening scene that reminded me of 'porco rosso' (namely the enthusiastic crowds cheering on the military parade). At this stage I was thinking that this would be a collage/mix of his other movies - and indeed most of the characters are drawn in similar style to the 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' movies.The plot is good as always (although primary credit must go to the original author). I find the worth of his movies to be in the plots and sub-plots that he puts into them. His movies seem to impart morality much more convincingly than anyone else (disney are you listening). And I agree totally with another reviewer when they said that Miyazaki can masterly blur lines between an enemy and a friend. This is what Disney should try and be like - kids are more sophisticated than we give them credit for and I think this movie can be appreciated by anyone over the age of 5.I like his level of animation detail too - I tried looking for flaws in the animation but I don't see them - even when someone slams a door in the background you can see things like dust and such moving - and this is just in the background. It's flawless anime.Anyone who doesn't like 'spirited away' or 'princess mononoke' movies will want to steer clear of this movie - but I found it to be a really good movie and the least you should do if you're a Miyazaki fan is rent it out and see it for yourself - maybe you'll end up buying it too :)
JamesFord92,"Jun 12, 2005",8/10,"I went to Howl's Moving Castle having been a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and was impressed. It was on par with his other movies, which are all equally great. The animation was stunning and the musical score was fantastic. Billy Crystal as the voice of the fire demon Calcifer annoyed me slightly, but other then that the the voices were great. The story could be confusing at times but was still good. The only really bad part for me was that the ending was sort of stupid. Other then that the movie was great, and had great animation. Howl's moving Castle is a good movie even compared to Miyazaki's other films such as Naussica and Spirited Away."
Thunderbuck,"Jul 15, 2007",9/10,"Miyazaki builds these wonderful little universes. Poetic, charming places that are at once familiar and exotic. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely bit of film that provides a great little escape.Miyazaki is clearly a master storyteller, because it's only after viewing this film that I realized there isn't really much ""story"" here, and what there is has many inconsistencies and unexplained twists. The ending, in particular, seems to just ""happen"". But, frankly, the characters are so involving, and the movie is so beautifully drawn, that any story shortcomings are easy to overlook.I know some are wary of the ""Disneyfication"" of films like this or SPIRITED AWAY. I think this is something of a labor of love, though, and is motivated less by greed than a sincere desire to bring these beautiful films to a wider audience. Certainly the talent isn't lacking in this English language translation, with great vocals from Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and the incomparable Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is quite funny as Calcifer, the fire demon, too.While I think I preferred SPIRITED AWAY on the whole, it's really just a few minor quibbles that lead me to this. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely place to visit for a couple of hours."
benjymouse53,"Jan 3, 2005",8/10,"To me, I think it is hard for children to understand the idea of this movie. I've never read the original, but other reviewer had mentioned this movie was not so much based on the original story. First, I would like to say that sound track of this movie was fantastic (His movie always has great sound-track). Second, I would like to say that I had a problem with voice. Sophie's voice was by C.Baisho. I think she's alright, when Sophie was old lady but when she was young girl her voice didn't meet the character (C.Baisho is I think in her late 50's or something like that). Over all, I enjoyed it very much. And I will watch few more times to understand his message. I didn't enjoy ""Sento-Chihiro no Kamikakushi"", but I think I liked this movie better in someways. Hopefully, he will produce more great movies in the future. I'm surprised to see that he didn't introduce great characters(Such as Totoro, Makkuro Kurosuke, Ji-Ji and etc).P.S. I think this movie, people will either LIKE it or DISLIKE it. Not for everybody I think."
knappster1111,"Jun 2, 2005",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle review:NOTE: (The version I saw was the original Japanese version with English subtitles) Howl's Moving Castle, I can already, say is front runner for best animated feature of the year. Miyazaki has done it again. The magic is still here. So far I've yet to see a bad Miyazaki film, which just shows that he is one of the most creative and inventive animators of all time. His works inspire and enthrall us.Not too long ago, he gave us his first big film, Castle in the Sky, a good film with wonderful animation. He followed up by the fun family film, My Neighbor Totoro, which was also good but not near as good as some seemed to think (ala Roger Ebert). He made other little hits here and there, but nothing compared to when he made his first big hit, Princess Mononoke, one of the best film's of '98. The animation was that much better than his previous films, and the story was a lot more involving than say ""Totoro's"". Following this, he created Spirited Away, a true masterpiece and definitely one of the bests films of 2002. A film that deservedly won best animated film at the Academy Awards. I think that Spirited Away may become a great classic someday in Anime history, as Snow White has done in Disney history. It had breathtaking visuals and an even more interesting (and totally bizarre) story than ""Mononoke"".While ""Spirited"" and ""Mononoke"" may be hard to top, Howl's Moving Castle sure comes close. Its visuals are stunning, the characters are just as ever entertaining, (I especially loved the character Calucifer, who is an ""evil"" made entirely out of fire; or there's turnip head who's a scarecrow with magic that makes him alive) and the story this time while mostly fantasy, actually has a more realistic side plot: The war. This adds some interesting twists to the story, and really makes it that more original than any of his other films. Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke may be impossible to beat, but Howl's Moving Castle can definitely stand on it's own.Miyazaki's films seem to have constant trends, similar characters, and sometimes identical story elements. But that is not to say that all his films are exactly alike. It is just interesting to watch and observe and realize that Miyazaki has made a world of his own and these films inhabit that world. Every time we see a Miyazaki film, we are seeing the world through his eyes. And, oh is it a wonderful place.You might notice a lot of characters that are alike in his films, especially his usage of young girls as main characters. And what would a Miyazaki film be without: strange, obscure oozing creatures, crazy old woman, and people who can transform into animals. And don't forget, what's a Miyazaki film without flying.These are all themes of Miyazaki. This is his style, and it may perhaps be the new Disney. While American hand-drawn cartoons are dying out, and computer animated cartoons are becoming the new trend, it's still good to know that we have Miyazaki films to look forward to the good, old-fashioned way."
Bunuel1976,"Mar 18, 2006",7/10,"Prior to this, I had only watched two of Miyazaki's celebrated animated features - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997) and SPIRITED AWAY (2001), though when I was in Hollywood recently I missed out on TCM's retrospective of his work - and, as with those films, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (which, incidentally, I had failed to catch on the big screen when it premiered during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, due to all the shows being sold-out!) is a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive - but what really holds the film together, for me, are the amiable anthropomorphic characters (Turnip the Scarecrow, Calcifer the Fire Demon and Heen the Dog) rather than the 'human' leads, the villains, or even the elements of fantasy so prevalent in this particular film-maker's admittedly unique brand of art."

AhmedSpielberg99,"Jul 26, 2019",7/10,"This is the only Miyazaki film I've seen so far that's what's on its surface is way, way less impressive than what's underneath it. Neither its fantastical story, its visual splendor, nor its understated yet funny humour hold a candle to its subtext. Howl's Moving Castle's weight lies on What's beyond its story. It's actually a meditation on age and love. Miyazaki allows you here to see the world through the eyes of an adult who longs to be young again while conveying a plethora of lessons by his visual storytelling, which is here at its finest regarding practicality, but this is not the case regarding creativity.The film also has tons of pacing issues, most noticeably in the first hurried 15 minutes and the rushed denouement. It also never fully settles into its storytelling technique. I wouldn't have minded the self-indulgent dreamy-like narration (well, not so much), nor this of the your typical sweet fairly tale one. But the mix of both made everything feels quite messy instead of flowing like a hallucinatory dream or an intriguing fantastical adventure story.Indeed, these issues had me confused a little bit. But the unprecedented practical visual storytelling I've mentioned above undeniably compensates for that. As the film proceeds, I find myself understand almost every obscure detail without being explained. That's mostly, if not entirely, due to Miyazaki's unmatched ability to tell a story relying on visual symbolism that remarkably keeps paying off till the last second.Overall, Howl's Moving Castle is the least Hayao Miyazaki film I've enjoyed so far. But that should by no means indicate that it isn't an exceptional work that's as light-hearted and delightful as it's though-provoking and heartwarming.(7.5/10)"
lunasolara,"Jun 2, 2005",10/10,"This a movie that anyone can enjoy, from your grandmother to grandkids, without being too fluffy. (There are plenty of explosions for those who need them. *laughs*) I saw this while in Japan on vacation and it was certainly worth the 1800 yen (about $18) I paid for the privilege. This is an adaption of the book by Diana Wynne Jones, so don't be surprised when you hear English names throughout. While I normally disapprove of overhauling a novel for the big screen, this is one occasion when it seriously needed it and it was masterfully done. Howl is a far more admirable character in the film than he was in the book and the movie moves along at a fair clip without ever getting bogged down. Sophie's many transformations from young to old to not so old to young and back again (many of them very short-lived) are wonderfully done and add a wonderful dimension to the story that I'm sure Ms. Jones would (and probably does) approve of. The book was perfect as a book, but the screenplay is perfect for the screen while retaining the essence of the book. I look forward to dragging my friends to the theater to see if the translators and English voice actors have done it justice."
arkif1,"Feb 24, 2007",10/10,"(German: Bravery and volition, do you own them? - Recruiting poster in Sophie's city)I had to watch this three times. The first time to memorise the different themes in this film, i.e. curses and preparation. The second time to really understand what all this is about. And the third time to become emotionally involved.""Spirited Away"" is by comparison pretty straight, this film is a little overcrowded. If this would be a Wagner opera, then it'd be ""Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg"". But I like this film more, it only shares its complexity and the corniness of its love theme with that opera. Speaking of music, that's quite a job on this one. From second Vienna school à la Berg over cosmopolitan à la Korngold to Vienna operetta à la Strauss, a fitting counterpart to the visual amalgamation of European architectures and machinery presented in this film.It's an indifferent could have been land, mixing German, French and English influences, located for most of its aspects around 1900. There is one major deviation from this setting, namely the battle ships, which are a clear WW II reference. In WW I it were the soldiers themselves who had to face the unspeakable, not the civilians.Now, the film is about love. It makes a vital point. That ""Mut und Willenskraft"" are necessary to steer your course in life, but that you are facing a double challenge, not only to be brave and determined, but also to use your virtue for the right purpose in a world that is specialised in harvesting inexperienced young men for any kind of purpose. It might be for sexual consumption, like the Witch of the Waste is doing it. Or it might be to channel their strength into inhumane efforts, like Lady Suliman does.The film tells in fact many such stories, stories about people that subscribed their force to aims that make them both unfree and inhumane. And it tells stories about the tasks those face who want to rise to the occasion of their own lives.It is a wonderful film. Poetical, rich, true. Perhaps too rich, you have to take some effort and time for it to work."
schuurmanark,"Mar 30, 2006",10/10,"This movie was a gift for my two children from and Aunt. I have watched it with them twice in the past few days. It is absolutely wonderfully captivating and romantic. I am a grown woman and I fell in love with the character of Howl. There is something about his voice that is every woman's dream---a man that will protect what he loves. Right away you view Sophi, a timid but kindhearted girl working in her family's hat shop, playing it safe and watching her mother hobnob with the rich crowd in town. Suddenly, you are bedazzled as she is swept off her feet by a handsome wizard who protects her from some would-be harmful men. Her life completely changes from there. This movie grabs you and pulls you in!---and I never thought I would be saying that about an anime. Mr. Miyazaki (Director) always seems to outdo himself! I definitely recommend this movie and Spirited Away, too, if you have never seen that."
Quentintarantado,"Apr 12, 2006",10/10,"I think many people are complaining about Miyazake because his movies are starting to look alike and their plots are beginning to get very similar. I don't have problems with that. The elderly Sofi here looks a little like Yubaba in Spirited Away and Dola in Castle in the Sky. However, you can generalize that all anime women look alike with their huge eyes and we can even go racist and say all black people look alike to Asians and Asians look alike to Americans and Mexicans, Spaniards and Argentinians look alike to Asians.Miyazake is animating and he's doing what he knows best. His Nausicaa looks like they borrowed clothes from his TV series, Conan, Boy of the Future (and his son's upcoming film, Gedo Senki, looks like they borrowed production and costume designs from Nausicaa). I look at it this way, they are riffs of the same theme, similar yet different, and each riff is a gift for humanity and I have no cause for complaint. Miyazake has white hair and I would want him to work on forever but I'm going to break my heart over him one day so I'm grateful for every film he makes. He will never do less than his best anyway.Despite this apology for his work (which does not need excuses anyway), Howl's Moving Castle has many virtues that makes it stand out from Miyazake's body of outstanding films. The movie has a tender eye for the elderly. It's a better version of the tale told in the Freaky Friday movies and 18 Again, because it's really told by an old man.And again, Miyazake repeats his refusal to make true villains out of his characters. A villain at the start will appear again in a wilted, helpless form, then still later as a supplicant, then finally as a friend.By the end of the film, Miyazake, that old master, has made me half in love with Sofi myself, whether she's the old lady with creaking bones, or the young girl with severe, conservative clothes, or the old lady with quick thinking and lightning reflexes or the young girl with hair like starlight, she's a complex creation, golden hearted yet not maudlin, plain in looks yet beautiful whether young or old."
moonstarly,"Jul 10, 2005",N/A,"I went into the theatre expecting great things from ""Howl's Moving Castle"" (the English title), being a Miyazaki fan to begin with, but this movie absolutely blew me away! The animation is, as usual, gorgeous; the landscapes are especially beautiful, and few films can compare to the detail of such intricacies as one finds on, say, the castle. But this movie is so much more than pretty graphics-- the plot is interesting, the characters are complex, and the message strikes at the heart of a lot of what is wrong with this world today. A great deal of it has to do with the evils of war, but I especially loved the messages about true beauty and love that this film had to offer. It's been a long time since I've been teary-eyed at the theatre ^.^ Miyazaki also does a great job with the balance between reality, fantasy, and sci-fi, which is always a true pleasure to watch. (I should also probably inform English-speaking fans that the English dub is superb, better by far than most of the abysmal anime dubbing I've heard) I would recommend this film to anyone, whether you're eight or eighty. The whole world deserves to know what an genius Hayao Miyazaki is!"
dwpollar,"Aug 23, 2009",7/10,"1st watched 7/26/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Hayao Miyazaki): Complicated and inventive fantasy from legendary Japanese animation director Miyazaki entertains the senses and the mind as well as the heart with this one. The story is about a moving castle lived in by a wizard called Howl as kind of a way of escaping from the responsibility of serving in a war he doesn't believe in. A young girl becomes attached to the character after a spell from a witch makes her old and she goes into the castle. These and other characters are very likable and include a mute scarecrow, a talking fire that moves the castle and more. The animation is wonderful even though sometimes the story is hard to follow. It's also a romantic movie about the young character and Howl, although this doesn't really kick in til' near the end. The female character teaches Howl eventually about not avoiding responsibilities and he learns to deeply care for her. All in all, a very complex story that really is fun also. A winner from this heralded Japanese director."
germangrrl,"Apr 9, 2006",10/10,"In the many years I have been watching Japanese animation (and all types of animation for that matter) I have never seen a film so engaging, so delightful and so thoroughly enchanting as 'Howl's Moving Castle'! I can only recommend this movie to young and old alike. Being a purist, I cannot watch it in the dubbed English version, but even in that form, it is a treasure! Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch all of his movies! While you're at it, watch all the Studio Ghibli movies! Whether you are a purist like me or a novice to Japanese animation, you will love these films! I can think of no better introduction to the world of Japanese animation than a movie from Studio Ghibli! Long live Miyazaki-sama and may he make many more such wonderful movies for his fans all over the world!"
moritzherz,"Jan 29, 2023",6/10,"Howls Moving Castle is a great anime that delivers with a heartwarming story suited for everyone yound and old.This movie is typical of the japanese anime films. Like spirited away it tells a heartwarming story with great characters. Some parts were a bit over the top, but thats also quite common in this genre.The animation is good, especially for 2004 this is high standard.You should watch this movie if you are interested in japanese animation. Also if you seek a heartwarming story this is your movie. It suits perfect for children, too.I give it a 6 out of 10 because I think it is a good movie definitely worth watching, but nothing that impressed me."
D_I_Sammi,"Jun 9, 2024",3/10,"Quite poorly told in a lot of areas, 'Howls Moving Castle' is not an anime for those expecting a good honest fantasy or Sci Fi. Many of the aspects of this fantasy is random, similar to stories by Terry Pratchett.The film's large error is that it doesn't set it rules out very clearly, and introduces characters that end up becoming so different from their initial first act that it derails the energy and enthusiasm.It's one of these animes that is niche for those 'in the know' behind what is supposed to be happening, but looking at the pretty picture in on itself from a blank canvas, it makes little sense and its world is almost incomprehensible."
derekcsea,"Mar 3, 2006",9/10,"Howl's Flying Castle has that unique Miyazaki flair (Spirited Away). The movie masterfully succeeds in achieving a balance between light fiction and deeper meaning exposition. Miyazaki paints an other-worldly environment filled with flying machines, monsters, princes, kings, and wizards, while maintaining subtle messages about freedom of the heart and persevering will.The movie at times almost seems stream of conscious. The plot meanders to introduce dynamic, colorful characters. However, the focus on the characters proves artistic and compelling; any tangents taken to introduce new characters breathes more life into a film that radiates with personality.Howle's flying Castle sparkles from the very beginning with beautiful animated scenes and colors intertwined with compelling and unique characters. However, the one weakness to the movie was the ending. It remained consistent to the simplistic charm of the movie, but almost too much so- the ending seemed like an understatement of the entire movie. Some cliché means were used to break the curses placed on the characters, but overall the beauty of the movie more than made up for a plain ending."
hays2,"Sep 21, 2005",10/10,"Like i said, ""It is so damn cute."" 10/10 Cute storyline. Cute castle. Cute little fireball. Somewhat cute old women. cute little kiss at the end. Cute colors. mean magic, and CUTE magic. pretty painting's that are cute. Sophie's cute. The whole movie is filled to the the max on cuteness, even the scary moments are cute, the way the characters smile......cute, the little dog that runs funny; is both very cute and funny. A matter of fact the movie is so cute that you just might be compelled to right a review explaining how cute the damn thing is. I love cute movies. The only movies that are cuter: wizard of oz, and the godfather- I think Italian people are just funny and cute."
cd105,"Feb 27, 2005",10/10,"this is the latest movie from Miyazaki. It's world is very thoughtful, colorful, and powerful. When you're watching it your brain will be working on this world. Powerful, because everything is moving, like How's castle: on this there are little thing you don't know what it is exactly but is moving your fantasy. The story is very good. A little girl (like in every Miyazaki movie) meet with Howl the young charming wizard. But Howl has enemies, so this little girl has turned into an 80 years old women because that meeting. Than Sophie go away from her home and got into Howl's castle. Howl doesn't realize that this women is Sophie, just few days later. Sophie will get in with Howl and his little friend. Than Sophie and Howl show you what the true friendship is. have a good time"
kumaresanvishnu,"Feb 21, 2021",10/10,There were certain scenes where I really felt I was there at the location. The film was very magical and had stunning animation and I really loved the story as well. The design of the location or the moving castle is fantastic...everything about this movie is phenomenal...a must watch for anyone.
imdb-10985,"Nov 30, 2005",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle was my favourite childhood book. I've read it many times (as an adult too). Diana Wynne Jones weaves the most creative, exciting, fun and magical stories around. I've been fairly annoyed with all the attention (+ movie spin-offs etc.) that JK Rowlings ""Harry Potter"" has received, since they are not, in my opinion, on par with Diana Wynne Jones' truly magical works.I had always wished that Howl's moving castle would be made into a film, but knew that it would probably be a disappointment. I've been proved wrong, Hayao Miyazaki is probably the only film-maker in the world with the fantastical vision required to bring this story to life.This is my favourite movie of the year, it has been a dream come true to see this most magical of stories told through Miyazaki's stunning imagery.My only concern with this is that many people seem to value watching it in the original Japanese with English-subtitles. I feel that this would probably be pretty confusing: an English story, translated to Japanese and then back into English! I've never heard of a translation of a translation that didn't get pretty confused. Besides, the English voice talents are world class, this is not a second-rate manga with a hammed up voice-over."
fophee,"Mar 19, 2005",10/10,"My family and I really enjoyed this movie. We saw it here in Japan last November, and today marks the movie's 121st day in release here (as of March 20). They are still advertising it here on TV, and along with the local and international release viewer numbers, the ads now include in big bold letters at the end the U.S. release date of June 10. Ghibli (Miyazaki) fans will of course enjoy this one, but I would recommend it for anyone. It has elements from virtually every movie Ghibli has done thus far, and fans will enjoy noting where they've seen certain themes and characters before. But it has certain qualities all its own. Fans of Diana Wynne Jones book will find that it takes a lot of liberties with the story. Not having read the book, I can't say too much on this, but I think those fans will still enjoy the movie a lot if they go in knowing that it is not a strict interpretation of the book."
BlueDragon,"Jun 12, 2005",9/10,"Yes, really - so many people seemed to love Spirited Away yet it didn't engage me whatsoever. However, I found Howls Moving Castle enchanting with some excellent characters and ideas - the animation is beautiful as is the scenery (some of it being classic Miyazaki, ie lush green landscapes, gently drifting clouds and the the sounds of nature).Without hesitation I'd put Howl above Princess Mononoke, although it's not quite as good as the superlative My Neighbour Totoro and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.Go see Howl - even if you don't like it as much as Miyazaki's other works then you'll certainly see something thought-provoking and imaginative."

There's no coherent plot, no real character development, an ending that brings in all kinds of new things, dramatic changes in characters' appearance and behavior for no reason (Sophie, the Witch of the Waste, etc.), and more ...or less.This is a pretty film with no substance whatsoever. I kind of feel like watching this film is like smoking a bowl, and not in the good way."
secret-violets,"Dec 22, 2006",10/10,"This is without doubt the best film I have ever seen! My friends are so great! First we saw Spirited Away which was ace, and that got me into these sorts of things. If you haven't seen it then watch it! It's great! The return of the Cat is also a favourite of mine, and as well as Spirited away and Howl's Moving Castle, is also made by Miyazaki. Check out as many films of his as you can because they are all really great! He's done loads so you'd have to work really hard to find them all. Anyway, back to the point. This is without a doubt the best film ever - I know I'm repeating myself, but I just can't say it enough. Thanks for reading my comment!"
benxrichardson,"Sep 2, 2021",9/10,"Howls Moving Castle is like nothing I've seen before. The animation was spectacular, the storyline was gripping and the character's were truly loveable.I wanted to give this movie a 10 but I felt the story became a bit lost about 3/4 of the way through, but it found itself in the end and left me feeling breathless. Bravo."
lmayer2,"Feb 20, 2007",10/10,"I've always enjoyed the Japanese art-like films. They're great to watch and they certainly are captivating. Howl's Moving Castle is a rare and special film. It teaches you life lessons, it has a phenomenal storyline and very little famous people, which adds a great tone to this film. I recommend Spirited Away if you personally enjoyed this one because you're sure to enjoy Spirited Away as well. I tend to look at Japanese films as art because they're so out of the ordinary (in a good way) and that's what truly makes them one of a kind. Japanese films are masterpiece and Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle is no different.A great film for anyone, imaginative. An excellent addition to any movie collection."
magongua,"Mar 3, 2018",10/10,"I have loved all the Hayao Miyazaki's movies I have seen. And this one is no exception. The characters are so compelling, even though the story is so fantastical, you can actually relate to them. The story is also beautiful and you can see the growth in the characters as is progresses. I do really recommend it to everyone who wants to experience something magical and amazing."

cinemapersonified,"Oct 13, 2024",7/10,"Rating - 7.7:
Overall, a pretty good movie that uses stunning Ghibli animation to create an allegory about the US invasion of Iraq, but the movie is held back by its ending being too safe and feel-good.Direction - Pretty Good:
The direction on a macroscale is very grand and beautiful as his signature style creates this stunning world; the direction on a microscale is fine, pretty typical to other Ghibli movies; the storytelling feels more linear thsi time around as there is a clear story arcStory - Good:
The concept is good as the movie is a allegory for the US invasion of Iraq, though it is a bit overt at times about it; the plot structure is laid out well as the movie is pretty linear; flow between sequences is; character writing is good as you do care for these characters and what they want, especially Sophie and HowlScreenplay - Pretty Good:
The dialogue is pretty good and standard, for English Dub; the humor keeps the movie pretty light-hearted; the symbolism is evident as the movie is a giant allegory for the US invasion of Iraw, even though it can be a bit overt at times; the foreshadowing is decently prevelantActing - Decent to Pretty Good:
Emily Mortimer - Pretty Good, Jean Simmons - Pretty Good, Christian Bale - Decent to Pretty Good (Holds his own as Howl, but feels like he has the same tone throughout the movie; shows glimpses as Batman), Lauren Bacall - Decent, Billy Crystal - Decent to Pretty Good (Mike Wazowski), Josh Hutcherson - Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the child role well), Rest of the cast - Decent (For English Dub; Typical background voice actors)Score - Great:
Helps make this movie feel very Ghibli and feel like an art-piece; great in its own-right outside of the filmEditing - Good:
Makes the movie feel polished and like an art-pieceSound - Pretty Good:
Typical Ghibli soundAnimation - Great:
The movie is visually stunning and shows why Miyazaki and Ghibli are key influences for bringing eastern animation to the western worldPacing - Pacing is pretty good for the most part, slows down a bit towards the endClimax - Climax is the best as it feels kinda forced to be feel-good, an issue I have with a lot of Ghibli moviesTone - Tone is very similiar to other Ghibli moviesFinal Notes - Watched English Dub."
grantss,"Mar 9, 2016",4/10,"Devoid of substance but kids should like it.A shy young woman, Sofi, is cursed by a bitter witch. As a result she becomes very old. She sets off in search of a means to break the curse. Soon she encounters a giant moving castle, owned by young man, Howl...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie. Intriguing set-up but the movie quickly degenerates into a rambling adventure for a plot with random action scenes and equally random solutions to problems, and no character depth or engagement. Howl's Moving Castle escalates into randomness sooner than most, making it even worse than normal.No real themes or profundities (par for the course, again). All this - rambling, random plot, lack of character depth, no profundities - make this unsuitable for intelligent adults. Kids should like it though."
crazieis,"Dec 31, 2005",9/10,"Enchanting! The more you watch it, the more you understand, as well as noticing the minor details you can't appreciate in the first viewing. It just made me feel strong, like I could accomplish great things. It gives you a warm sense of love and courage. I still don't understand why Sophie continually changes from old to young through out the movie...was it based on how other's saw her? I do wish I knew what happens after the end. Just amazing. The characters were unique, and Ghibli's movies manage to always have a more artistic and creative appeal than Disney(although i love Disney). I can't believe adults could conjure such beautiful imagination. The music is also perfect, it further enhances the mood."
hayahossam-61280,"Jun 3, 2021",10/10,This movie is 100% worth leaving a review. I could go on about how beautiful the storyline and the execution is forever. I watched this almost a year ago and i'm still as shocked by how amazing it was. If you haven't please please go watch it!! And listen to the soundtrack!! Merry go round of life is my absolute favorite movie soundtrack.
Jessicarosepb,"Aug 27, 2018",10/10,"I absolutely love this movie. While most of Miyazaki's movies have a pretty straight forward plot, Howl's Moving Castle will surprise. You will be entranced by the magical world and characters. In the beginning you think it all starts with a random encounter, but you soon realize that there is more to learn about the two main characters connection to each other. This movie is a true visual masterpiece. There is romance, comedy, and action.Because of the story that is told, Howl's Moving Castle is Miyazaki's best film. Spirited Away is just not a comparison because of the simple plot. If you have not seen Howl's Moving Castle, watch it."
Crap_Connoisseur,"Mar 26, 2006",N/A,"Howl's Moving Castle has everything that we've come to expect from Hayao Miyazaki - stunning animation, surrealistic touches and a whimsical storyline. Miyazaki has almost created his own genre, such is the distinctiveness of his work. Howl's Moving Castle is yet another example of why Miyazaki is in a league of his own.On the surface, Howl's Moving Castle appears to be a rather standard animated film for children, albeit with startlingly good production values. The storyline resembles a fairytale with Sophie, our hard working, plain Jane heroine being cursed by an evil witch. In fact, for the first 10 minutes of the film I feared that Miyazaki had lost his edge. My concerns were put to rest from the moment the witch of the waste's blob like henchmen emerge from the surrounding walls and chase Sophie and Howl through an alley. Miyazaki moves from Cinderella sweetness to Donnie Darko -esque weirdness in the blink of an eye without missing a beat.The weirdness continues as Sophie is transformed into an old woman and goes off in search of a wizard to help lift her curse. This results in Sophie moving into Howl's castle as his cleaning lady. There should be something seriously subversive about a love story between a young wizard, who really is a bird-like monster with feathers, and an old, hunchbacked woman but within Miyazaki's weird and wonderful world it appears perfectly normal. It is this underlying sense of the surreal that truly sets Miyazaki's work apart. Howl's Moving Castle offers strolls through the sky, alternate realities and a hero who occasionally melts into green sludge.Needless to say, the animation is breathtaking. The level of detail is astonishing and Miyazaki's sense for time and place is unrivalled. In comparison to this film, Pixar's computer animation feels cold and lifeless. Howl's Moving Castle is a work of art, while films like ""Robots"" and ""Madagascar"" are simply technically proficient. The animation is well matched by a memorable score and excellent voice work. Lauren Bacall stands out as the Witch of the Waste. If I have one complaint, it is with Billy Crystal being cast as Calcifer. His characterisation is a little too ""Dory"" for my liking. Unlike ""Finding Nemo"", this film did not require cheap comedic relief.By the film's conclusion, Miyazaki has succeeded in taking a fairytale and turning it inside out. Howl's Moving Castle is a magnificent achievement. It may not be quite as audacious as ""Spirited Away"" but in comparison to most children's films, it is positively twisted. Be a cool parent and hire this for your kid instead of dulling their senses with an artistic void like ""Chicken Little""."
Alice_Lu,"Apr 10, 2021",7/10,"One of the most confusing movies ever. From start to the end it was good in terms of effects and stuff but rather hard to follow in terms of story. I still did not fully understand what happened, but i am pretty sure you will not hate it even if you don't like it. 7/10."
jackthepgl,"Sep 1, 2023",10/10,"Along with Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, Howls Moving Castle is one of the fewer movies I've seen by Studio Ghibli so far and so far just when I was doing this review, I'm in complete awe with what I am seeing so far. So with that being said, Studio Ghibli is got to be one of the greatest companies of all time. Sophie voiced by Emily Mortimer, encounters a wizard named Howl voiced by Christian Bale, on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste voiced by Lauren Becall, who transforms her into an old woman. While trying to find a way to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside where she meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls him ""Turnip Head"". She enters Howl's moving castle where she meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer voiced by Billy Crystal, the source of the castle's magic and movement. When Howl appears, she announces that she has hired herself as a cleaning lady. After what I have witnessed as whole it is absolutely incredible along with the others. Yes, of course I go on and on about Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke but these are the movies I've seen and reviewed from Studio Ghibli so far. So much so that they both appear in the list of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die along with Grave of the Fireflies to be exact. But what I'm really gobsmacked about is why isn't Howl's Moving Castle on the list. I mean there's loads of movies that are on here that you and I have seen. I mean, come on, this film is unbelievably extraordinary. But what the hell, as it is a fantastic film it is an essential viewing for many people if they're fans of anime or anything themselves. I'm surprised to hear Christian Bale's voice in this which is surprising enough for me to find out that he starred in another animated film many, many years ago. Anyway, this is Howl's Moving Castle, a wonderful film with gorgeous animation, compelling story and great characters. This film has a lot going for even by it's time. I love Studio Ghibli. Did you know I'm utterly insane? (Chuckles) You get the picture."
SKallas,"Dec 10, 2005",7/10,"I think I am one of those stark staring mad Miyazaki lunatics who owns a copy of almost everything he has made... but for me this movie was a disappointment for various reasons that have been already said by many others here. Lack of new ideas (almost every trick, character, face, music passage not to mention a style) and on the other hand lots more of syrup and pathos instead of openness and sincerity. It felt more like a ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" than any of his previous masterpieces - though some have had hints of it here and there. Laputa comes to mind.Again, as others have mentioned, everything is relative. Regardless of its drawbacks, it is still Miyazaki with most of the greatness this inevitably implies. Disney still can't touch this and it still was great to watch.It's just... that I will still prefer to watch Totoro or Kiki or Spirited Away all over again instead of this one. These three are and will remain timeless classics for me I guess."
southdavid,"Sep 3, 2024",5/10,"Never let it be said that I'm not persistent. Historically, I haven't liked any of the Studio Ghibli films that I've seen, but as they are so beloved, I continue to assume that the problem must be me and give them another chance. Was ""Howl's Moving Castle"" the one to win me over? Spoiler alert - no, it wasn't.Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Jean Simmons) is cursed by the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) into the form of an elderly woman. Looking to break the curse, she moves into the castle of Howl (Christian Bale) a Wizard. The castle is both physically moving about the landscape and has magical doors linking it with the nearest large cities. Sophie's country is searching for a missing prince and engaging in a war with a neighbouring land. Suliman (Blythe Danner), the King's sorcerer, wants Howl to join the fight, he sends Sophie as his emissary to her but this has unforeseen consequences.Testament to my problems with this film, is how long it took me to try and put together that plot summation. I find if very hard to recall what happens in the film, even though I watched it less that three days ago. I remember it's themes, and those themes are noble; War is always bad and the elderly still have value - which is perhaps a more familiar concept to Eastern audiences than to Western ones. The plot of the film though struggled to maintain my interest, particularly once the set up was done.Within this criticism, I want to stress - as I always do when reviewing Miyazaki's work - that I appreciate that it looks amazing and that there's a monumental amount of work that goes into making it. I love the look of the castle, particularly it's movement, and the later flying vehicles. I've never really liked the character style of these film though and that continues here.So, this still wasn't the one to win me over to liking Ghibli films. I promise I'll keep trying through."
Missykender,"Mar 17, 2008",10/10,"I was flipping channels last night, and stumbled across ""Howl's Moving Castle"": The description said ""Anime"" so I flipped it on, and as I saw the first scene I originally recognized Miyazaki's/Stupdio Ghibli's unmistakable work, so I immediately hit the ""record"" button. I was disappointed that I'd missed about the first 20 minutes, but it didn't matter: The story immediately pulled me in, and as the story progressed, I was able to piece together what had gone before.Many other reviewers have written about the look and the content of the film, so I'll just note on how the movie made me FEEL: Howl's Moving Castle, like all the rest of Miyazaki's films, alternately evoked feelings of awe (I mean, the mouth hanging-open type), wonder, sorrow, and indescribable joy: His works are as much a labor of love as Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Even in the English version, the depths of warmth and respect for this work shine through on the part of the actors. Stellar!"
bonnie-37350,"Mar 14, 2018",10/10,"It's directed by Hayao Miyazaki. every scene of his directed movie is magical, he is a artist, a wonderful artist.

ChicagoBoy,"Jun 11, 2005",N/A,"Hayao Miyazaki does not disappoint us with this visual masterpiece. Howl's Moving Castle is both an opulent feast for the eyes as well as a cleansing tale of good vs evil for the soul. But unlike in JRR Tolkien, where the line between good and bad is thick and easy to discern, in Howl's Moving Castle the good hearted characters can be threatening demons and the forces of ill will can be sympathetic figures of love and woe. It is distinctly non-Christian at it's core. I found this refreshing and frankly more like the inner workings of my own self, where the hero within must find the good and accept the bad in the same grasp. As far as art goes the film is stunning. I missed Miyazaki's wonderful relationship with food that was in Spirited Away (I loved how every character in that film was moved by tiny plates and giant piles of odd looking treats). This was missing in Howl's Moving Castle, replaced more by an obsession with architecture. But Miyazaki's brilliant mix of crumbling rot and bloom flowers was all there. Gorgeous vistas and quaint villages blend together with filth and decay so that they are all beautiful (as does good and evil blend so they are all as they should be). This is not my favorite of his films but it is an absolute must see for anyone who loves moving paintings and fairy tales bordering on the surreal."
maguipen,"Sep 1, 2005",7/10,"I'm not a good fan of anime. Like the fantasy, the background, but don't like too much the style of characters. Miyazaki is one of the best of genre, so it's difficult not to like this movie.Sophie is an ordinary teen with no self steam. Meets Howl, the hero, the wizard, the handsome man. Jealous, a witch turns Sophie to an old lady. The story continues through magic kingdoms, goddess, demons and wars.Like a fairy tale, Miyazaki criticizes war, jealousy, vanity, but storyboard could be better. Animation is great, with a huge living castle moving thousand parts at the same time. Kind of bizarre, but really good.Humor is everywhere. Isolated and adult, but the best comes with Calcifer, a simple demon. The fire of the castle. Simple, but funny.Worthy, even if you're not an anime addict."
marijojo94,"Feb 9, 2007",10/10,"I love this movie. It really rocks. I love all the Hayao Miyazaki movies, specially this one.If you like magic and really amazing stories you should see it. It is about a woman that is cursed by a wicked witch. She turns into an old lady. I don't want to say anything more because I want it to be a surprise.Im sure you will like it. Its one of my favorite movies .I also recommend you to see Porco Rosso, Spirited away and Mononoke princess, all of them are Hayao Miyazaki's films.Enjoy!!!"

SerghieAndrei,"Jul 11, 2017",10/10,"This is one of the best animation that I have ever seen. Of course, the other ones are also directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I was tired to watch animations with the same plot and the same action, until I found this one. This is a masterpiece. The script is original and the story is one of a kind. I can watch this one over and over again."
masonsaul,"Sep 16, 2023",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is a film full of genuine magic and wonder. A fairytale adventure all the way down to the curses and true love's kiss with plenty of mature themes. Exploring how beauty is often viewed and the futility of war through a constantly growing unconventional family.Chieko Baisho starts off in wide eyed, unsure fashion as the way into this world and then becomes more confident as it goes along. Takuya Kimura has an instant charm as Howl, designed to win you over straight away but beneath all that is a lot of fear and anxieties which is what makes his performance really shine.Hayao Miyazaki's direction is just phenomenal, the film is jaw droppingly stunning from the very start and with magic at its centre it does some wildly inventive things throughout. Joe Hisaishi's score is present in almost every scene and it's a testament to his beautiful work that its constant presence is a huge positive."
vertigo_14,"Jul 10, 2005",8/10,"'Howls Moving Castle' is one of my favorite animated feature films. I wasn't as impressed with Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and have yet to see any of his other feature films. But this one, however, has great characters, a sense of humor, a unique plot, and would have been perfect in my book had it not been for a the sappy ending in which everything is easily and predictability resolved Walt Disney style. This being the same unfortunate state that marred another one of my favorites, Garden State.'Howl's Moving Castle' refers to just that, a floating contraption which looks like an island conglomeration of houses and trees which move around on robotic legs and emit plenty of pollution. Our main character is not actually Howl, but a young girl who befriends Howl, but through a curse, is turned into an old woman. Trying to figure out how to restore herself, she finds work in the Moving Castle as a maid where she befriends it's few residents--a young boy, a ball of fire (or rather, the igniting soul of a fire, and the mysterious Howl. In the meantime, she likewise becomes involved with Howl's participation in an ongoing war. The plot by this point becomes slightly complicated to explain without giving too much away only because several other characters enter the story, imposing a few more subplots.The beauty of this film is, unlike other animated features, not wonderful by any means for the animated style. For the most part, if you've seen one Japanimated cartoon these days, you've seen them all in their inglorious, standardized form. And perhaps, this is where Hayao Miyazaki and his film-making team should experiment with new styles and approaches. Instead, the beauty of the film, at least for me, is largely due to such a unique and engaging story. I am normally not a fan of this genre, but I really enjoyed this particular one."
wslm55,"Aug 8, 2005",8/10,"Alright, I'm not gonna lie to you. HMC is flawed. Then again, what isn't?The very best thing about this movie is that you actually care about the characters.I often end up half-rooting for the villains in most movies, but not here. Miyzaki, has created such deep and lovable characters(especially Calcifer) that every little problem they faced had me doubled up in worry.The story is interesting too, though a little lacking. The cities are on the brink of war, due to foolishness and random gobbledy-gook that i didn't understand.And here's where Miyazaki goofed up. While he should have made the entire war drama more, well, dramatic, he instead replaced it with cleverness. We get a serious scene that could have easily escalated into something more profound and moving with Miyazaki's talents, but rarely does. Many of the scenes (especially the ending) feel like they should end with an earth shattering bang. Instead they all end abruptly, leaving us scratching our heads and wondering what the hell was the point Miyazaki was trying to make.Of course, Miyazaki has to be aware of his target audience, which unfortunately includes the little ones, so I can't really blame him for not going further. I would have preferred it if he went for the profound rather than the clever, but hey that's life. This is STILL a great film that everyone should see. 8/10, maybe 8.5/10"
azenyaan,"Sep 23, 2021",7/10,"It's good, with good and soothing musical instruments to listen to. Unfortunately, my imagination has not been able to understand what Miyazaki meant in the film."
stakespike,"Nov 16, 2005",10/10,"The thing with a Miyazaki film is you don't simply watch the film, you step both feet first into his world, invest your heart and soul into the story unravelling in front of you piece by beautifully animated piece. you develop feelings for every one of his detailed, vibrant characters from the films swashbuckling hero to the tiniest of creatures and revel in the quaint and often logically challenging events that these characters go through . 'howl's moving castle' is no different to any other Miyazaki outing.One major difference the film has compared to both 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' is its slightly westernised setting, this is clear from the very first few shots central characters home town. The film focuses around a rather dreary, old before her time hat maker named Sophie, the eldest of what appears to be a rather large family of daughters she feels the heavy burden of being the eldest and carrying on the family business of making hats. Its not until a brief encounter with the mysterious and handsome sorcerer howl that you really begin to see the Miyazaki magic beginning to weave its web and my oh my what a web, shortly after her meeting with the enchanting, romanticized magician she comes into contact with another magically inclined being whose traits couldn't be further from howl's, she is the legendarily sinister witch of the waste, a rather large, grotesque and somewhat generously proportioned hag ( I mean to say she's rather fat). She is as ugly as she is powerful, as Sophie soon finds out when the insanely jealous witch places a curse on her as a result of her encounter with the elusive howl , Turning Sophie from a frumpily garbed yet captivating beautiful young woman into a time ravaged, grey haired old lady, as if that wasn't enough the witch reveals one final but sinister twist in Sophie's curse "" The best part about that spell, is that you can't tell anyone about it"" she chortles as she leaves Sophie reeling in despair and its here Miyazaki's tale really takes off, without revealing too much (more that is) Sophie heads off to the wastelands, a place teaming with the magically inclined and stumbles upon howls moving castle as well as a host of other equally endearing friends, including turnip head a rather tatter some scarecrow with a secret , the disgruntled but often hilarious Calcifer the fire demon and the imp like Markl a young apprentice of howl's. The film offers a sentimental, heart warming tale of a band of misfits who were lost within the realms of normality finding a place (and a family) somewhere they least expected to, inside howls moving castle. The film has major helpings of tyranny, war, love, hate and of course the oh so relevant subliminal messages all Miyazaki's lovingly crafted masterpieces contain. Stunning visuals, engrossing storyline and the deliciously dreamy score make howls moving castle a cut above the recent batch in computer generated animations which lack both the character and charm howls moving castle so poetically portrays putting it on par if not above its Miyazaki predecessors."
thebalmyone,"Jun 5, 2006",7/10,"After seeing Spirited Away and loving it, I couldn't wait for the newest animation movie to come out from Studio Ghibli. This movie also happened to be a animated version of my favorite book, Howl's Moving Castle. After seeing the movie, I loved the animation and music score, and the plot was very interesting, if confusing at times. The thing that took me by surprise is that the plot line is so different. Some names are changed, and one of Sophie's sisters doesn't even exist! I know those are small things, but there are many other, more major, details that have been changed beyond recognition. However, if you have not read the book but wish to see the movie, then you will enjoy the movie. Just be prepared for a surprise when you read the book and compare the two!"
Murray_Sometimes,"Oct 11, 2015",3/10,"There is a lot of very high praise being thrown about in these reviews, which I can only imagine is coming from Miyazaki fans who automatically love anything that he does. Because while this animated feature is an admirable piece of visual art, it lacks any other redeemable traits.The plot is nonsensical and full of loose ends (and loose beginnings). The characters behave in frustratingly random and unexplained ways. The core plot points are half-baked. And the ending is truly terrible. As I neared the end of this overly long story, I was just wishing it would be over already, and when the end did come, it seemed as though the director was in just as much of a hurry for it to end as I was. The ending felt rushed and corny, with a good dose of deus ex machina which still failed to bring sense to the plot.Read the book - it's pretty good. But give this movie a miss."
HUSAIN_INFJ,"Jun 20, 2021",8/10,"I'm new to writing reviews, but I'll try to clarify things .This movie is completely unusual. The movie had its charming, beautiful, distinctive and unfamiliar world. Its entertaining,
cute, and distinctive characters were written in a very wonderful way. , The essence of the film was very beautiful, the music as such is beautiful and touches the heart, comic scenes that make you cry with laughter, and human situations that teach you a lot about life , Even if you do not fully understand the story or become strange to you, of course you will enjoy the adventure with the film and the elaborate and wonderful drawing."
Zlatikevichius,"Jan 26, 2021",9/10,Miyazaki is the kid that never grew up! His imagination is a miracle. And his heart is like a Howl's heart - always young. I now know that Peter Pan is actually Japanese.
cherold,"Jul 19, 2005",8/10,"After Spirited Away I was very anxious to see Miyazaki's new movie, and I was not disappointed. Once again he has made a magical, lyrical work of art and entertainment. This movie makes me think of the Wizard of Oz, not for the story but just for the way in which everything is touched by magic. Everything is created by magic or cursed by magic so you just have to call the film magical. Characters are well drawn and the movie is very funny but with a thoughtful, melancholy quality that comes out now and again.Unfortunately, Miyazaki was little sloppy in terms of story. At the end of the movie, neither I nor my girlfriend understood what it was that happened to howl or what Madam Suliman's agenda was. The rumors about Howl are mentioned then dropped and there's a plot development at the end for which no groundwork has been laid at all.But Howl's Moving Castle is ultimately so engaging and directed with such assuredness that one can forgive its flaws."
Edu-16,"May 20, 2006",N/A,"Thanks in part to the equally wonderful 'Triplets of Bellevue' - the family have recently discovered that there is a whole world out there of imaginative and beatuiful animated film making. We've seen quite a number lately from Hayao Miyazaki and others - but to my mind this is our favourite so far.The story is of a plain girl who is turned into an old maid by a witch who is in turn in love with a wizard called Howl. The girl goes to work for Howl in his 'moving castle' as a cleaning lady and meets and befriends various characters during her adventures. Her relationship develops with Howl against a backdrop of a futile war and her struggle to find her youth once more.There is so much visual imagination in this film that you find yourself hitting 'pause' a lot to take the scenery in. It deserves the time. Some vistas are barely on screen for more than a second - but will take your breath away.The voice overs are well done - but I particularly liked Lauren Bacall as the witch of the waste. The music is equally stunning - with a main theme you never tire of. All in all - superb.PS. If you liked this - then you should also check out 'Whisper of the Heart', and 'Laputa'."
yiannos_p,"Sep 19, 2005",7/10,"One thing that will always be evident in any Miyazaki film is the director's imagination. The worlds he creates are incredibly characteristic. However, up until Princes Mononoke, these worlds were also accompanied by a solid story, which allowed the director to express himself and at the same time made sure the audience was not confused and the theme of the movies was delivered withing their time frame.Howl's Moving Castle and in my opinion Spirited Away move on a basic story thread and theme, but the individual actions of the characters are sometimes unexplainable and impolitic. In Princess Mononoke, in every action we could see the motive. This is not always the case here.Besides that, this movies reminds us a lot of Miyazaki's previous works, like Laputa. As a result, this world does not seem as impressive as the ones we've been used to so far.What gave me the worst impression was the ending. To me it was so over the top that it made one forget the rest of the movie and the other themes just to focus on the relationship between Howl and Sophie.In the end, how bad can a Miyazaki movie get? At worst, it will be simply quite good and that's what Howl's Moving Castle is. I could not use a negative word for a Miyazaki film, so let's not say that it is his worst, but it is definitely the least good."
paulclaassen,"Oct 6, 2019",7/10,"'Howl's Moving Castle' is a very imaginative and unusual story. With magic, wizards and witches abound, this is an interesting and exciting fantasy adventure.The film is about several cursed people who desire a spell to be broken. Despite being cursed, Sophie continues to see the beauty in everyone and everything, and she is guaranteed to steel your heart for being such a good Samaritan. 'Howl's Moving Castle' is so much more than just an animated film. It sends out a powerful message of acceptance, and believing in yourself. It also illustrates how inner beauty is far more important than outer beauty.Through a series of weird and wonderful moments, with great animation, the film delves deep into the abyss of self-discovery and humanitarianism."
toll-8,"May 4, 2012",4/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a well know Japanese director for producing some of the best 2D animation films since the old school Disney ones. His vision is always extraordinary and inventive, and this trademark is continued in Howl's Moving Castle. Unfortunately though it is not as good as his previous film Spirited Away, which is a lot better. This could be because at least Spirited Away had a story that you can grasp onto. Howl's Moving Castle doesn't have much of a plot to really hook you in, and I found myself floating in and out of the film due to this problem.The story follows a young girl called Sophie, who is rescued by some obnoxious guards by the notorious wizard Howl (Bale). This moment is watched by the Witch of the Waste (Bascall) who, when Sophie is alone, casts a spell on her out of jealousy, turning Sophie into an old woman. After this change Sophie, who is now known as Grandma Sophie (Simmons), heads up the mountain in search of Howl, in the hope that he can reverse the spell. When she finds his home, which is a giant misshaped castle made out of unshaped metal pieces on legs, she enters it to find a young wizard learning from Howl, and a talking fire call Calcifer. When Howl returns to his home she tells him she is the new housekeeper, and decides to befriend Howl before asking for his help. Whilst she cleans for him she mixes up his box of magic, causing him to lose his power. At this Sophie must go and visit his former mentor, Madame Suliman (Danner), to gain back his power and this visit causes the Madame into uproar and she declares war between two worlds, with Howl seeming to be one of the only ones who can defend it. From here the truth about Howl's magic powers come to the surface, and we find out that he may not be all that he seems. Will Sophie be able to ever go back to her former self?The synopsis above is rather vague as the story of Howl's Moving Castle is also very vague. It is slightly difficult to follow and doesn't really make much sense. These animated Japanese films, directed by Miyazaki, are often about magic, potions, and objects that are not of this world, but usually we can buy into them easier then what this film allows us to. The characters aren't as well developed as well as they are in Spirited Away and this helps less in enjoying the story.Half of this problem though could be down to me. This sort of film isn't particularly to my liking, Spirited Away was a slight exception, and due to this I find my mind wandering throughout and not really concentrating on the film. Reading other opinions on the film, I do see that I am not the only one who struggled to really grasp the plot, but I do seem to be the only one that isn't a huge fan of these movies. They can be good just this one wasn't particularly.I watched the English version of this film, which is why I have credited English actors above. I have been told that the Japanese speaking version is better as some of the dialogue is lost in translation and the Japanese voices are much more enthusiastic. The voices in English are typical of the actor and little emotion seems to be involved, that is other than Billy Crystal as Calcifer who steals the show. Christian Bale doesn't strain his voice, and is so much like him that the minute he spoke I knew it was someone I had heard before. It took me a few minutes to realise and again this was a few minutes that I spent not really indulging in the film. I do prefer a good animation when the voices aren't obvious of the actor.All in all it isn't the best Japanese animated film. Some of the imagery is beautiful and the moving castle is very imaginative indeed. However this is nowhere near as good as Spirited Away and if you feel the need to watch a Japanese animated movie, I suggest you rent that instead.2 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

jose-cruz53,"Nov 16, 2012",9/10,"This film has perhaps the highest animation quality ever. It is truly stupendous: the mountains and skies are painted with such a beauty that it makes it appear really stupid that some film studios are making animated films in CGI, which looks like plastic dolls. This, on the other hand, is real art and it looks stupendous.The film doesn't have a well defined story, instead, it is quite an art- house film that doesn't follow the Hollywood conventions but at the same time it was a quite popular film in Japan, becoming the third highest grossing film in Japanese history after Titanic and Spirited Away (indeed, Avatar's gross in 2009 wasn't high enough to surpass this film).This combination of artistic value with entertainment value is what makes Miyazaki's film so special."

shaylarowlings,"Jun 18, 2022",9/10,"In Howls moving castle, Hayao Miyazaki flips his own script and turns a coming off age story into a film where people should have come of age but didn't. Howl, Sophie, Markl, Calcifer, are people who don't want to take responsibility for where they are in their life, and don't want to move on. The great thing about this film is that all they layers to the film are neatly wrapped up in strong character-based storytelling which remains the core of the film. Sophie has a lovely outlook on life at the beginning of the film. She doesn't want to live her life in the back room making hats, but 'it's still better in here than out there'. So when Sophie gets her 'curse' it's actually great for her. She's really quick to embrace it because it means that she can skip this adulting thing entirely and go straight into old age. The point that the film makes is that while all adults are horrible in their own special way, all these coping mechanisms to avoid becoming and adult do not work. This resolution comes when the characters can learn to define for themselves what adulthood is."
jamesrupert2014,"Jan 8, 2021",9/10,"The obese and malevolent 'Witch of the Wastelands' (Lauren Bacall*) transforms Sophie, a young girl (Emily Mortimer*) into an elderly women (Jean Simmons*). Hoping to reverse the curse, Sophie searches out Lord Howl (Christian Bale*), a youthful but powerful sorcerer who lives in the titular castle with his assistant (Josh Hutcherson*) and Calcifer, a captured fire-demon (Billy Crystal*) who maintains the strangely anthropomorphic ambulatory fortress. The imagery, a blend of high-fantasy and steam-punk, is striking and imaginative and, the characters are nicely done (with A-list voice talent), and like most Studio Ghibli films, the backgrounds are detailed and the palatte lush. While the film is clearly a paean to pacifism (as director Hayao Miyazaki intended), the message does not overwhelm the film, which is amusing and entertaining. As others have noted, Howl, ostensibly the hero of the story, is somewhat morally ambiguous but Sophie (both young and old) is resourceful, resilient (she is very philosophical about having her youth and beauty stolen) and compassionate (as she cares for the witch, who has had her power stripped away). Marvelous. *voice in the English version"
StanleyStrangelove,"Sep 13, 2005",N/A,An 18 year old Sophie is turned into an old woman who cannot talk by the Witch of the Waste. Sophie leaves her home and finds the moving castle of Howl a wizard. She gets inside and meets Calcifer a fire demon who powers the castle. Calcifer agrees to help her if she will help him get free of Howl. Sophie and Howl fall in love.It's hard to describe this animated film. It's mysterious. You can never really get your bearings with this movie. The moving castle is an amazing invention. It's completely unlike American animated Disney films. The director/animator Hayao Miyazaki is considered a Japanese master and his films are so highly regarded the Disney company is involved in getting them released in the West.The plot is a curious blend of fantasy and reality. There is definitely a strong anti-war message in the film.Hayao Miyazaki also did the recent Spirited Away which was released a few years ago in the US.
drqshadow-reviews,"Jul 20, 2020",7/10,"A relatively obscure Welsh fantasy novel provides the material for this, Miyazaki's follow-up to Spirited Away. It's a lovely marriage; two visions meant for one another. Howl's land of witches and wizards, steam-powered societies and shadowy machinations, calls back to several preceding chapters in the Studio Ghibli catalog, while still standing firm as its own original story.The first hour is particularly good, setting the stage with the director's usual doses of playful imagination and enchanting personality. We've got magic doorways, talking flames, witches' curses, fantastic flying machines, ticker-tape military parades and, of course, gigantic palaces propelled by mechanical chicken legs. Ghibli always profits from these long establishing shots, having mastered the art of breathing life into a world and watching it blossom, and the opening act is stuffed with so much of it that I couldn't have wiped the smile from my lips if I'd tried.It falls into a bit of a rut after that, struggling to stretch an airy premise into something larger and more meaningful. There's depth to the story, but much of it remains unrevealed as the plot meanders and stumbles its way to a hazy finale. The animation is great, as expected, with colorful characters and alluring scenarios to spare, but Howl grows lost after that initial sheen wears off."
QAlpha007,"Sep 6, 2024",8/10,"""Howl's Moving Castle"" truly feels like a whimsical fever dream crafted by Miyazaki's spellbinding imagination. From the very first frame, the visual beauty is so overwhelming, you almost forget that the plot occasionally feels like it was stitched together by Calcifer in a hurry. The moving castle itself is a character, lumbering along like an overworked kitchen appliance trying to avoid a breakdown.Sophie's transformation into an old woman is both touching and amusing (honestly, she handles aging better than most people handle Monday mornings), and Howl... well, let's just say, being a ""mysterious and dashing wizard"" sometimes translates to ""dramatic man-child with impeccable hair."" Calcifer, the snarky fire demon, steals the show-someone give that flame a sitcom already!The story dances through themes of war, love, and finding beauty in the chaotic. But, and it's a big but, the plot occasionally wanders off like the castle itself, leaving you scratching your head in delightful confusion. Despite the bewildering narrative, it's a movie worth watching again-if only to lose yourself in the breathtaking animation, Miyazaki's magic, and the bizarrely charming world of Howl.A visually captivating film with a story that's sometimes as hard to follow as Howl's emotions."
KiroiSenko13,"Jul 29, 2025",7/10,"Similar to other Miyazaki works Howl's Moving Castle is beautifully made. The animation, the world building, the music are all top notch with great attention to detail. Dream like fantasy is how I would call it briefly. Nevertheless, in contrast with Princess Mononoke which is his best work in my view, the plot of this movie is a disaster. I read that the plot it is different from that of the original novel and maybe that it is why. There is no real character development, no clear motives behind the characters actions and very few things seem to fit in place. Many things are completely unexplained and hard to follow. Therefore, despite the superb production the movie got boring after a while."
dcr-design,"Feb 22, 2006",9/10,"I didn't see the subtitled version that the reviewer did but the dubbed version was completely cohesive and made sense both to me and my 10 year old nephew. The dubbing was excellent and the US casting blended beautifully with the gorgeous animation. I enjoyed it every bit as much as Miyazaki's other films, with the same brilliant dream world slight-of-hand that surprises you at every turn. Miyazaki has affection for even his most selfish characters, setting him apart from other animated features which still insist that all characters are either good or evil. It's important for young audiences to learn that bad actions aren't motivated by evil but by real human needs and emotions. If there is one message that needs to be shared in our world today, this is it."
skyisthelimit925,"Oct 14, 2021",8/10,"There's something unique in each movie that came out from Studio Ghibli and Howl's Moving Castle is definitely one of them with its charming atmosphere and lovely story. It makes you feel as you're stepping into a whole another world. The elements in the movie are so different that you could only imagine them, but somehow Miyazaki manages to make them real.Even though love cannot be defined by simple words, our best bet of understanding it is by feeling it. Sometimes we feel a weird weight on our chest, as Howl says. And it's usually the heavy burden of heart, as answered by Sophie. Holding onto our loved ones makes us vulnerable in a way that when they're hurt, it brings an unbearable sadness to us. In any case, they're the ones that adds a meaning to our lives; and Howl's Moving Castle is an exceptional movie in telling this fact."
theantimonyelement,"Jul 6, 2008",10/10,"Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent book by Diana Wynne Jones. It is an even better movie by Hayao Miyazaki.This film adaptation of a novel is one of the very few that I've found that actually IMPROVES itself by changing the plot of the book. Roughly the first third of the movie follows the pattern of the novel: a girl named Sophie is transformed into an old woman and must seek out the mysterious wizard Howl in the hopes of changing back. From there, however, the basic structure and purpose of the story are altered to fit Miyazaki's unique style--and it works wonderfully. The movie retains the same humor and heart that makes the book such a delightful read; and does it on its own, without bothering to align the tiny details. In the hands of anyone else, I would have been woefully depressed by the result; however, Studio Ghibli succeeds masterfully in creating a meaningful and deeply fun story that is enjoyable for every age. The art is whimsical and bright, the plot is coherent, and the characters are dimensional and interesting. I'm not a fan of anime in general, but even I can enjoy the liveliness of this delightful movie.So read Diana Wynne Jones' book for a great story. Watch this movie for a completely different one. But be prepared to enjoy yourself either way."

The plot is well written but not simple so it may be difficult to follow at times. But Hayao Miyazaki has real talent that no one can deny.

mackiepg,"Mar 18, 2006",4/10,"I love Miyazaki's movies. In fact, I have seen most of his movies.However, after watching ""Howl's moving Castle"" I was very disappointed. I thought that Miyazaki killed the book ""Howl's moving castle"" by making this terrible adaptation. Did Miyazaki understand the book when he read it? He simplified the story so much, and yet he made it somewhat confusing because there wasn't any explanation to why things happened in the film.I wonder if any of the people that think the movie is so good has read the book.First: The most pointless part of the film is the war.Second: The film didn't explain why Sophie was cursed in the first place. There was no explanation for the pointless war either. It seemed that the story was floating around. The plot was not well developed.Third: They changed all the characters, and their personalities.Fourth: There were a lot of clichéd things. Miyazaki preferred to replace parts of the book that showed originality with clichéd scenes that can happen in any fantasy story.For example: Sophie going to Howl's childhood telling him to meet her in the future. (time travel) Example 2: Sophie kisses the scarecrow, and the scarecrow becomes a human because of the kiss from his true love(Sophie).If you thought this movie is good, you should read the book. After you read it, you might hate the movie. The book is funny, original, and full of magic. It can't be compared to the movie."
Long_Liv102807,"Jun 8, 2023",10/10,"The film is perfect just like Ponyo, Spirited away, and all the other Studio Ghibli films I've watched. I love Calcifer and his iconic quote ""May all your bacon burn!"" My friends introduced Howls Moving Castle to me for my 13th birthday when I was at a sleepover at their house. They're twins and one of them was doing my makeup and it was a fun time watching! One of them as well also showed me Ponyo when I told them I saw Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service. All of Studio Ghibli's movies are so exciting to watch and I cannot get enough of them! It's amazing and I hope they make more gems like these in the future."
spinzin,"Apr 26, 2008",10/10,"I wasn't too keen on watching this movie. I happened to be a major Christian Bale fan and I was searching for any movie of his that I hadn't seen. And, I found this. I was thinking, uh, its just his voice, how great can it be. But then, I had no other option! So I rented this to watch it and I was so impressed. Witty humor, excellent animation, wonderful music, and a spectacular story. What an imagination! From the mysteriousness of the wizard Howl to the breathtakingly bizarre moving castle of his, it was brilliant. Mayazaki truly is a genius. I would say, it is the Japanese Harry Potter. A MUST WATCH. I wished I hadn't missed it in the theater! hmph!"
ccto,"Apr 2, 2006",8/10,"As soon as I saw the preview artwork for the titular castle, I knew I just had to see this film in the cinema rather than DVD. Personally, I think the castle ranks as one of cinema's most incredible visual creations - a lumbering, wheezing mechanical colossus that rumbles along the countryside. Characters in the film stop to stare when it passes, and you too will be taken in by its awkward majesty.Like a lot of other people, I am a Miyazaki fan and I must agree this is not his best work. But when your body of work is as accomplished as his, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, I would still say Howl's Moving Castle was my favourite film that year.I agree with those who say watch it in its original Japanese soundtrack. Yes, the American actors do their best, and it's not a bad cast, but there is something quintisentially Japanese about all of Miyazaki's films, and these subtle nuances are inevitably lost in translation. No fault of the English-speaking actors or Lasseter himself who supervised the dub, that's just the way it is.So to calibrate your expectations - it's not as good as Spirited Away, but it does have that Miyazaki magic, and that's all the reason you really need to go see it."
terrj-07720,"Jun 23, 2021",9/10,"Unsurprisingly, Studio Ghibli has done it again. Loosely based on the novel of the same name (written by Dianna Wynne Jones), Howl's Moving Castle is sure to entrance viewers from start to finish. The richly imaginative world is brought to life by stunning artwork that is typical of the japanese animation studio. And it was written and directed by the legend himself: Hayao Miyazaki. Need I say more?While reminiscent of a classical fairytale, the film ambitiously attempts to integrate steampunk elements as well. In short: Howl's Moving Castle is a whimsical whirlwind of everything you could ever want.Sophie Hatter, the protagonist of the film, begins as a reserved and decidedly unremarkable individual. Her character works in stark contrast to the flamboyant Howl Pendragon: a young wizard rife with power and pre-established potential. When the two fatefully cross paths, Sophie is quite literally swept off her feet by the legend himself. Unfortunately, this chance encounter ruffles the feathers of the scheming Witch of the Wastes, who fancies Howl for herself. In a spiteful fit of jealousy, the Witch casts a curse on the young hatter. Thus, the plot kicks off when Sophie wakes to find herself trapped in the body of a decrepit old woman. The gorgeously rendered kingdom in which the protagonists reside is inspired by the colourful city of Colmar, France. So, if the plot itself doesn't intrigue you, the beautifully illustrated landscapes are sure to have you hooked.Following the success of the critically acclaimed Spirited Away, this film certainly had big shoes to fill. And fill them it did. If anything, the enchanting tale of Howl's Moving Castle provides reassurance that Miyazaki has not yet lost his magic."
k_alby,"Jul 3, 2007",9/10,"When I first watched this film I did so on cable and with no real enthusiasm, since I seemed like it was a Spirited Away rip-off. The view of the film is very similar.However, I fell in love with the story, more so than I did with Spirited Away, it had a more grown-up aspect to it and it was still as magical as Spirited away.A story about courage, dealing with what you're given and it's so romantic that keeps you touched all the way through and allows you into the fantastic world that is Howl's Moving Castle.Maybe not as artistic in the making as Spirited away (although it's very artistic on its own), but I find the story just as beautiful or even more so. The movie looks well, it'll keep you entertained and it's not very long either, not slow-paced at all and simply beautiful to watch."
ThreeSadTigers,"Dec 29, 2007",N/A,"I've been a fan of Miyazaki's work since I first saw My Neighbour Totoro and Porco Rosso during a mid-90's double bill and fell in love with the intricate stories, simply, yet larger than life characters, and the always breathtaking visuals. A recent Film Four retrospective on the work of Miyazaki and the famed Studio Ghibli has given me the opportunity to reacquaint myself with some of his earlier works, which has really been great preparation for readying myself for a second helping of this!!Howl's Moving Castle is loosely based on the well-known book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, with Miyazaki and his collaborators opening up and elaborating on the text in order to incorporate many of the more recognisable Studio Ghibli trademarks. So, whereas the book once focused more clearly on the character of Howl, a wizard of dubious reputation, Miyazaki puts more emphasis on the character of Sofi, a heroine in the classic Studio Ghibli tradition. As the story unfolds the changes in the text point back to that earlier Miyazaki classic Porco Rosso, with the film continuing the idea of a character transformed by a curse (in this case, the young Sofi is cursed into the body of an old hag), seeking redemption in a anachronistic universe sometime during the First World War, that is overrun with flying machines, magical potions and other such Ghibli-like touches, such as fire demons, witchcraft and supernatural underworlds.As with Porco Rosso, the film's setting and the use of iconography suggest deeper themes that most children probably won't pick up on, meaning that this is very much a film to be cherished by adults and adolescents too!! As with all Miyazaki's work, the animation is astounding, here advancing on the lush visuals of previous film Spirited Away to create perhaps the most jaw-dropping animated film ever made (though Mamuro Oshii's Ghost in the Shell 2 and Katsuhiro Otomo's Steamboy are both serious contenders). The colours are rich and vivid throughout, whilst the attention to even the most minute of period detail is impeccable, all adding to that sweeping Miyazaki grace, his feel for characters and his deft understanding of how to construct a sequence (both in terms of action and drama... making the film both magical and plausible in equal measures!!).Howl's Moving Castle might be a little too obscure and sober for some viewers, especially when compared to some of Miyazaki's more celebrated works, such as My Neighbour Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, however, some perseverance reveals it to be every bit as memorable and beautiful as those two films, whilst the subtle references to early Miyazaki works like The Castle of Cagliostro and Laputa - Castle In The Sky make it an integral and equally magical entry into the Ghibli/Miyazaki canon."

silent_treatment666,"Jul 27, 2006",7/10,"Every so often. a wonderful movie comes along that I absolutely love and watch over and over and over. Howl's Moving Castle is one of those movies. I read about the movie online and bought it without ever having seen it before(which i never do). But needless to say, I'm very happy. The animation in this movie is superb. we can expect nothing less than amazing when it comes to Miyazaki's artwork. I also think that the characters in the English version did a great job. they were all wonderful Also, I recently read Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones. It's an amazing book. It's a lot different from the movie. But wonderful nonetheless. I know this comment really sucks. But i just wanted to rant because i'm bored. Bye."
TheDragonWizard,"Apr 18, 2020",4/10,"I watched the original Japanese dub with English subtitles. I was originally excited to watch it as it was from studio ghibli but I was disappointed.The positive: Graphics are beautiful. I can't find any other positive things about this movie.The negative: The plot is random and doesn't make any sense. It's basically a girl meets a prince charming and fall in love immediately (eye roll) with the back drop of war and threat of enemies of the protagonists.Then midway through the film the first enemy and its goonies have no threat and they stay together with the main characters. The second enemy attack for a good second and then nothing happened. At last the war ended all of sudden, happily ever after.There are no consequence of any actions from any characters. The war could have mean something or impact the characters but it didn't. I also find the main characters love unfounded as they only interacted a few times. There was a back story of the male lead which could have potential but it wasn't developed in the movie and he's as interesting as a staled bread.I don't understand why there were so many high reviews of this movies, but if you appreciate a certain amount of common sense and logic in the stories then I won't recommend this movie to you."

D_la,"Oct 24, 2005",9/10,"I always meant to see Spirited Away, but never got around to it, so I'm glad I got a chance to see this film, by the same director, in the cinema. Based on the book of the same title by Dianna Wynne Jones, ,cite>Howl's Moving Castle is an anime cartoon telling the story of Sophie, a young hat-maker who is cursed by the Witch of the Waste and turned into a ninety year old woman. The only way for her to break the curse is to help Howl and his fire demon Calcifer break the curse that they are suffering under.This film was wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of this style of animation, it is too similar too Pokemon, but it is really well done here. The strong point, for me, being the backgrounds, ships, planes etc, but not the characters.We never really know all that much about the war of the background, apart from the fact that it has something to do with a missing prince. But I prefer stories that don't feel the need to explain every single thing to you. This is very much worth watching, and although this is a dubbed version I never got the feeling that the voices were out of place.I haven't read the novel, so I can't comment on the translation from book to film, but I have read some by Wynne Jones and they are very readable."

me-1640,"Dec 19, 2006",9/10,"Sophie is forced to leave home because of a curse and becomes caught up with the wizard Howl and his companions, a young apprentice and a fire demon. What follows is a quest to break not just one curse but many while a pointless war rages across the land.Visually, this is the most stunning animation I have ever seen, even exceeding the heights achieved in Spirited Away, Miyazaki's previous feature. The attention to detail in the drawing, colouring and design in every single frame is without equal. The images are so vibrant that at times they almost saturate the senses: cities with a fantastic splendour from an imagined Europe of a century ago; mountain meadows with clouds scudding across them and drifts of wild flowers; a wizard's bedroom crammed with magical instruments and rendered in such detail that you could discover some unseen facet if you watched the scene a score of times. Unforgettable image follows unforgettable image through out this film.All the characters are well drawn, with the usual Ghibli trait of ambiguity as to the ""good"" or ""evil"" status of each. If there is a weakness in this movie then it is possibly in the plot. More precisely the plot resolution, which does seem to leave a few loose ends. Given the strength of every other part of this film, this is a point that is easily forgiven. A brilliant film that can be appreciated by anyone from the age of five to ninety-five."
cassidybremer,"Mar 20, 2023",7/10,"Loved the visuals and the creative universe in this film. Even in the parts I didn't fully understand or felt a little slow, whatever was on the screen was beautiful. I just found the second half of the movie a bit clunky and thrown together. Almost overstimulating plot wise? I wish we could have gotten more clarification on some of the characters and where they came from.I really enjoyed Sophie, she embraces things out of her control, forgive the witch who made her age, and became better at self love as the movie went on. I think turnip head was cute, but I was confused that Sophie was somehow his true love.Overall, I did enjoy the film, just wished some character arcs and plot lines were better explained."

If you don't know, you should watch this to find out. As with all of their movies, the animation is top notch and is beautifully complemented by memorable characters, both heart-warming and -wrenching moments, gorgeous soundtracks, and if you're not one for subtitles, the best English dubbing available."
reasonableserpent,"Mar 16, 2006",7/10,"Howwl's Moving Castle is a good movie that could have very easily been great. The animation was excellent, the voice acting (and casting) was fantastic, and for the most part of the film, the story was very good. The ending, however, just didn't make any sense. I have not read the novel (by Diana Wynne Jones) that the film is based on, and as much of the story that the film did convey is going to get me to check out the novel. I am betting that the cutting that was done was HUGE.I thought the PG rating was a little much, I'm fairly sure I've seen 'G' ratings with more objectionable material. Still well worth checking out, maybe not for those who are not fans of anime and animation."
noralee,"Jul 18, 2005",8/10,"""Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)"" builds on the animation and special effects classics of the past to create a marvelous visual world, though I haven't read the Diana Wynne Jones novel to know how much is invented by adapter/director Hayao Miyazaki.There's the scarecrow, magic meadow and shrinking witch from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the scary forest from ""Sleeping Beauty,"" the spell on the hero from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the frightening, drunken nightmare from ""Dumbo,"" the Cheshire Cat from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the battles from the Disney studio's anti-Nazi propaganda cartoons, the sad statue from Oscar Wilde's ""The Happy Prince,"" the chicken-legged house from the Russian Babi-Yar legends, as well as visual references to the classic adaptations of ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Gulliver's Travels,"" while characters morph in and out of spells like the faces from a classic Michael Jackson video.But this tale has unusual elements not seen before, as the tributes fly by. The spell by a spurned witch seems to have ironically turned the hero into a threatening woman-chaser, though, confusingly, as the spell progresses, and even more confusing when we travel to the past to see how he got enchanted, he becomes a peacemaker when the film suddenly changes to a war, causing him to fight off another physical transformation, like the demon-bitten hero of ""Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime),"" with a strong anti-war message.The witch has also cast a spell on the heroine, turning her into an old woman, and much of the delightful humor is from her struggling with her infirmities even as gray power triumphs, such as a scene when she and her nemesis compete to get up the royal stairs.Every inch of the screen is filled with a dazzling and quickly changing scene and climate and would make the sub-titled version a distraction. The English-language voices are mixed in effectiveness. Christian Bale is surprisingly bland with his Americanized accent, Emily Mortimer confusingly British as the young heroine. Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner are marvelous as mature witches, and Jean Simmons as old Sophie is both touching and humorous. Billy Crystal is way over the top as Calcifer the fire, but brings to mind his small role in ""The Princess Bride,"" and such sidekicks are usually done for broad humor.This is the first Miyazaki film I've seen in a theater so I don't know if the detail in his previous works is quite so breathtaking. It is charmingly set in a Jules Verne-period Victoriana where technology can coexist with magic, such as in flying machines. A complex townscape with streetcars is trumped by lovely scenes of snow falling and rain slowly soaking a dress.While the mother isn't dead as in most such films, just a bit pre-occupied, the occupants of the Castle re-create their own family, including caring for the apparently now senile witch -- wouldn't it be nice if we could all just add another bathroom to our houses.The music is fairly corny, so the long patches of silence are a relief.I don't know why this has been mostly distributed through art houses as children in the wider world of multiplexes would enjoy it, even if the story is a bit complicated and confusing."
jebyvyson,"Nov 12, 2019",9/10,"I would watch this movie so many times and never get sick of it. I first discovered this movie when I still had AT&T U-verse while I was recording some movies and shows. I remember it was on STARZ and I only saw the ending and I got very interested in it because it was the same studio who made Ponyo. I did managed to recorded the whole movie the next day to watch it.I love the characters, they were mostly interesting and colorful and you want to know their backstory. The animation, the visuals, the art style, and the colors are beautifully stunning. If this movie was in live-action(don't get any ideas Hollywood), it looked like it could be nominated for 5 Academy Award categories: Best Makeup & Hairstyling, Best Costume Design, Best Art Production, Best Visual Effects, and best Adapted Screenplay. The story is the reason why I want to write stories of my own, full of character development, action-adventure, and heavy drama romance.Not many 2D animated movies are looked at these days but this is a gem and I recommended you to watch it."
panwadtemdee,"Mar 2, 2021",10/10,"Howl's moving castle could be the favorite animation for many people. After watching this anime, Howl's moving castle became my top anime which stays in my heart. The story of Howl's moving castle is mysterious and incredible. It is an illustration of the magical world that provides various stunning scenery. The production of this anime is perfect, the motion is smooth and clean. The anime covers color theory which could bring us to the wonderful world of Howl's moving castle. However, Howl's moving castle is not a realistic story. The story also presents the gap of the society which becomes a great war in animation and especially teaches me about self-worth. The one main character of Howl's moving castle, Sofia has a problem with being a confident person. There are various causes in her life. This point of a story became my inspiration for doing something. If you are going to watch Howl's moving castle, I hope this could be your inspiration either. One more thing which made Howl's moving castle the best animation is the soundtrack which has beautiful music notes such as 'Merry Go Round of Life', the perfect match included in the anime made the perfection and complete the magical world on the screen with the aesthetic orchestra band.Howl's moving castle animation is inspired from the original novel. For who has read the book before. There are no worries because the anime adopts some parts of the novel's story. It might be because Ghibli studio adjusted the story for kid content.If you plan to watch Howl's moving castle, I hope you enjoy this extraordinary animation."
btm1,"Sep 9, 2009",8/10,"I caught this wonderfully animated family film when browsing Independent Film Channel (IFC) on cable TV in 2009. IFC claims all the films they shown are uncut. I had no preconceived ideas about the film, never heard of it before hand, and was not familiar with director Miyazaki or his previous work. So my review is based on how I felt about the movie, not how it stacks up against classics or film technique.Although I am an elder adult and watched it alone, not with my grandchild, I found it engrossing and enjoyable. (Although it is as suitable for young viewers as ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty."")The story, an anti-war fantasy or fairy tale, was original and unpredictable, which I like. The wizard Howl (who turns out to be the main male character of the film) says at one point something to the effect of ""The problem with a war between rulers is that the bombs fall on the innocent civilians.""The villains turn out to be complex, not just pure evil, and sometimes not evil at all.The scenery and costumes are done as a period piece, sort of Victorian era Europe. Even if just viewed as a series of still paintings with no story they would still be interesting to look at.In keeping with the imaginative story, I think with some imagination they could have come up with a more romantic English title than ""Howl's Moving Castle."" The moving castle certainly is interesting and plays a huge role in the story, but I would have liked something that suggests a struggle between wizards, a struggle over love and hate, and a struggle over war and peace."
Mantion,"Nov 19, 2007",9/10,"I am typically not a fan of most films animated in this fashion. Strangely I felt compelled to watch it and completely captivated. It had a very unique and wholly childish view of wars as novel games with no purpose. Interestingly enough it doesn't have any problems with violence so long as it is in rebellion of the establishment. The love story is sadly too faint, yet the fanciful imagery and delightful characters make this move entirely entertaining to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.I think fewer words are better, IMDb thinks otherwise. So I am forced to add more.If you stay focused on the movie you will easily understand it and it will be pleasantly predictable. If how ever if you want you want to be surprised or want to tax your mind, walk away from the movie skip 20 or so minutes. I don't believe this movie to be too childish but a child would enjoy it equally. No obscenity and fairly tame with no death graphic injuries. I believe shallow people will not get into this movie completely, but they should watch it the same. It would be unhealthy and truly depressing to eat the same super every night, even if it is our favorite meal."
bob the moo,"Oct 25, 2006",N/A,"Young Sophie is a plain girl who works in a hat store. When she meets the wizard Howl on her way home she finds herself protected by him as he flees from the demons of the Witch of the Waste. Later that night the Witch visits her in the shop and casts a spell turning her into an old woman but preventing her from telling anyone. Setting out into the wilderness, Sophie comes across Howl's castle and, thanks to a cheeky fire demon, settles in as the new cleaning woman while she can try and work out how to break her curse of old age. However while she retains her young heart in an old body, she learns that Howl has long since lost his heart and the pressure of wars is taking its toll on him.Although it is inferior to Spirited Away in some areas, I scoff at those that heavily criticise Howl for this because this film is still a lot better than a lot of the ""Happy Meal marketing campaigns"" that are served up to our children as films. This film has the usual Miyazaki traits of imaginative visuals, a range of characters, magic, humour and an interesting plot that is more than just easy sentiment and cliché. I agree with those that have said it is hard to follow at times because, although the main thrust of the narrative is engaging, I did find it distracting to not totally understand things like Sophie drifting between degrees of age etc. However this still served to engage me as I tried to understand the meaning of it within the plot. The theme of hearts is well used within the film and, again although I didn't understand the narrative totally, I liked the meaning within the story about the importance of the heart within each person. It touched me and although the detail will go over most children's heads, hopefully it should impact upon them to some degree. The pace is pretty good for the most part but I was a bit disappointed with the delivery at the end  it was all neatly tied up and done very quickly; the downside of this being that it does feel a bit forced and obvious in contrast with the more controlled material up to that point (Turniphead's fate is a perfect and unnecessary example of what I mean).The animation is typically beautiful and audiences should guard against accepting this as the standard simply because it is the case so often. I loved the look of the film, from the trademark things like the European feel to the cities, to the design and beauty of the flying machines right down to the usual mix of imagination within the characters. The characters are the usual delight as well  not afraid to make them ""ugly"" while also drawing beauty and goodness out of their hearts. Most obviously this is seen in the character of Sophie, who is never better than when she is old  how many other children's films would be confident enough in their audience to put an old woman in the lead role? Howl is just as interesting although his transformation may be hard to follow for younger viewers. Simmons and Mortimer are both good as Sophie although Simmons dominates her younger counterpart. Bale is always good value even if he could have benefited from a slower pace to develop his character better. Crystal is a joy as Calcifer and he adds humour and spark (sorry) to his scenes. Bacall is classy presence in a good character while I liked Hutcherson's turn as Markl.Overall this is not the perfect film because the plot is not as easy to follow as it could have been and the heart (sorry) of the story could have been delivered in a more patient and slower manner, this isn't too much of a problem (although the ending is clumsy) and the majority of the film is strong enough to cover it. The animation is flawless and the characters enjoyable while the story has plenty of interest in there to hold the interest. Has areas where it could have been better but is still a fantastic little film for the family, children or adults."

Though it's a bit of a disappointment, the story is murky and it's a bit difficult to understand what's happening but it never got to the point where I was bored watching it.

While the story is not all that great it's still a great movie and certainly can be appreciated by its visual wonder."

ignatiusloyala,"Oct 30, 2005",7/10,"Howl's moving castle is a very Miyazaki anime. And like the recent Miyazaki amines, e.g. Spirited Away, this is a slight let-down.I don't know whether it is intended in the original or whether the adaptation just wasn't good, but the plot of the movie is rather thin. It's set in a warring European state (Germany? Austria?) and there's this sorcerer, Howl, who wants to use his power to stop this war. Impressive, but not quite there. The fact that this subplot seems so weighty but weakly developed makes it ultimately look superfluous. So is Howl's obsession with beauty and the involvement of the Queen of the Dump.There's a lot of dazzle in the movie (walking and flying in the air, exploring Howl's past, Califer's powering the moving castle) like Spirited Away, but like Spirited Away, the film floats on too thin a plot to make it memorable like Miyazaki's previous works. And in fact, Spirited Away and Howl's moving Castle share a lot of common elements (a monster/animal/what-do-you-call-it turned human, which or who can fly, an ingenuous girl brought to a place full of magic, black-shadow like demons, etc) one constantly reminds the audience of the other.While still enjoyable on the whole, the lack of freshness of the storyline renders it an anime with a Miyazaki plot built on a different set."

If not familiar with his name, Miyazaki-san also created ""Spirited Away,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" and ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds."" Howl's Moving Castle is his latest film to date and is sure to be an instant classic.The story follows nineteen-year-old Sophie, a shy girl with a lack of self confidence who works in her family's hat shop. Everybody in town is talking about the mysterious Wizard Howl who arrived recently- they can't wait to meet the handsome wizard! Sophie, however doesn't bother with the gossip and decides to walk to her sister Lettie's work and pay her a call. While walking to her sister's job, a bakery, she turns down an alley and runs into two soldiers. Shy and a bit confused, she tries to avoid their flirting, but fails.... A handsome blonde man saves her from the flirts, but involves her into his own escape- from the dreaded Witch of the Waste's henchmen. The man takes hold of Sophie and lightly lifts her up and flies through the sky. He drops her off at her sister's work and flies off. Could it be the mysterious Wizard Howl?!?!?!? When Sophie returns home from her sister's, she closes the hat shop. A large, bulging woman enters the closed shop, jeers Sophie, and when Sophie sticks up for herself, the woman turns Sophie into an old woman. The woman admits that she is the Witch of the Waste and leaves speedily. Sopie is then left with the problem of being a nineteen-year-old girl who is stuck in an eighty-year-old's body. Sophie leaves her house and job to find a cure for the curse. She finds a scarecrow on the way and he leads her to HOWL'S CASTLE! She falls asleep by a fire and wakes up to see Howl's apprentice, Markl. She tells Markl that she's the new cleaning lady. Howl arrives back to his castle... but Howl's the handsome man from the day before!!!! What could this situation evolve into....?If you find it hard to love the remarkable, AMAZING story, you won't be able to help falling in love with the colors, detail, and the scenery of this animation. The Japanese and the English voice actors are great, but I recommend listening to the Japanese- it's a great version and has much more detailed dialog (the English subtitles are good, too).This movie is based upon the novel by Diana Wynne Jones.I hope that my comments help! Please watch this movie- it's too good to pass up!"
zzhhhqing,"May 22, 2020",10/10,"First of all, the film background is Japan during World War II. In the real world during World War II, wars raged and the situation was turbulent, and the people were forced into a brutal war without help. However, Miyazaki sketched such a castle: it has doors leading to various places to avoid the flames of war and go to the peaceful countryside; it is powered by talking fires and has fairytale colors; it is transformed from industrial scrap Cheng, ugly and clumsy and some love. Its interior is so incompatible with World War II, and the outside is confusingly chaotic. It is the reflection of the people of World War II and the choice to avoid and join the world.The pacifism and humanitarian spirit are the core contents implied in every movie of Mr. Gong Lao, and are passed on to the next generation of young people in the world through cartoons. Hayao Miyazaki is a film worker who deserves admiration. The humanities and social feelings of his life are put into film"
martyharrington,"Dec 16, 2019",10/10,"To say that this is a good movie is a vast understatement. I love to watch this movie time and again. A definite repeat watch for me.
The animation is so exquisite that I highly recommend it as a first watch movie. This is another anime that I first watched at one of my conventions and I fell in love with the characters and the storyline. An excellent movie for everyone. I hope you enjoy it too."
burgan6203,"Sep 12, 2005",8/10,"After years of waiting, I finally got to see ""Howl's Moving Castle"" last night. While I must admit that it is mildly disjointed in places, this fact did not dampen the enthusiasm I felt for it. The animation of course is beautiful(particularly the eponymous castle itself), the music from Joe Hisaishi fits wonderfully, and the way in which Miyazaki handles his heroine's dilemma(an eighteen-year old cursed with the body of a ninety-year old)is much more mature and insightful than any Disney film could ever think to do.And, of all the film's secondary characters, I will just say right now that the wheezing dog has got to be the most enduring imaginable. You may understand after you have seen ""Howl's Moving Castle"" for yourself."
mbhgkmsgg,"Nov 16, 2020",9/10,"A film truly filled to the brim with wonder. Howl's Moving Castle never ceases to surprise you with its imagination. No matter how far into the film you get, and no matter how certain you are that you have finally seen everything, the film just keeps on giving.Although Howl's Moving Castle isn't quite as good as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, it is still a wondrous and gorgeous movie. Indeed, it is just as spectacular visually as the other two films.
However, where it lacks a little, is in the story. Ultimately it ends up being a rather simple, yet pleasant story about the power and magic of love. It does tackle themes like the futility of war, as well as the difficulties we face as we age. What on paper sounds like a rather intricate but exciting draft for a story, ends up being simplified into a story of love.I certainly didn't mind the story, however comparing it with Miyazaki's other films, it leaves something to be desired. But, what Howl's Moving Castle lacks in story, it more than makes up for with its endless imagination. Even though I'm relatively used to the weird and wacky that fill these movies, this one just kept on surprising me.
Just the castle alone is a spectacular showcase of the desire to think completely outside of the box and to do things that no one else has done. Add everything else that this movie has to offer and you're in for a magical ride.The thing that makes Miyazaki's films so great is the sense of wonder and adventure combined with beauty and emotion. In that regard Howl's Moving Castle is no different. I faintly remember seeing this in the cinema when it came out and the feeling of absolute astonishment I experienced. I was quite a bit younger then and I had never seen anything like it. And even still today, 16 years later, that same sense of astonishment fills me.While Howl's Moving Castle isn't as good as some of Miyazaki's other films, it certainly holds its ground. I have always struggled to not love these films because of how fearless they are in their vision and execution. While this film doesn't tackle with particularly heavy themes, it is endlessly entertaining and will fill you with joy."
gavin6942,"Jun 23, 2015",7/10,"When an unconfident young woman is cursed with an old body by a spiteful witch, her only chance of breaking the spell lies with a self-indulgent yet insecure young wizard and his companions in his legged, walking castle.By going through the IMDb Top 250 for every year since 1996, I have had the opportunity to see just about every major Japanese animation of the last twenty years. Most I simple do not care for, not really understanding how such primitive animation is considered revolutionary. The fantasy elements are good, but we need better animation.This film seems to be the exception. More than any other anime I have seen, ""Howl"" looks like a professional job, with a great story, fun characters, and rather decent animation. Some of it is still choppy, but it has a more slick look than the others."
may-54285,"Jan 17, 2025",6/10,"Revisit 'Howl's Moving Castle'. Every character shines brightly. This time, I noticed the scarecrow that was easily overlooked. He just silently guarded Sophie. When she became angry for Hal and cried outside in the rain, the scarecrow must have appeared beside her. I will carry an umbrella and hold up a clear sky for her, quietly accompanying her. When she was drying clothes, he happily transformed into a drying pole, sharing her calmness and happiness. When she was in danger, he rushed ahead and blocked the wooden board that was about to fall off the cliff, saving Sophie from danger. Hal almost never knew about the existence of the scarecrow. Just for Sophie, he has always been loyal there. He only gave her help, but he was so tactful, never causing her trouble, never interfering in her life, not causing any misunderstandings from Hal, and never causing criticism from the world. In every woman's life, there will be two people. One is her beloved, all her attention is drawn to him, whether happy or worried. The other one is her scarecrow. Perhaps for others, scarecrows have many flaws. Perhaps he is cold and decisive towards other things. However, in front of her, he was always so polite and gentle. He is always silently giving. But I don't want her to have any burden. He never confessed his feelings, and even didn't let her know about his exhaustion and pain."
refresh_daemon,"Feb 1, 2007",9/10,"For some reason, I always go into watching films by Miyazaki with a more than unexpected amount of hesitation. And yet, I usually find myself remarkably surprised and, in the end, both moved and thoroughly entertained. This happened when I watched both Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. There's a very unique feel to the films by Miyazaki and it's immediately foreign, yet after a little time, I find it tugging at my soul in surprising ways.Howl's Moving Castle is about a young girl named Sophi, who gets turned into a 90-year old woman by a curse and ends up living with a wizard that she has a crush on. And some stuff happens afterward.Immediately striking is the visual style of the film, which is in the same fantastic and imaginative vein as other films produced by Studio Ghibli. The central theme of love, although often ambiguous, is quite potent, although not as nuanced as the portrayal of maturity and hope found in Spirited Away. Nevertheless, the story, which cannot be described without throwing spoilers everywhere is wonderful and whimsical, but maintains all the coherence necessary for a western audience to understand it.And, there's precious little more that I can say about this film, other than that it's great and I highly recommend it. It's a beautiful little film about love. Also, the professional American voice talent recruited for this film are far competent for their tasks and Billy Crystal in particular is surprisingly suited for the voice of the fire demon, Calcifur. Great voice ensembles like these put the amateurs that voice dubbed anime television programs to great shame (the 6 people that do all the voices, that is).I love it. 9/10."
Cin_E_File,"Apr 27, 2022",9/10,"Just because this is my least favorite of the 11-12, it does not mean I hate it, I really enjoyed the movie. I love as usual of the Miyazaki movies, but the pacing felt out of place."
ele17,"Aug 20, 2009",9/10,"I love this movie. It is so magical that you can't just describe it...you HAVE to watch it. Maybe someone won't understand it completely, but it just need you to dive in the story and be a part of it.And the story is about (so complicated so simple) a girl who get coursed by an old witch, forcing her to find a way to break this curse by joining a group of strange people (people?) who lives in a moving castle...Each character is well developed, the colors are amazing, the music and the atmosphere...i love it.Miyazaki gave us not just an animated movie, but a wonderful journey in the form of a magical dream. Don't miss this one."
Two_Pieces_of_Christina,"May 15, 2006",7/10,"Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones's 1986 novel, this is the tale of young hat-worker Sophie Hatter. When a curse is placed on her by the Wicked Witch of the Waste, she turns into a 90-year old woman. Ashamed of her looks, and fearing she will be of no use to her step-mother in their shop, she flees to the countryside in seek of shelter and to somehow get help to lift the curse.On her journey she meets a helpful scarecrow (who, incidentally, is a source of terror in the novel) who directs her to local wizard Howl's 'Moving Castle'. This isn't just a name - Howl's castle does indeed move - it hops along on spindly legs, groaning under its weight, and puffs of steam emanate into the surrounding air. Inside, Sophie finds the castle is not all as it seems - it is disproportionately small and shabby, and able to open its door onto four different locations at will. Calcifer, a fire demon, powers the castle and Howl is not quite the evil, girl's heart-eating wizard he's made out to be. Instead he's shallow, vain, tempestuous and, to Sophie's horror, handsome. Sophie makes a deal with Calcifer to break the contract he holds with Howl, in return for her curse being lifted. But will Sophie end up breaking the spell herself, and will Howl in fact see her for what she really is - a beautiful, resourceful young woman, and return her feelings?World-renowned director Hayao Miyazaki has done a good job here. He has taken great liberties with Diana Wynne Jones's original story, but this is no bad thing in some ways - the film is a pure visual feast. From the Wicked Witch of the Waste's obese puffing up the palace stairs, to Calcifer's near death, and Howl's slime explosion, there are some brilliant images here. The scope and depth of the scenery, the close-ups of Sophie's eyes, and Howl's blond hair have all been obviously attended to with great detail.I would urge anyone to watch the original film with subtitles. The actors' voices are much more in tone with what's on screen, in particular Calcifer's comical screeching shouldn't be missed.I'm all for artistic vision, and the different ways that novels translate from page to screen. However one major aspect that I didn't agree with in this version was Sophie's differing appearance - when angered, or in a fit of passion, she grows younger before our eyes. She's cursed, not just emotional! If it was as easy as that perhaps she wouldn't need to hang out at the castle mopping Howl's floor.Don't worry if you haven't read the novel first, but do make a point to do so at some point (anything written by Wynne-Jones is worth a read, for that matter). Although this film does arguably stand on its own merits, to miss the genius of Wynne-Jones's writing would be a great shame.This film is a good example of well-crafted animation, inspiration and directorial vision."
flechterinhe-39253,"Feb 7, 2018",10/10,"I've always loved how Miyazaki manage to convey so much emotion in his movies. This one is the perfect example of that. Through the story of a young woman is cursed with an old body by a spiteful witch, Miyazaki explore many themes: war, friendship, aging, changing, redemption...The setting is also captivating and the soundtrack is absolute perfection."
danisummers-60750,"Jun 20, 2024",7/10,"So- starting off with the perfection of this movie/film: The Art. It is gorgeous and incredibly well done in every aspect. The perspectives, anatomy, colors, everything! The Animation! The fluidity! The production is also very high quality.Production also deserves props. Voice acting and sound design is absolutely solid. The editing works well with the atmosphere of various scenes.The pacing of the film, animation, and action/movement is very good. Like with every Ghibli film, it takes it's time.Now... the writing is good but has some amateurish mistakes, especially whenever the romance storyline is in focus. No buildups or character explorations with most of these scenes. There are great concepts outside from what was directly inspired or taken from the book but the execution is ... it suffices but it could've been better.I wouldn't call this an adaptation. Is more of a retelling to me. The story was not slightly rewritten, but changed a lot. Which is not a problem but I feel like the film does not know what to focus on. What their themes should tell, what they should tell. It didn't even have Miyazaki's usual people who deeply inspire each other love story. It was more like - two kind people kinda fall at first sight and that is what pushes them to do certain things... I don't know. I have watched this three times by now.First impression: Wonderful movie with a great story. Another ghibli banger.Watch it with a friend: Friend disliked it. I still liked it a lot.Third watch, after reading the book: Eh... it's a good movie.I think the biggest flaw is the character writing. I believe that is my grave gripe with this pretty film."
ryzinhy,"Oct 22, 2005",4/10,"Having seen (and loved) Laputa many years ago and then being re-introduced to Ghibli's work via Sprited Away, I have recently been working my way through the back catalogue. Miyazaki has his name associated with some truly remarkable films (Laputa, Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, etc...) however he has also been involved in making some films which are little more than impenetrable clap-trap. Sadly Howl's Moving Castle falls into the second category (along with Nausicaa IMO). The plot is almost non-existent, and what little story remains is confusing and fragmented. The film suffers from the same problems as Nausicaa, in that an intriguing premise is established, but which never reaches a satisfying conclusion."
baptismofspace,"Aug 26, 2011",10/10,"I had heard great things about this movie and I'm a big fan of the other Hayao Miyazaki's films I've seen (Princess Monoke & Spirited Away) so I was sure I would enjoy this movie. Alas Howl's turned out to be my favorite Miyazaki film and is one of my favorite movies of all time.As in his other films the animation in Howl's Moving Castle was stunning. The behemoth walking castle, the vibrant colors of the various landscape, the ever-changing skies overhead, all contribute to the visual beauty of the movie. The plot of the film was fantastically woven with many surprises, delights, and triumphs which are a testament to both Hayao Miyazaki for the screenplay and Diana Wynne Jones for the novel on which the movie is based. A surprise for many viewers may be the depth of the characters in this animated film. All of the main characters are developed fully which allows the viewer to relate to characters that aren't even necessarily human, in addition to adding realism to each character.The steampunk technology and the mix of magic and science create a novel type of world for the film to be set in. Its intricate set-up allows the viewer to connect to something entirely different from the world he or she lives in by mixing realistic & fantastical elements. In fact I think one of the things that makes this film particularly astounding is the way it can turn the mundane into the magical. Things that all people can relate to (cleaning, aging, family, war, love) are taken from our world and put into the otherworldly realm of Miyazaki's imagination, where they take on a completely new light.I absolutely adore the film and it was an immediate 10/10 in my mind. The only thing I disliked was the feeling near the end when one knows the masterpiece is coming to a close which is, of course, unavoidable. Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle is an absolutely beautiful, beautiful film and I recommend it to everyone!"

She starts to live with Howl in his moving castle.First, buildings, characters, and clothes are colorful and artistic. Simply, we enjoy just pictures. Soft color combination and depiction makes Grand worldview, I think. Story line and themes is difficult a little. Watching this a number of times help to digestion and give new a way of appreciating and messages.I like this movie the best in Ghibli works. First, Howl is so cool in that both appearance and inside. His personality is conceited but weakling. Though he looks sorry on the face of it, these bring his gentility and strength, I think. No matter how many times I watch is, I enjoy Howl's attraction and I think real theme of the movie."

It's one of my favorites and i encourage you all to read the book, along with it's sequel, and the other works of Ms. Jones. I was thrilled to learn that they would be making a movie, and although a live action feature would be nice too, i am still glad for it. I hope they make movies of the Chrestomanci Chronicles, but then again i like that it's sort of a secret with myself since i don't know anyone else who's read the books. Maybe now you all will."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 16, 2019",6/10,"'Howl's Moving Castle (2004)' is certainly a strange film. It's an endearingly strange film, though. It's filled to the brim with interesting ideas, inventive visuals and inspired animation, which makes up for its somewhat scattershot central story and slightly strange pacing. The characters are all very well realised - and beautifully dubbed, I'll add - but the titular Howl is ever so slightly inconsistent (or, at least, presented inconsistently). Of course, his enigmatic nature is a part of his appeal, but he seems to lack a solid motivation - as do several of the other side-players - and the more we learn, the less it makes sense, in a way. Even our protagonist loses her drive part-way through, putting aside her quest simply to spend time as a housemaid. In her case, however, her character always shines through as she's constantly a wise, kindhearted person who's willing to forgive even those who have done her the most wrong. The narrative she finds herself caught up in isn't quite as strong-willed, but it's suitably tumultuous and charmingly off-beat. It keeps you engaged through its duration and is certainly unique, allowing Miyazaki and his team to play around with their intriguing designs and animation techniques. I especially enjoy the tar-like henchmen that pursue our heroes; their bulging bodies squeeze through small gaps, twist together as they struggle to stay upright and merge with one another to form huge, undulating masses. Overall, though it has some issues and doesn't hit home as hard as it perhaps should (in its more emotional moments), this is an entertaining affair throughout. It's a visual treat, too. 6/10"

But at the same time they have deep intricate plots. that require thinking. Not everything is just laid out for you. It also contains a great all-star cast. It is a pleasure to listen to Christian Bale's voice as howl. He brings so much life to the character. Same thing with Billy Crystal.

hernaniturralde,"Sep 25, 2006",10/10,"It happened with this movie as it happened (to my surprise) with ""My neighbor Totoro"" and other Miyazaki's films. People asking ""why this?"" and ""why that?"". Since when is necessary to have everything explained to you in order to enjoy/understand a film? Films, as many other artistic expressions, work in many levels and cannot (should not) be criticized because a certain criteria is not being followed. Of course, everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but: putting down a film because it doesn't spoon-feed you, the way 90% of US films do nowadays, and dropping it's rate so people might think it isn't a good film (and therefore not watching it) is just plain wrong. Howl's Moving castle is an excellent film. Period. Yes, it is a Japanese film(therefore a ""foreign"" film. LOL). Yes, certain aspects of it (very few really) speak only to the natives. Yes, some matters presented in the film require you to think about them once it is over. But only because the film industry is almost monopolized by US films doesn't mean that we should accept its manufacture as a standard. Let me tell you, I enjoy a good pop-corn movie every once in a while, I really do, but there is so much more going around than that. Please don't scrutinize an art form with such a narrow view. It makes both (you and the arts) look bad."
Leofwine_draca,"Apr 24, 2013",8/10,"HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is another wonderful animation from Japan's Studio Ghibli, a children's cartoon that proves to be a moving, inventive and utterly imaginative experience for kids and adults alike. To describe it too much would be to spoil the fun; suffice to say, this is a film packed with incident and insight, with engaging characters and larger than life situations.This time around, it's an anti-war feature, with war providing the backdrop to the central tale. The character of the young girl who is transformed through witchcraft into an old woman is an intriguing one, and the titular castle is a superbly animated creation. I particularly liked the supporting characters in this film: Disney usually make the characters that support the protagonists irritating in the extreme, but here they're quite brilliant: the bounding scarecrow, the living fire, even the Witch of the Wastes.I find Ghibli films to be fairly hit or miss; some I love, but others like PRINCESS MONONOKE and SPIRITED AWAY are overrated in my mind. Not so this one."
chubb43,"Apr 3, 2005",9/10,"The movie is quite frankly, one of the most imaginative, creative movies I've seen this year. The general story is so utterly fantastic that you immediately know that it can't happen in real life. My only complaint is that there are so many times where it justdoesn't make ne sense. At the start of the movie, well, you basically have to take a long time to make sense of everything thats happening, especially since if u don't comprehend Japanese, everything has to be co-ordinated between your reading and watching. The ending really disappointed me, because it basically made so little sense it ruined (to a small extent) the wonderful experience of Howl's moving castle. What do I say? I recommend it to everybody, because it really has a good blend of the ingredients for wide appeal movies. Don't watch ne voice over versions, it completely ruins the delicate balance the movies achieve, especially when one character's lines stretches for 5 seconds after the animation's mouth has stopped moving."

My first impressions were ""oooh joy another film that would probably be boring"" But that all changed when i sat down and watched it; it just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover and that goes for films too. I found the animation was brilliant it's bright, colourful; i especially love the scenes on the mountain tops, Star Lake, and th Royal City; even Howls bedroom is colourful with all the antiques! The film truly does capture the audiences' imagination and pulls them into the film. The characters expressions and talent voices from Christain Bale, Jean Simmons, etc are truly great and so is the story! If you need to watch a good movie filled with all sorts and is an animation then this is the film for you i can't stop watching it even to this day!!!! So from me enjoy 10 star"
DawsonChu,"Jun 6, 2018",6/10,"In this film, director Hayao Miyazaki overly focused on the design of the romantic plot. In addition, the expression of the anti-war theme is not entirely based on the script, and it is somewhat self-talking.
Therefore, although the movie is full of various visual wonders, due to the relatively immature handling of drama conflicts, all this lacks a platform that can truly release emotions. In the end, this story full of narrative ambition and various complex metaphors ended up in a random private reconciliation of several major characters. Compared with Miyazaki's best work, what the film lacks is really deep thinking and brave expression."
jluis1984,"May 12, 2006",10/10,"Director Hayao Miyazaki has always given more than simple animated films. With deep roots in the fantasy genre, his stories go beyond the concept of fable and become epic stories of love, drama and comedy thanks to his highly developed writing style and his multidimensional characters. ""Hauru no Ugoku Shiro"" or ""Howl's Moving Castle"", is a film that serves as very good example of Miyazaki's style; it contains the epic fantasy elements he has constantly developed since his debut in 1984 with Kaze no Tani no Naushika (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds) and also contains the light-hearted comedy of efforts like ""Majo no Takkyûbin"" (Kiki's Delivery Service) of 1989.The movie is set in a fantasy version of Europe where magic and technology coexist. Sophie is a young girl in a small town of a nation on the verge of war; she is very mature and responsible but is also very shy and unconfident. One night she is visited by the Witch of Watse, and transformed into an old woman. Since the curse forbids her to speak about the curse itself, she decides to go and find a way to return to her real age by herself, but in her quest she ends up in the fabled Moving Castle of the legendary wizard Howl, who is said to be a cruel ruthless monster. She will discover that Howl is very different than what legends say.Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Miyazaki completely makes the story his own while still retaining the story's core plot. This in no ways means that the adaptation is not good, it just means it is different. As usual, Miyazaki focuses in his favorite themes of love, redemption and catharsis and gives the story his touch. The humane traits of the characters makes them multidimensional and like in the rest of his work, there is no clear good and evil, only complex relations between characters.As I wrote above, the film feels like a summary of Mizayaki's previous work and it is probably the movie that most clearly defines the director's style and philosophy. The classical elements of epic quests are present but are mixed with elements of romance and comedy that never feel out of place. Miyazaki mixes genres perfectly and gives the movie an unnatural charm that can only be described as magic.Of course, the animation is top-notch like Studio Ghibli usually does. The beautiful landscapes inspired by European towns and cities make a great contrast with the advanced technology and the visually stunning magic of this fantastic world. The Moving Castle, a walking metal behemoth, is at the same time imposing and strangely beautiful. There is no scene in the movie that is not either beautiful, mesmerizing or both. The animation by itself is a work of art.The characters are very well defined and are very likable. It is easy to identify with them thanks to the very well-written script. The detailed emotions the characters have go beyond simple plot points, and it was great to see so complex characters come to life in an animated film. I have not heard the English dubbing, but I must say that the Japanese one truly captured the feeling of the characters and as usual in Ghibli, the cast was up to the challenge.""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a very enjoyable film that displays Miyazaki's style at its best. It is a great film not only for kids or fans of Japanese animation, but for the general audience. Very few films these days capture this kind of magic, and I must add that ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is not only among Hayao Miyazaki's best works, it is one of the best films of the last years. 10/10"
kilgoretrout1944,"Jan 11, 2026",7/10,"Over the past year I've seen some of Miyazakis other movies, such as Spirited Away, The Wind Rises, Kikis Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky. While Howls Moving Castle is overall a pretty good movie, I consider it to be the worst out of the ones I mentionedMiyazaki has a certain style that is in all of his films, and this one is no different. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, but I still think it was a good movie.Not Miyazakis best movie, but still worth watching, especially if you're a fan of his other moviesThe only Miyazaki movies I have left to watch in the future are My Neighbor Totoro and Princess Mononoke, both of which I saw about 20 years ago."
Michael Kenmore,"Mar 19, 2006",2/10,"I don't have much to say about the movie reiterating the points of the plot as already explained by comments below, other than the fact that I thought it cannot be possible to top or even equal the top-notch quality and subliminally emotional power of the magic fantasy hybrid of the Grimm Brothers, Lewis Carroll & Japanese folklore in Spirited Away.Howl's Moving Castle retains some of Hayao Miyazaki's magic in storytelling and animation but it's not certainly his best. In fact, it's his worst since the embarrassingly contrived Kiki's Delivery Service.It seems to me that the strange mess of Howl's Moving Castle confirms there is a theoretical pattern that Miyazaki does his best when he creates original stories inspired by the fantastic works of European & Asian literature and turn out fantastic animated films and manga, but his skills do not translate well in the attempted adaptation of previous published works.Don't get me wrong; I have a great deal of admiration for Mr. Miyazaki. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind comic book series is a worthy companion piece to C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien's famous epic literacy works. He has an incredibly imaginary mind with the penchant for telling outlandish stories reminiscent of Aesop and Hans Christian Anderson. That's the only positive compliment I have for Howl's Moving Castle in spite of its mind-bendingly glaring story and character development flaws.The story as written by Mr. Miyazaki (I watched the Japanese version with English subtitles instead of awful-sounding English dub) starts all right. . .then it became a confounding mess leading to the bizarre ending that feels rushed as though the production schedule had to be fulfilled on time in time for a projected theatrical release. Tim Burton's horrible 2001 re-make of Planet of the Apes suffered the same ""rushed production"" effect and this lesson remains unlearned.A further production delay with Miyazaki's storyboard revision to iron out the problems might have improved the ending and clarify some plot points and character development to keep the story consistent, but that wasn't the option. Studio Ghibli and its subcontractors came close to missing the production deadline for Spirited Away (as tensely explained in a documentary as an extra on Region 1 DVD) but miraculously turned out a masterpiece right on schedule.So Howl's Moving Castle, however visually pleasant, falters in the second and third act in terms of marginal storytelling. The film resorts to Miyazaki's scenarios that border on the incomprehensibly bizarre towards the closing. Not to mention the fact the movie carry the sledgehammer approach to delivering the main theme. It's better to be subliminal than to be so screeningly obvious it becomes annoying that may inspire ""who cares?"" apathy at the end when the two-hour ordeal is over.I get the point, Studio Ghibli. Try to be coherent and subtle in the next Miyazaki production, please.The last third of the movie embodies the term ""deus ex machina"". Look the phrase up in a dictionary. That's why the movie is an abominable mess that render the plot incomprehensible that rely on overactive imagination to move the movie along to unsustainable and unnecessarily overlong length. The Neverending Story this movie ain't. It probably isn't faithful to the source material, either.* out of four, courtesy of a very disappointed Miyazaki fan."
GeneR777,"Jun 30, 2006",10/10,"I have to admit to being swayed by the jacket covers for DVD's and the marketing material used to promote movies. So when I saw Howl's Moving Castle and one of the characters (Howl) as a half-human, half-blue beast, I immediately thought, ""Eww, that's weird. What in the world were they thinking?"" Even though it is by Miyazaki, I have to admit that bias/immaturity on my own part.So I stayed away from the film for quite some time. (I've also noticed a pattern: I tend to stay away from the best films out there for the most stupid, shallow reasons only to be later blown away by how good they were.)So eventually I managed to rent this film. I do not even know why it got on my Netflix list. But I saw it. And I was hooked. I watched it once, twice, three times, okay, I stopped at five times because I had to return it or incur the wrath of my girlfriend. But there were several moments throughout the film that really touched me and I was so moved by Emily Mortimer's rendition of Sophie's emotions that it left me perfectly spellbound by the end of the film.""Okay, I'll just watch one more scene..."" (I also realized you probably can not do this, because pretty soon if you start at any part of the movie chances are you will continue watching until the credits...)Okay, the review: It's a spellbinding film. A bit unconventional by Western standards, but definitely a movie that takes the audience on an adventure (which is rather refreshing if you consider how many movies promise adventure and give you recycled material today). This film is very endearing as all the characters feel real. Miyazaki excels in creating humorous characters and situations, developing a very warm view of life and everyone in it. The story is sometimes slow, but overall it feels honest and original which is saying a lot in today's cinema.Definitely worth renting at the DVD store, or, if you can, watching it on the big screen."
aw58,"Aug 8, 2006",10/10,Some of the things in the book weren't in the movie but if you've ever read a Diana Wynne Jones book you'll understand how hard it would be to animate. Her books always have more than ten things going on at once it seems and everything is always resolved at the end of the book never halfway through.Anyway....I have been a fan of Miyazaki's since last year really and fell in love with the movie Spirited Away thankfully TCM played most of his other movies as I am on a somewhat limited budget.And I'd been a fan of Diana Wynne Jones for a couple of years. When I finally bought the book Howl's Moving Castle it had the promotional cover on it that simply said Now A Major Motion Picture (not with any artwork from the movie on the cover). I had a couple of days of wondering about that. I hadn't heard anything about Howl's Moving Castle being a movie. I thought maybe it was some sort of fluke and the printing press had accidentally gotten my hopes up.And than by some mysterious force I found out who was doing the movie...Hayao Miyazaki! Imagine my surprise! I was ecstatic.I love these movies more than the Disney movies I grew up with. My family has been doing art for years (in fact my dad told me that my great-grandfather worked on some backgrounds for Disney back in the day) And we've all been disgusted at the way Disney has become completely CGI and none of the original hand-drawn artwork.So if you like the book or Hayao Miyazaki or even old time hand-drawn animation this would be the movie for you!
siderite,"Jun 9, 2005",9/10,"I enjoyed this movie almost as much as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. You meet here the same magic world, with witchy grannies, courageous boys and girls motivated by love, silly warmongers with their little guns, people turning to demons when they succumb to their evil emotions. Basically you have a world on the brink of technology and also magic, the power of both being controlled by the human heart.It's a great film to watch, the music is a little to soapy for my taste, the animation great, the characters are interesting, but I couldn't relate to any of them, this maybe being the bad side of the movie (or maybe my bad side :) ), the story is nice and the ending happy. If you are a Miyazaki fan, this is a must for you."
imcarl,"Jun 23, 2005",8/10,"I think I should say this outright before I get started, Miyazaki cannot top Spirited Away. Orson Welles could not top Citizen Kane. Simply put, some directors make something so good they cannot beat it. So we should not expect too much. Needless to say, this is still Howl's Moving Castle is a very good film. The animation is rich, not quite as much as Spirited Away, but you cannot expect that much from one person. It's just fun to watch.I guess what hurts this film is that it uses every same plot device Miyazaki has used before. Howl has much in common Haku. The Wicked Witch of the Waste becomes much the same as every other MIyazaki initial villain. Sophie's journey has much in common with Chihiro's or Sen's. In many ways, this repeats a lot from Spirited Away but with too much absurdity and not of charm. The plot and explanations become complex or thrown together. It just doesn't have that usually ingenuity of his other movies.The entire point of this movie in the end was to take our breathe away with amazing sites. And it did. The animation is better and while it is not as good as his other films, it still is better than a lot of the stuff out there. So if you like Miyazaki or if you just like animation, see this movie. It's worth the five or six bucks. But don't expect a masterpiece like ""Spirited Away."""
momoko-3,"Mar 27, 2005",9/10,"I know I'm going to get slammed by people who love the original book, which this movie is only very loosely based upon, but I have to say it. I like the improvised storyline of the movie that Hayao Miyazaki wrote compared to the original. Yes, the original is funny and upbeat whereas the movie is a little dark. But I don't care. To me, it's a beautiful love story with an anti-war message. I feel Miyazaki san is right to have Sophie as a not-so-pretty girl in the movie rather than somebody lovely like in the book. OK, it makes me feel good that at the end of the day, the kindness of Sophie ie the inner beauty, overcame superficial look. Howl's character in the movie is also more interesting and I thought the the producer made the right choice of having Takuya Kimura to provide the voice-over for Howl's character. It makes him really attractive and fascinating. Somebody wrote that that Howl's character might bring in the female audience like Haku character did in 'Spirited Away'. I must say that person could be right. I was in Kinokuniya a few weeks ago, looking at the Japanese books of Howl. There was this girl with her kid brother also looking at the same books and she commented to him that all her friends like Howl. I thought that was pretty funny considering that Howl is an animated character and not a real person. But Takuya Kimura really breathed life into Howl making him into a sort of devil-may-care, sometime brooding, sometime rascally, good looking wizard who is swoon-worthy, thanks to the animated artists."
someflightlessbirds,"May 6, 2024",7/10,"I feel like Ghibli is at its best when it's simple in structure and it's overall goals, but it gives plenty of room for the viewer to explore on their own. Films like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away are great examples of this. But while Howls Moving Castle is certainly ambitious and has a lot to say, the way it's presented ends up being a jumbled mess.The first half of the film is relatively straightforward and has a good idea of what it's going for, but as it continues, it feels more confused with itself. Playing devils advocate, it is based on a book, so I would understand if it's not up to par with its adaptation. However, I think that a film adaptation of a book should act on its own without solely relying on its original material in order to make sense of things. And there are so many moving proponents within the story that it leaves more questions than answers, and not in a good way either.But one thing that really annoys me is how one of my friends (a Ghibli fan) gets mad at me whenever she's reminded of the score I gave this, even though everyone in my social group admits that it gets confusing in the second half. As of writing this review, I'm giving it a 7/10 (though it might go down to a 6/10), which is a good score. I do enjoy the film overall, but I just find it irritating that people point out flaws of their favorite film, and yet expect you to give it a higher score anyways. If there's an aspect how a storyline is presented in terms of pacing and world building that throws me off, I'm obviously not going to enjoy it to the full extent of some die hard fans.But even with its issues, I still think it's an okay film. I just think that Ghibli has done better."
emilfroom,"Nov 8, 2022",7/10,"This movie left me with a lot of confusion. Miyazaki is a great director and I love his work but in my opinion this is not his best.The plot line is very strange and kind of all over the place. I think we need a little more backstory to a whole lot. Like Sophie's curse, i don't understand why she even was cursed at all. Then her age changes throughout the movie (which I love) but what causes that change. And all the characters have no backstory at all, like the witches who are they and why are they mad and the little boy what's the deal with him. I also wanted more knowledge about the war like what is that about.I think that the movie have parts missing from the story however I love the scenery and the mindset of the characters. The first half is so good, it is not as rushed as the second half. And the ending is beautiful with all the characters finding their way. IA movie worth seeing but I find much of Miyazakis other work better. And some of the artwork you would just love as a painting."
tary,"Jan 6, 2006",8/10,"I haven't seen too many of Miyazaki's movies (besides Spirited Away and Totoro), but this sure beats any Disney productions. The movie was thoroughly enjoyable, though it employs too many tricks from the director's previous works. For those who have seen Spirited Away, I find too many similarities between it & Howl's Moving Castle. I can't remember the name of the dragon wizard in Spirited Away but I feel that Howl is like an adult version of the dragon wizard. For instance, both are ""trapped"" by some form of evil forces and risk turning into demons. the whole plot was also a tad too confusing. I had to watch it twice to grasp the full meaning. (and even after that, I'm not sure I really do understand it). I therefore won't recommend it to young viewers. One wonderful surprise after i finished watching the movie was that the charming Japanese actor Takuya Kimura was actually the voice for Howl. And I so regret not paying enough attention to Howl's voice. That's one reason why you should always watch the original version of the movie."
tommyknockers-1,"Jun 12, 2005",10/10,"I loved just about every second of Howl's Moving Castle, but I can understand why some folks had problems with it.1. Several visual ideas reappear from Miyazaki's other films - blob men, flying machines, laser-pointer crystals, and so forth. Still, nothing feels recycled or rehashed. The referential nods just encourage the notion of a cohesive Miyazaki universe - that all his stories chronicle different periods of a single imaginary world where just about anything is possible. I especially appreciated the Ghibli references since Howl's is rumored to be Miyazaki's final film - this made the experience all the most sentimental and bittersweet, especially when combined with the ""what it means to grow old"" subplot.If Sophie feels all too familiar to you - consider this: there is an inside joke at Studio Ghibli that a single imaginary anime actress plays all of Miyazaki's different heroines.While Howl's Moving Castle is certainly not the first Charles-Dickens-high-on-absinthe-and-anachronism anime I've ever seen - its the only one that spiritually takes that Old World European ""turn of the century"" feeling to Sgt.-Pepper's heights.2. Howl's Moving Castle lacks a traditional narrative plot in favor of presenting a surreal, dream-like experience. The story itself does not suffer from this treatment. It's still a very interesting tale - it just might take some folks a couple of screenings to really get it. The final resolve comes about thanks to a sort-of deux ex machina, followed by some Scooby-Doo worthy revelations. Its a ruthlessly, beautifully, absurdly happy ending that knows very well just how ridiculous it is, and pushes it as far as it can go - but this perfectly follows the film's dream-logic. To claim that Howl's Moving Castle doesn't make a whole lot of sense it to miss the point entirely.I can't vouch for the book - but unless it was written with Miyazaki in mind - many changes must have been made.A handful of traditions from other fantasy classics are represented - yet all the while, the film feels totally original.Its a surreal, dream-like experience - you just have to let yourself go with it. I felt like I was 10 years old again, you get that same overwhelming sense of wonder. In a single word, the film is supremely MAGICAL. Although I'm still in my 20's, the subplot concerning what you lose, and what you gain with old age really got to me. Of course, the visuals are jaw-dropping, esp. the kinetic sense of motion - the way Howl's Castle moves, the way characters' faces morph - its all beyond words. Plus, its hilarious, with a kind of grandparent sense of humor. So many classic moments. And it can be very unsettling at times, esp. during the passages where everything seems too good to be true, we keep waiting for the earth to drop out from underneath. I love the way Miyazaki's heroes accept their doom, and just move on. Its like, ""Hey - what do you know?...I aged 70 years when I woke up this morning, oh well, that sucks, guess I better head off for the mountains."" I feel I should warn you - Sophie's mom comes across like Scarlet O'Hara on bad acid!I entered the theater expecting to be a little bit disappointed - how could it top Spirited Away? - maybe that's why I was so pleasantly surprised.Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect Miyazaki movie.PS - I did eat one brownie, but by Act II, it felt like I head eaten four."
RubyMouse,"Jun 16, 2018",8/10,There are lovely touches of understated humour throughout this beautiful looking film which reflect the tone of original story really well. It is also suitable for watching with children without boring yourself silly.
