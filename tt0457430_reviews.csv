Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 6, 2023",9/10,"1944, Spain, Ofelia accompanied her mother to meet up with her father, who happens to be a Captain in The Spanish Army, there Ofelia escapes into a nightmarish world, and must complete three horrifying challenges.It took me one or two viewings to fully get it, and to appreciate it, but I'm glad I did, Pan's Labyrinth is an incredible movie, it's one that will appeal to horror fans, and those that enjoy surreal stories and fantasies.Plenty of messaging to loon out for, you have to wait to learn exactly what's going on, it's worth waiting for.Beautifully acted and stunningly produced, it's a glorious looking film, I think it's aged incredibly well.Personally my favourite scene is the dinner table, Ofelia chomps down a few grapes, whilst a terrifying being wakes up, what a scene.Only from the mind of Guillermo del Toro is this possible.9/10."
j30bell,"Nov 23, 2006",9/10,"Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell; can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica; or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.For all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth, which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death  a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year, and a must see on the big screen."
adamonIMDb,"Feb 4, 2018",9/10,"Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s."
EVON1TY,"Mar 2, 2023",10/10,"I know not everyone should like this movie as I am. I actually don't like this type of Fantasies. I like Fantasy movies that are belong to another Fictional Universe. Making a Fantasy movie in our world were not a great idea for me. But this movie shows you the real world, makes you feel the reality and all the bad things in the world. Then shows you a great land, I don't know like a Heaven. You're traveling one to another. You're seeing another aspect all the time.That is why this movie is so unique. It doesn't bring you another world. Bring the another world to your world. And somehow It manages to doing that so perfectly.Not only these but this movie has amazing fictonal characters. The terrifying villain, the innocent daughter that deserves to see miracles, the mother that doesn't have a choice, the creatures with unique visuals.Acting, costumes, makeups, editing are pretty good. But the Screenplay, Scores and Cinematography are just brilliant. Totally worth to see, you'll see another type of Fantasy with this movie."
mizhelenuk,"Aug 27, 2006",10/10,"I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 8, 2017",10/10,"An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after ""The Rite of Spring"" because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism."
dontslityourwrist_yet,"Dec 14, 2006",10/10,"This is a movie with a simple and straightforward plot which contains layers and layers of intelligent writing, metaphors and message.To speak further about the script will end up in spoilers and that would be pointless since my very purpose writing this review is to encourage people to see it.This is no small feat, interpreting fantasy as something of a product of a real world, cross-referencing how the child acts to her real surroundings and the ""other world"", metaphors that describe the accelerated state of growing up some of us are put through... Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.Those who are saying how it's predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren't predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It's not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you've ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It's always about how well you tell a story.I'm grateful there are still directors who aren't tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.Pan's Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.I am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its' original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.This is a brilliant movie. Watch it."
dante_leebo,"Aug 25, 2006",9/10,"I was fortunate enough to catch Pan's Labyrinth last night as part of the 'Fright Fest' programme in London and was completely blown away. Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type of person who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. This does not open until 24 November in the UK and 29 December in the USA but already I am looking forward to seeing it again (and buying the Special Edition DVD).This is the first time I've felt the need to write a review on here. Do yourselves a favour and go and watch it on the big screen."
allan-117,"Sep 12, 2006",10/10,"Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole ""20min ovation at Cannes"" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it's an amazing work.Skipping the plot recap (find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in), I'll go straight to the tech specs. I'm not a huge Del Toro fan, Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here, the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance, that doesn't tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama, part fantasy, part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy, it still enchants.Sergi Lopez and Maribel Verdú really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven't seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon, in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes, the head housekeeper (or something) who is Ofelia's closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia, her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.When the fairy tale elements return, it's astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.One thing that most reviews haven't mentioned is the violence. I think it's been firmly established that this is an adult's fairytale, but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don't seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish, it may get a bit much for you.A final and obvious point I spose I can't get away without making: the set design, costumes and effects are superb. That's all.I was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy, but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn't a false note anywhere or a plot hole, which are too often present in fantasy films. I can't recall a good, original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn't share any of the contrivances, vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.I just wish I'd seen it without already having read so much. I've tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I'd urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately, and try not to read too much more."
zetes,"Jan 21, 2007",7/10,"I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too."
stob88,"Feb 6, 2007",6/10,"I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDb ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if its adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies."
johanloenn,"Apr 11, 2007",3/10,"It is really interesting that a movie so enjoyed by some viewers can be so annoying for others. This is my general impression when I read reviews on IMDb. Pan's Labyrinth (PL) is the most typical example when it's completely incomprehensible for me how a movie can be so highly rated. The only amazing aspect of this movie is that so many viewers find it so great. OK, for sure it's visually beautiful and unusual in terms of story-telling technique, but the story is so unpleasant, one-dimensional and pointless that I just to wanted to get away from the cinema (which almost never happens).Since I do not understand how anyone can find this movie enjoying, I will just try help you people who get disturbed by the same movie elements as myself. So if you often find the following aspects annoying in movies you should be careful before buying a ticket to this one.* Over-simplification of evil through characters that are extremely bad for no obvious reason (black or white - no gray scales)* Extreme violence that is completely pointless and makes you feel sick* Sympathetic characters that you are supposed to sympathize with immediately without really getting to know them* Two parallel story-paths (fantasy vs reality), none of which has any absorbing plot, and are completely unrelated to each other during most of the movieNormally I hate when people express their anger and give a 1 star rating because they hate a movie that everyone else finds so great, so the only good thing about PL is that I can at least start to understand how people can become so angry with a so called cinematic masterpiece.PS. My interpretation is that PL is a movie for artistic people that enjoy getting emotional through fuzzy fairy tales about good and evil, whereas it is not a movie for thinking people that wants to attain a higher understanding of the good and evil in man with some structure and logical congruence in the end. OK, PL actually has some congruence in the end, but this doesn't save a movie that is simply repugnant from start to finish."
davidcapa,"Oct 12, 2006",10/10,"I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi López, Maribel Verdú and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro."
ThreeSpoons82,"Sep 15, 2006",9/10,"I saw this at this years FrightFest Film Festival in London and absolutely loved it.Guillermo was there to introduce it and you can tell it really is a film he loves and is passionate about.He referred to it as a sister movie to The Devils Backbone.Anyway . . . so the film starts and I must admit I was expecting a lot more of a fantasy film however it is more of a 70/30 split between historical era movie/fantasy fairytale.Don't let this put you off though, the film really is stunning and brilliantly acted. The little girl carries pretty much the whole film on her shoulders and does so with the skill of Atlas himself!The violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but it is probably one of the most gorgeous and personal films from a director for a long time!Give it a go if you can get to a screening, DON'T WAIT FOR DVD, it really does need to be seen on a big screen!"
luckyfay,"Jun 19, 2006",9/10,"I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.In my opinion, del Toro's ""...Labyrinth"" deserved to win at Cannes over the Ken Loach film, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". Actually, everyone I knew at the Festival who had seen both agreed with me. And the 22 minute ovation speaks clearly for the effect on the audience. It's hard to imagine that any film could beat it in a context other than Cannes where they have marked preferences, bordering on obsession, for certain directors.Let's hope that the late December opening favors an Oscar nomination which it should win hands down, unless some other work of genius appears on the horizon. That doesn't seem likely because at Cannes the somewhat disappointing array of films was attributed to the fact that not much great product is being released this year. I might add that I had already seen Volver prior to Pan's Labyrinth, and I maintain that Pan is the better film. For me, it displaced all three of my top films of the year. I do love The Departed but, luckily, that's in another category which does not threaten Pan's access to Oscar. If I had to choose the very best picture of the year, without limitation by category, it would most assuredly go to Pan's Labyrinth for it demonstrates del Toro's originality and brilliance as both writer and director."
zetas-1,"Sep 4, 2006",10/10,"It is Guillermo del Toro's best film ( 22 minutes ovation at Cannes). Del Toro gets a brilliant film but also superb performances from all involved, particularly from Sergi Lopez as a brutal Fascist army captain Vidal and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy) as the Pan and the wonderfully disturbing Pale Man. But the real find is Ivana Baquero (12 years old) as the young heroine Ofelia. She gives one of the best performances from a child actor we have seen since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Come to it unprepared and with your mind wide open and you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the year."""
Galina_movie_fan,"May 26, 2007",6/10,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"".One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"".I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"".I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is much more deserving than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to."
zgamer-1,"May 23, 2007",10/10,"I just finished the movie today and I must say that this is by far one of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have seen in years. The producers of the film were right to call this a modern fairytale, since it has all the ingredients for an authentic Brothers Grimm story. Just don't expect there to be lots of happy faces in the film. This is a real, bloody (very bloody), moody, emotional fairy tale just like the ones in the past.First of all, I have to say that the technical design in this film was astounding. The art direction was spot on for all the locations, whether its the imaginary world of the labyrinth or the mill that the fascists call their base. The music is some of the best I've heard in a film for a long time, drawing that fantasy feel of the movie perfectly and inspiring so many emotions in one chord than other films could in their whole screening. The sound was top notch as well, never sounding like just a compilation of reused sound effects. And of course, the make-up design is flawless and imaginative. The biggest shock was the cinematography. Now, I personally thought Children of Men should have got the Oscar for this, but understand now why this won. Each shot is beautifully staged, colored and detailed in a way that they cease to be movie shots and become portraits of art.Guillermo Del Toro really surprised me. Not only did he assemble a surprisingly talented cast, but he was able to make you really connect with the situation. The characters are all well developed and the symbolism, though subtle, is so delicious that it makes me tingle with the thought of it. The dialogue is natural and authentic and he handles the film expertly to convey that timeless feel even through some of the film's harsher moments. You really feel this is a labor of love, since it bears its fruits at every scene. I didn't even mind that I had to read subtitles (which I think Del Toro knew that he would have to use it wisely, since the scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading the text to enjoy the scene).If I had any complaints, its that some of the visual effect designs were sometimes inferior. They weren't bad, but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed.I recommend this for anyone who has a strong stomach, an eye for art and a heart. It deserved all its Oscar wins and noms and should have won for its amazing music. This is the new standard for film art for the modern generation."
Kirpianuscus,"Dec 23, 2015",N/A,"one of films who becomes an important experience. because it is, in same measure, a special war film and a fairy tale illustration. wise translation of idea of fiction as refuge against cruelty of every day life and homage to innocence. a great director. an extraordinary young actress. a story who mix fears, joy and need of measure in ambiguous world. a film like a poem. bitter, cold, touching, profound, necessary. because it is a precise exploration of life's purpose. because it is delicate and bitter and soft. a film about a war and a not ordinary, at the first sigh, manner to survive. one of films who becomes a personal memory. because it is a trip in your secret universe. and rediscover of unique colors from a special age."
brenttraft,"Jan 12, 2007",6/10,"There is no debating that ""Pan's Labrynth"" is a well made movie, but it is so relentlessly violent, sadistic, and depressing; that I could not enjoy it.Judging by the popularity of this film on this website and the professional reviews, apparently the amount of sadistic violence does not bother most people. I have certainly been able to sit though my share, but this film was so repulsive that I cannot say I had a good time watching it.I go to the movies to be entertained, not repulsed. ""Pan's Labrynth"" certainly has many attributes, but don't say I didn't warn you. If you like films like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel,"" the violence will not bother you. If you are squeamish, you should stay away."
williejk,"Feb 18, 2016",9/10,"Playing moments of true wonderment off scenes of sadistic brutality, Guillermo del Toro has created an epithet for classical fairy tales reminiscent of the traditional stories which amazed - yet simultaneously frightened - children.Del Toro offers us two worlds through the perspective of young Ofelia. The first - reality - is the cruelty of Franco's Spain; where Ofelia is whisked away to her sadistic step-father (played brilliantly by Sergi Lopez) who is attempting to root out the last remnants of the Republic. The second - fantasy - is the underground kingdom - or more precisely the promise of such a world - as Ofelia must complete three tasks for the beautifully constructed faun in order to prove her worth of being a part of such a utopia. What elevates Pan's Labyrinth above other fantasises, however, is the fact that its reality sequences are just as intriguing as its fantasy elements - a rare feat - and the two meld together perfectly.For instance, the faun may offer interestingly ambiguous revelations about Ofelia's destiny, but only if she follows his orders. Yet he doesn't necessarily mean what he says, and the presence of the Fascists in Ofelia's reality suggests that blindly following orders is the complete opposite of what she should do. So, while there are trips into the magical world (including a disturbing yet inherently memorable scene with the hieronymus bosch-like spectre known as the 'Pale Man') they do not overwhelm the film.The true horror and the meat of the story lies in Falangist Spain with the menacing Captain Vidal, who takes delight in torture - ritually preparing his tool kit and reciting his own speech to demoralise his victims - and who is equally obsessed with the continuation of his bloodline. The fantasy world is indeed where Ofelia's lessons are learned so that she may confront the terrors of reality; the most important of which being the need for courageous disobedience in the face of extreme oppression. Pan's Labyrinth therefore successfully and perfectly captures the essence of classical children's literature; combining fantasy with moments of horror, all with an underlying and ultimately crucial message which we must take head of in reality. The final scene is also a true whopper; with a killer of a send-off line and an ambiguous ending which still fuels debates to this day.Thankfully, del Toro uses CGI sparingly, although it is very obvious when it is used (particularly in the case of the giant toad) but this doesn't detract from the film's overall brilliance. It's dark, at times disturbing, but nevertheless beautiful, a true Gothic tale if there ever was one."
ejavignon,"Feb 28, 2007",10/10,"The negative reviews of this film on IMDb seem to fall into two categories: a) it was too violent b) the fantasy element was too mutedWithout getting too political, worse things are going on in the world at this very moment than were depicted in this film. While many people prefer entertainment that insulates them from the harsh realities of this world, one shouldn't get so indignant when a film portrays the world for what it is. Capitán Vidal was a fictitious character, but there are plenty of people exactly like him. Humans are capable of terrible atrocities and looking the other way does nothing to improve our nature. If violence offends people so much they should do something about real violence rather than writing nasty reviews about depictions of it.The violence set a tone of desperation for Ofelia. Fairy tales themselves are extremely violent, and Disney cartoons are nothing like the stories they were based on. This film was rated R. What were you expecting?It is easier to understand people who thought the fantasy element was eclipsed, and were maybe hoping for another Narnia or one of the other countless fantasy flicks that has come out in the wake of LOTR. This film touched on many of the most fundamental themes of mythology, such as parallel worlds, dangerous tasks, hidden identities, sacrifice, and death. It did something more than the standard fantasy movie, which is part of why it was such a great film."
damianphelps,"Sep 12, 2020",8/10,"This film has such a unique style and essence, its beautiful and magical as much as it is ugly and harsh.I have never seen a movie quite like this one, I went into it not knowing much about it (I had seen the hands with eyes but that was about it) so it was very much a sense of discovery as the tale and the fantasy unfolded before me.Way more violent than I would have guessed but the story is brutal and cruel so it is fitting.If you are into the art-form of film (not just a movie buff) then this is a must watch."
TheLittleSongbird,"May 19, 2009",10/10,"Don't let the fact that it is in Spanish throw you. This is a dark, moving and sometimes terrifying masterpiece of a film. Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."
bob the moo,"Jan 24, 2007",N/A,"Carmen has married Captain Vidal and, pregnant with his son, travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man, perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the ""smallest cinema on earth"" (it wasn't but it must have been close). Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which, contrary to the marketing, is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging real-world horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where, like the real world, she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but, as much as I want to see this, it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story (although less so the real parts) and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the ""horror"" part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door (in the UK this was rated a 15). At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story (again specifically the fantasy).By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue (albeit subtitled) interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative, such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too, drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. López could have hammed it up but, while he doesn't really make a person here, he avoids being a pantomime baddie. Verdú is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered, I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it."

tomhbrand,"Dec 14, 2006",10/10,"Guillermo del Toro how to tell a real fairy tale. A fairy tale that isn't all princesses, princes, magical fairies and happy endings. It might have them, but the point that has been sanitised out of fairy tales over the last century or so is the fact that they were originally cautionary tales for children, handed down through generations of oral tradition to teach children what life is. And what is the one fact that children should learn as soon as possible? That life is nasty!Laberinto del Fauno (titled Pan's Labyrinth here, though no mention is ever made to the faun in the film being Pan) is the story of Ofelia, a little girl forced to move with her pregnant mother to rural Spain to be near her step-father, a Captain in the fascist army during the Spanish Civil War. As she experiences first hand the horrors of war and fascism, she enters an ancient maze and meets a faun who tells her she is a lost Princess of an underground kingdom and must pass three tests to claim her place there.I will admit that I went into this film expecting a nice, children friendly movie, but del Toro pulls no punches when it comes to the war, a war he experienced as a child. It's hard sometimes to decide what was more important to the director; Ofelia's story, or whether that was just a backdrop to highlight all the more the cruelty and brutality of the war.There are no Indiana Jones style comedy Nazis here, the fascists are truly evil and we see it. Both the violence (which is just graphic enough to prevent us from being able to ignoring it without ever being gratuitous) and the mindsets of the people involved. What is more disturbing that any of the on screen actions is the attitude of 'pull the ladder up jack, I'm alright' of those who find themselves in privileged positions. Ariadna Gil, as Ofelia's mother showcases this perfectly. She knows full well what Vidal thinks of her only as a vessel for him unborn son, and that he probably killed Ofelia's father, but she never seems to resent him. Neither does she ever seem to love him. What you get is more a kind of relief, she knows that as long as he has a use for her she and her daughter are safe. It's purely self preservation, to know your place and survive, and that is more disturbing to me than anything else in the film.Sometimes it's even almost as if Ofelia's quest is the subplot, as even fantastical tales of giant toads, fauns, a magical kingdom, the Pale Man (a horrific creature with it's eye in its hands) pale into insignificance when we're faced with the true life horrors that we see mankind inflict upon itself.And that's one of the most interesting aspects of the story. Even as everything goes on around her, as the Civil War rages around her, her mothers life lies in Captain Vidal hands, what can the innocent do. Ofelia is not part of this world, she hasn't had a hand in creating it and she does not have a hand in affecting it's outcome. The faun and his quests are, to her at least, far more important as they are something that she is involved in, that are about her.On the technical side this is a beautifully crafted film. The cinematography and sets are wonderful, never once setting a difference between the real and the fantasy. Both aspects of the film seem just as important to del Toro, some directors would have favoured one or the other sides of the story and that would have made the film unbalanced.It's clearly influenced by many fairy tales, and a nice touch is, like many movie fairy tales, we never certain whether the fantasy is real. Is Ofelia really a lost princess from a magical kingdom, or are all her adventures and meetings purely from her imagination, one of the stories she tells to her unborn brother expanded to protect her from the nightmares of real life? What Guillermo del Toro has done with this film is to create a beautiful fairy tale masterpiece that harks back to the days when fairy tales were told around a fire to scare children, not read at bedtime to put them to sleep. But despite what I said earlier about this not being a children's film, take some to see it and I still think they'd enjoy it, even if it was from behind the cushion."
foysol,"May 7, 2007",7/10,First lets start with the 20 minute standing ovation this film supposedly got at Cannes. After watching the film I don't believe it. Someone must have exaggerated the length of time by at least 18 minutes. That or those apparently ecstatic people were drunk. Don't get me wrong this is a good film. But the praise this is getting from critics and people writing here is way over the top. I was fully expecting a work of real vision and/or originality but what I experienced was a film that borrows from other films and admittedly gels everything together into a cohesive and impressive whole. A lot of great films do the same but 'Pans Labrynth' has other faults that prevent it from being put in the same category as the truly great films.'Pans Labrynth' at times is too predictable - a side effect from borrowing from other films - therefore some scenes feel clichéd. Also the tasks the girl has to complete in order to take her place as princess could have been more imaginatively realized. Finally the message/point/allegory of the film is trite and simplistic. Still worth watching but is this really one of the top 100 films of all time? Not even close...
jlborras,"Aug 16, 2025",10/10,"One of my favorite movies of all time!When it came out in theaters, it was a family affair for us: my wife, daughter, and I saw it I don't know how many times!I owned it on DVD, then blu-ray, and now 4K.I know some people don't digest that mixture of fantasy and realism, but it's all a matter of opinion and individual taste.Those of you who have not seen it, don't judge it by negative reviews. See it and then make up your mind. I have recommended it to many people I know, and they simply didn't like it.Like the saying goes: ""to each its own""."
beatrice_gangi,"Sep 22, 2022",10/10,"When I first saw the movie, I must not have been very far from the age of the protagonist. I rejoiced because I too had tried many times to open magic doors with pencils. And I was terribly afraid of the banquet-keeper for months. Even though I was a child and even though I was made uncomfortable by the atmosphere of the movie, I could not tear myself away from it, as no child can tear his eyes away from a fairy world.Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful and sad story, a fairy tale that perfectly captures what it means to be a child in a crude world. What Guillermo del Toro has managed to bring to the screen comes close to being magic. The atmospheres are unique and haunting, the music is wonderful. There is nothing in this film that does not stick in the depths of your soul."
tedg,"Jan 27, 2007",N/A,"I get annoyed at movies that preach one thing and are themselves another.The story here has two components, a real and fantasy thread. The real world thread is simple. By that I mean there are no dramatic complications at all. The characters are theatrical cartoons. The situation starts out brutally and stays that way without any arc, development, evolution. It is in fact a formula movie, this thread, and one that follows a formula that is based on strict, strict boundaries. One would suspect it was written by a German, it is so regimented. One would almost believe it to be written by ""The Captain,"" the bad guy here.It marches. Its unambiguous. Its final and brutal in its morality, just as the Captian is. There are only good and bad people and the bad are not only very, very bad but they get their deserts. Justice isn't nuanced here. In fact nothing at all is.I suppose people celebrate it for its fantasy thread. Yes, the effects are good. Yes the creepy eyeless man was creepy. Yes the Tinkerbells were Tinkerbelly. But is this in any way better than ""Dark Crystal,"" which was similarly banal in its cosmology?Look, I'm one of the ones who get depressed at things like ""The Matrix,"" but if lacking in imagination, is copying was deep, complex, manylayered. This is something that Franco would have written, and little fascist parents would have trotted to, because its all about absolutes and the inability of humans to be rich, subtle, varied beings.The best we can do, is be ""innocent.""I often can see some good in any film. But not this one. The world is too close to intolerant extremism as it is. Don't feed it by supporting this.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

Buddy-51,"Feb 24, 2007",7/10,"One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.There's no denying that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of ""Das Boot.""Yet, for all its good points, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga or ""The Wizard of Oz."" We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.Thus, although the parts in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable."
mathias-19,"Oct 3, 2010",6/10,"After reading all the positive reviews and being a great fan of Maribel Verdu (since her role in ""Amantes""), I had great expectations before seeing this movie. Quite honestly, I was disappointed. The characters lack depth. All falangistas are incredibly bad and sadistic, and all nationalists republicans are good in this movie. Stereotypic. If Del Toro wanted to make Capitan Vidal really terrifying, he would have made a little bit more sympathetic at times, like ""Landa"" in Inglourious Basterds - probably the most terrifying nazi ever on the silver screen. Vidal could at least have been a little bit concerned for his wife when she was bearing his unborn son. But now, he is a facha macho, so he can not show emotions at any time. Even the symbolism of the labyrinth is too easy : especially the end, where the self sacrifice of Ofelia is a clear sign of a Messias, including the invitation to sit at the right hand of her father in a sort of a pagan Trinity (with her mother). The cinematography however is wonderful and the actor perform well, but the scenario is just too shallow for my taste."

Colorful and evocative cinematography by Guillermo Navarro , Del Toro's usual .The motion picture was splendidly directed by Guillermo del Toro who even gave up his entire salary , including back-end points, to see this film become realized . In 2007, this film became one of the few fantasy films ever nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Oscars . The film was hailed by critics and audiences alike, and del Toro decided to give Hollywood another try .

SnoopyStyle,"Apr 27, 2014",9/10,It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel Verdú. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential. The violence can be brutal. It's like a fairy tale fantasy got mixed up with a horror movie.
gjg304,"Nov 20, 2006",10/10,"Guillermo del Toro thinks his latest production to be his best to date, and perfectly describes it as ""a powerfully moving story, profoundly human and dramatic."" Throughout the film there is a contrast between the fairytale land that the young Ofelia is mixed up in and the brutal goings on of the Spanish Civil War that surround her. One minute fairies flutter around her face, and the next minute we see her step father - ""el capitán"" - shooting two suspected propagandists at point blank range. The acting is very powerful throughout, with the perfect balance of innocence and enquiry from young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, and a very convincing 'baddie' in Sergi López's Capitán Vidal, seeming to show absolutely no love for anything or anyone, other than his future child who he is sure will be a son - when the doctor says that it is not certain the baby will be male, the Captain replies 'no me jodas' (don't f*** with me). The film is beautiful from start to finish, with CGI perfectly fusing with the real rural images of a lodge deep in the forest. The film uses the horrific nature of the war to give added power without becoming overly politicised, for which del Toro must be commended. Overall a fantastic piece of film-making, and I look forward to seeing it again."

CineCritic2517,"Feb 8, 2007",1/10,"I stuck around for this movie to serve something not yet seen or experienced in dozens of related films which I was so sure this movie would provide. Sadly, that moment never came.Although I have no complaints with the acting and setdesigns which were on par with any quality movie, there are basically three things that deprive this movie of being anything great.1. Though truly beautifully shot, Pan's two sided scenario with the Good vs Evil Children's-picture on the one side and a drama/war-movie on the other, provides no deeper layers. A 'what you see is what you get' type of film in which the fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice on the adverts in combination with a superabundance of very graphic violence in a foreign movie which offers a subterfuge to sell something slight and cursory as profound and insightful.2. Since there is no thread running through both the scenario's it is like watching two different movies which bear very little to each other nor compliment the other. Because I liked the fantasy part zealously better than the war/drama bit, I was very disappointed that it had no follow-through and that it in the end just seemed like a shameless cloned-off short-impression of movies like Alice in Wonderland, The Wizzard of Ozz and The never Ending Story, to name but a few, but never with a meaningful reference of any kind. It is almost like the writers hit behind the fact that they never even saw these movies.3.There is just nothing subtle in the story that draws you in, I found it all annoyingly superficial and cliché. It never invites you to share the little girl's fantastic world or truly reject El Capitan's actions because it is all far too black and white. Plus the film leaves no room for any other interpretation aside from the one which is already painted elaborately on its cinematic walls. Something I find quite odd since most true children's pictures have a lot underlying messages and symbolism. The more I think about it, the more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it. -In the end of it all, there is simply no hope-..nothing more than a flipflop of any and all sappy-happy-endings Hollywood has been laying on us for years on end.Furthermore, with style over substance as its forté the movie tends to plod tremendously at times. And since none of the characters are really focused on, they all just seem to be stereotypes and are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their (too) obvious good or bad demeanors. Vidal is simply bad, mom is simply weak and Ofelia was nothing more than the little girl playing with imaginary friends in the corner of the room.This film is alas just another example of a movie where they just don't seem to be able to get it both ways (powerful story AND powerful cinematography) which is the Achilles' heel of many a film lately but which oddly doesn't seem to bother the average moviegoer nor professional movie-critic who somehow seem to think that foreign+different=Masterpiece."

musback,"Dec 8, 2006",10/10,"it was fan-tas-tic! I truly loved the magical touch in this movie. The movie is actually a combination of 2 very strong stories; a fantasy journey and a rather brutal Spanish war. Both stories blend perfectly! The acting is very good, very natural and the Spanish language makes the fantastic characters sound like they speak enchanted dead languages (if you don't speak Spanish of course :o) It differentiates itself from other movies because of this because there are no cheesy ""i love you""-lines or tough American style WarHeroism-language.The magic isn't childish at all, it's more of a mature nature, very dark and can be very scary/spooky (like in Brothers Grimm). Believe me, Watch this movie, you WILL NOT REGRET IT. either if you like fantasy or a strong war-story, just let your eyes feast on this masterpiece.one of my all-time favorites."
dbranan,"Feb 20, 2007",10/10,"After seeing the film, and after reading many of the comments, I would like to say something about the violence that has attracted so much attention.This film is violent, but not in the adolescent vein of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Saw"" or other similar films. It is violent in a realistic manner that counterbalances the fantasy portion of the story in a non-gratuitous way. All the violent scenes are entirely appropriate to the telling of the story, although many of them are difficult to watch. What you won't see are fountains of gore and exploding body parts. The fact is that people don't explode in a burst of red mist when shot with a military-caliber luger. This is not cartoon/video game violence.The CGI is done in an understated way that enhances the realism of the movie, rather than detracting from it. This is probably the single best use of GGI that I have ever seen. You truly walk away wondering if much of what you just saw was actually real.I have read comments disdaining the creatures in this film, but I think these people have entirely missed the point. The fantasy scenes, although some of them are disturbing, are almost charming in their child-like simplicity. They are rooted in the fears and imagination of a young girl, not the jaded mind of an adult. As such, they are frightening only in a ""monster under the bed"" sort of way.Finally, I would encourage anyone who loves fantasy films to see Pan's Labyrinth. I would not recommend it for any child under the age of 16, though I think that only the most mature 16-year olds should see it. It is a thought-provoking film that will haunt you for days afterward."
carb-5,"Apr 8, 2007",10/10,"This movie is a Mexican-Spanish co-production and in my opinion a Guillermo Del Toro 's masterpiece. If we defined a masterpiece as a content or form who finds an adequate expression in an art form then this movie is one . There are so many things to talk about but let's start with the photography that have an outstanding quality , it's almost like paintings . The screenplay unite 2 separate worlds , the world of fantasy and the post war era in Spain in a very wise way. Being Spanish myself I recognize many of the things the screenplay talks about . The actors and actresses do a once in a lifetime performances , for me this movie is a casting miracle . Ivana Baquero, Maribel Verdú ( in a performance full of dignity and courage), Sergi Lopez ( his fascist is a terrible character but he gives him humanity ).The music score by Javier Navarrete is full of subtle details and good orchestration .And the movie never takes the easy way , it's full of logic and good storytelling . A truly great movie that one cannot miss, be in cinemas or DVD."
mstomaso,"Jun 18, 2007",10/10,"Very early in this film, I formed an interpretation which I believe to be completely correct, and borne out by the plot, details, and symbolism in the film. I will not share that interpretation here. All that I will say about it is that despite knowing where the film would end up and why, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, and was surprised by many aspects of the film along the way.Written and directed by rising Mexican directorial star Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is set in Spain during the Franco years. The story's heroine is a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the story is told mostly from her perspective. Ofelia lives in two worlds, the miserable abomination that Spain has become under fascist control, and a world of magic in which she has learned that she may just be a reincarnated princess who has to undergo a series of trials posed by the faun 'Pan' prior to being reunited after several hundred years with her father, the king. These two worlds come together at several points in the narrative, where Ofelia needs the magic of Pan's world to resolve problems in her other realm.Ofelia's other realm is populated by her pregnant mother, who is the only parent she has known, her reluctantly adoptive father (the father of the child her mother is to bear), who is a fascist commanding an outpost in which they reside. There are several other prominent characters including members of a resistance movement a caring housekeeper and a doctor employed by the fascists.The acting is all excellent, especially the heavy (Sergi Lopez), Ofelia, and Mercedes the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu). But the story and the exceptional fluidity with which the camera and sound tell it are the real stars here. There are no wasteful scenes in this film though, to be sure there are some painful and disturbing ones.Although I have enjoyed some of Del Toro's work previously, this is the most serious, intense, and well made film I have thus far seen from him. Everything about this perfectly coherent film works, from both an aesthetic and practical point of view. Pan's Labyrinth has reached my top 5 for 2006.Very highly recommended."
chriss17eu,"Dec 9, 2025",6/10,"I'd always been told 'Pan's Labyrinth' was a masterpiece, but after finally watching it, I feel it's a good film that simply wasn't what I expected. A lot of that disappointment comes from the imbalance between what the movie promises to be and what it actually delivers.Sergi López is phenomenal. His performance is brutal, razor-sharp, and practically carries the entire film on its shoulders. The depiction of Francoist Spain is suffocating, violent, and painfully real - genuinely terrifying.And it's precisely because the political side is so strong that the fantasy feels pushed into the background, almost sidelined. I expected a story fully driven by dark fantasy with a war backdrop, but that's not the direction Del Toro takes. Instead, the fantasy appears in symbolic flashes, tied to the protagonist's psychology, rarely exploring what could have been a fully realized, inhuman world filled with extraordinary creatures. I was hoping for an explosion of creativity and breathtaking environments, but I ended up feeling the fantasy was surprisingly shallow. Sure, the Pale Man is iconic, but these moments are brief, and the ""beyond"" is barely developed.I finished the movie asking myself: Where is the labyrinth?"
Theo Robertson,"Apr 22, 2014",8/10,"PAN'S LABYRINTH was just about the most critically acclaimed release of 2006 . While it was better than most of the films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar - can anyone remember THE QUEEN or BABEL ? - it suffered badly from the hype and acclaim that surrounded it . Watching it not long after its release I did get a feeling of slight disappointment of "" Is that it ? "" . Sometimes it's best to let the passage of time elapse before you give your honest opinion on a movie Eight years after its release now seems like a long enough time to see if it's as good as it was made outThere's no doubt PL is a strangely beautiful and haunting film . There is a major problem and that is that it never really escapes from the feel that it's two separate stories connected in a rather tenuous way . Ofelia lives in Franco's falangist , fascist Spain of 1944 and is made to live with her stepfather , the brutal sadistic Captain Vidal who holds the surrounding area in an iron fist . Ofelia , a child about to enter adolescence soon stumbles upon a strange underground kingdom populated by faries and demons and soon finds this magical kingdom can be every bit as cruel and oppressive as the war ridden and chaotic world of 1944Time to be a little bit controversial and state despite the idiosyncratic visual magic that Del Toro brings to his films by the far the best aspect is the real life horrors inflicted upon the human population of a fascist country and the fantasy elements seem to be included as a sort of gimmick , almost as if Del Toro thought a period drama would have no market outside of Spain . Every time the action cut to the underground fantasy a voice inside my head - no doubt the director - kept saying "" Please give me an Oscar for costume design , make up and visual effects por favor "" . When you've got an evil piece of work like Captain Vidal murdering people who needs made up monsters ?If we're talking about Oscar nominations let's talk about Sergi Lopez as Vidal , or rather let's talk about one of the biggest Oscar snubs in history that's up there with Bruno Ganz in DER UNTERGANG . Seems if someone plays a murderous right winger this seems to alienate the award voters almost as if they're seen condoning mass murder . I'm of the view that a film is only as good as its villain and they don't much better than Vidal , a man who is more than happy to return to the family table after executing a couple of suspected rebels as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened . This reflects the Latin attitude of fascism . South American countries were notorious for this in the 1970s and 80s but even as recently as the 1970s Spain had a rather poor human rights record under Franco . Indeed I once worked with a Spanish waitress called Maria who told me her grandparents were murdered by Franco's regime . I never found out if it was because they were leftists or because they were descended from people who killed Jesus but it was a very poignant reminder that fascism in Europe didn't end with the defeats of Germany and Italy in 1945As it stands PAN'S LABYRINTH is a strange but captivating movie . It's not quite a fairy tale and it's not quite a historical drama . It's contains wonderful performances and yet it's probably not the masterwork some people claim it to be . It never manages to overcome the inherent problem of being two stories trying and failing to gel together which means it's a good film but not a brilliant one"
snsh,"May 12, 2007",1/10,"I found the film incredibly boring and could't wait for it to ""get to the point."" The editing is not modern and tight, and has the speed of a 1980's film.The special effects are on par with a star trek episode. There isn't much CGI to speak of aside from a couple fairies and a frog. The main Pan character wears a Halloween costume.But most frustrating about the movie is the characters. The writing makes everything so painfully obvious; ""oh look, the bad guy sets a trap, and the good guys fall for it!"" And they all seem so self-absorbed, mostly because they have nothing that smart to say.I don't understand how anyone could find the film enjoyable."
and-46245,"Jun 1, 2022",10/10,"Guillermo Del Toro has a wonderful imagination and helps make some of the most inventive, interesting and touching movies.So right off the bat I'm kissing his feet over this, but honestly, this movie is fantastic. It might be a fantasy movie? It might not be. That's what's so interesting, the ambiguity. Does this girl imagine all these things to help her deal with her situation and the war or are they actually happening?You'll find yourself questioning it, both ways. Regardless of what you personally think is true, it's a good war-time drama about family and resistance set in fascist Spain.VFX mix with practical effects in the best of ways, just like with other Del Toro movies. Monsters and beasts are wondrous yet creepy. The world of magic is both fantastic and frightening."
jmerlino,"Dec 29, 2023",9/10,"The thread of magical realities that can often be found in Spanish literature is on full display here. Other reviewers have wondered if Ofelia's world is real or not. The answer is, it doesn't matter. You're not going to get a neat answer to that, and it's a good thing.Historically, fauns and fairies are nature spirits and so it is here. The world outside of Vidal's mill is teeming with magical creatures, and also republican soldiers. The point here is that the woods - nature - are out of Vidal's control.The power Vidal wields is brutal and absolute, but only within the confines of the mill. The forest will take everything from him. His son, his stepdaughter, his command, and ultimately, his life.Ultimate, the message of the film is that nature is magical, and authoritarianism ultimately cannot stand against it."
ChristianUnchained,"Apr 23, 2013",9/10,"Unique, very well crafted adult fairy tale. The fantasy component, while not getting much screen time, is effective at conveying an interesting twist in the genre. It's an incredible fusion, and features some awesome character designs. Performances across the board are effective and at times powerful. The original score is also moving, fitting the action perfectly.Granted, Pan's Labyrinth is fairly bizarre but is more than approachable. It is a spellbinding tale of love, sacrifice, and courage that is incredibly memorable. If only we got a further glimpse deeper into the mind of Del Toro, this movie would be perfect. If you are looking for something unique and a little different, look no further than this classic."
tankace,"Nov 2, 2016",10/10,"Now to be perfectly honest with you ,dear reader, I am a HUGE fan of del Toro films, with the Hellboy movies been among my favorites superhero and fantasy movies and Pacific Rim the best flick about giant robots since Iron Giant, so yes I genuinely believe he is a great director, writer and producer. And as far as I see it his best work as yet this one Pan's Labyrinth one of the most beautiful, atmospheric and captivating film I have ever seen in my life.The story takes place in Spain after the Civil War of 1936 to 1939 and follows the young bookish girl Ofelia ,who goes with her pregnant mother to a military camp under to control of her step-father, the general and commander of that place and one of the most cruel, arrogant and sadistic villain in movie history, who could give Ramsay Bolton a run for his money. During her stay at each opportunity she has, escapes in to a fantasy world that is just around her corner and confronts creatures that are both amazing to look at and totally terrifying. The movie also gives time to the rebel group that is hunted down by the Franco forces and their tries to survive and beat back the fascist in the camp.The contrast between the fantasy world that we among side Ofelia explore and the real one is close to perfect for we see both similarities and differences. To elaborate on that this contrast makes it impossible to see these two worlds separated for when you look closely you find out that in their structures and designs have some parallels that are too go to spoil you have to see them yourself.Another great thing about the flick is that the story feels like a fairy tail, but isn't like those we all know like Snow White and the seven dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty , the Little Mermaid and so on. For del Toro turn the model of the classic fairy tails complete on its head and gives you a story which feels both realistic in plot, out of this world when it comes to the fantasy elements, which looks as they were the child for a beautiful dream with a horrifying nightmare and you want to look over and stare at it at the same time.As for the acting, is perfect with Ivana Baquero that plays Ofelia been so good that for a while I forgot that she was acting, Doug Jones as the titled Pan as is usual for him been in to the character( literally) and the rest of the cast having their time to shine.For anyone who likes creature feature, fantasy, the fairy tails with a twist or in general good movies is a must watch, like now. And to close with a warning, it is not a film for children, not at all ,it is for a more mature audience ,so if you want to watch it with your kid, young nephew or niece ,do it as your own digression."
chrispi-2,"Dec 20, 2006",6/10,"I for one didn't think it was that great. I was expecting fantasy, not people killing each other.If you think you are going to see a dark faerie tale, you're not. You're going to see a person's face get beat to a pulp in graphic detail, a severe wound sewing operation in graphic detail, bullet shots to the face in graphic detail - and a lot of people getting shot at point blank range. Of course, all this violence is proported to have some sort of meaning, as in, ""see how cruel people are too each other"". But to me, the movie came across as, ""see how much we think you want to watch people being cruel too each other and then we'll come up with a nice theme about how people are so cruel so that you can feel good about our movie's sadism."" Apart from that, I can't say that is was a bad movie, just not something that I care to see. Actually, I went in thinking this was the director of Y Tu Mama & Prisoner of A., but when I found out Guillermo is really the directory of Devil's Backbone and Hellboy, I went, oh yeah - THOSE movies that didn't do anything for me."
snowadian,"Mar 24, 2021",10/10,One of my top 10 of all time. The creativity and screenplay are a masterclass in storytelling. Beautifully crafted movie that leaves a lasting impression.
Bernie4444,"Jan 11, 2024",10/10,"Director Guillermo del Toro outdid himself and created a film beyond any previous presentation. Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the result of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.It is 1944 in Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi López.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, are the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze, or are they figments?You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog. See how the two world parallels in furniture. See out the two works hold similar tasks as both containing a key and a knife. Also, there are always more surprises waiting.The acting is superb especially Ofelia's death scene. Ivana Baquero Won, Imagen Award Best Actress, Premio ACE Best New Actress, Newcomer Award Female (Categoría Femenina), Turia Award New Best Actress, and Nominated, Young Artist Award Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Leading Young Actor or Actress.The Blu-ray version I watched had English subtitles as an option but I found them to be a tad inaccurate and wanting of some of the background conversations. However, the director's voice-over option helped point out the obvious that was not obvious until he pointed it out. As pointed out by the director, the violence was not for violence's sake in the story and they did not have cowboy type breakable props.This is one of the films that take good advantage of Blu-ray resolution and intensity."
emily-01028,"Feb 2, 2023",10/10,"One of the best fantasy films and arguably Del Toro's finest work. The viewer is immersed in a visual world inside the mind of a child trying to survive the violent realities in the world that is evolving around her. It is the perfect opening into a childs escape into the fantasy realm, which may be real or not, that is left up to the viewer to decide.Harrowingly violent in places and beautifully gentle in others, this is a journey full of unknown corners and tension as well as astounding creativity and visual delights.This almost stands as a two part story, one in the fantasy realm and one in the harrowing events of spain at war, both folding together with a little girl who finds herself existing between both."
ssjenkins,"Aug 18, 2022",10/10,"Hadn't watched this movie in about 15 years , and to be honest I'd forgotten just how good it was . I kept trying to find flaws in it , but couldn't . The story . The acting . The effects . All top notch . I'd love to give it a 9 , but couldn't . So a 10/10 it is ."
baekms,"Feb 4, 2018",10/10,"When I first saw this movie, I had this rare feeling like entering another world with my whole body and mind from beginning till the end. It was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, produced and distributed internationally by Esperanto Filmoj and Warner Bros.
The story takes place in Spain in the summer of 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. 
Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944s, during a time of Spanish civil war. A ruthless Captain has set up camp in a distant forest, and requests that his pregnant step-wife and her fantasy-obsessed daughter, Ofelia join him there.Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film The Devil's Backbone (2001) to which Pan's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's DVD commentary. 
The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English title refers specifically to the faun-like Greek deity Pan. 
The film won numerous international awards.
There are some visually brutal scenes in it, so attention. 
The acting is amazing, especially the young Ivana Baquero, playing Ofelia. 
The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just sucks all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. Pay attention to the great ""pale man"": a most terrifying creature in the movie.
To me it's a jewel in the movie world: a sad description of the Franco period, mixed with a great fantasy: cruel, sad but wonderful."
cyrese-65547,"Sep 28, 2021",10/10,"Wow. I'm not going to lie, it took me a long time to actually get to this movie. I knew almost nothing about it but the title so I went into this completely blind. This is a masterpiece. I didn't think you can combine a grounded war film with whimsical(yet darkly eerie) fantasy without the tones of the story clashing with each other but that madlad Guillermo del Toro did it. As ashamed as I am to admit this is my first time actually watching this movie, I am glad to say I got around to it and it was worth it big time. Do not stall like I did, watch this asap! I will certainly be revisiting Pan's Labyrinth."
Gabe37,"Jan 29, 2018",10/10,"This is the first time I write a review for a movie, and it happens to be for my favorite ever. I remember watching it back in 2007, and I was mesmerized by the cinematography, the performances, the direction and the music that makes you travel with your mind. But the most fascinating thing was the way the real world and the fantasy world are connected. Guillermo Del Toro proved to be a master at this. It's a war movie, a fantasy movie, a drama movie, a horror movie and it excels at all these parts.
As far as the performances are concerned, Ivana Baquero really delivers (despite her young age) and Sergi Lopez truly becomes one of the most convincing and hateful bad characters in the history of cinema. The rest of the supporting cast is remarkable too.No matter how great I think this movie is, I would not recommend it to everyone. I work in a DVD Club and I have noticed that not all people can appreciate it. It is certainly not because of the spanish language, but the fact that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a perfect representative of -what I call- thinking cinema. It is a movie that will make you think of it for days after you have watched it. It includes so many symbolisms and life lessons... But for those who like this kind of movies, I would say ""Watch it now!"".
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Del Toro because he gave us a movie to remember for years... A movie which combines the misery, the hope and the dreams that make us feel alive."
megumimjohnson,"Sep 9, 2020",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a moving film about grace in the midst of evil. It can be appreciated on at least two levels. A little girl and her mother move to the countryside of Spain to be with the mother's new husband in the final days of her pregnancy. The girl, Ophelia comes across a labyrinth in which she meets a faun. He gives her three tasks to complete by the full moon to prove she is the lost daughter of the King of the underworld. This movie shows her doing the tasks and dealing with the complications of the mother's pregnancy. It is an extremely moving story of a soul's journey to its father. As you watch the movie you can see that the cinematography, especially the lighting, corresponds with the meaning and outcome of the movie. Pan's Labyrinth is a movie with great spiritual insight on who we are and who our father is. Unquestionably one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I recommend this movie, as it gives a glimpse of the deeper meaning of the world."
jschuss,"Jan 27, 2007",1/10,"This movie is horrendous. Incredibly violent without even the coherence of Quentin Tarentino, I'm disgusted that I wasted money on it. The violence is graphic, gratuitous, and frequent. (The LA Times reviewer who claims that the violence gives us something to fear is completely off the mark. This isn't violence cleverly used to instill fear, it's just pushing buttons. Apparently Del Toro thinks that to create a real sense of fear you crush somebody's face with a beer bottle...a scene btw that is in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and fully rendered on camera...). To add insult to injury, the story is simplistic, unsophisticated, uninteresting, and ultimately boring. Sadly, if you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen all the images worth seeing. The rest of the imagery is brutal and unnecessary. It's gonna take a lot of scrubbing and a lot of soap to get this crap off my brain..."
s_a_n_d_w_i_c_h_e_s,"Aug 6, 2007",N/A,"I have seen all bad movies lately, even two yesterday and today and this was the third. Possibly it was the worst of the three of them. It's a weird film about a little kid who finds a secret world in Spain or Mexico and her mother's sick. Her father is a bad soldier who kills people in a war that is happening in the real world, although not in the secret world she finds.I thought it was rubbish. It made me uncomfortable, like peanut butter slapped on my head or eating too much spicy lamb. The so-called special effects were not-so-special and didn't look realistic. At times I even thought the film would overheat! LOL Or cause a combustion LOL"

I don't want to give away the story because it's good and original and I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but I will say that it is in Spanish and when I saw it there were English subtitles, in case anyone was wondering. Also, this film is good because it has not only lots of special effects and a fantasy feel, but because it shows the reality of what happened in Spain before...Very well combined...

claudio_carvalho,"May 25, 2007",10/10,"In 1944, in the post-Civil War in Spain, rebels still fight in the mountains against the fascist troops. The young and imaginative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her pregnant and sick mother Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil) to the country to meet and live with her stepfather, the sadistic and cruel Captain Vidal (Sergi López), in an old mill. During the night, Ofelia meets a fairy and together they go to a pit in the center of a maze where they meet a faun that tells that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. He also tells that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three gruesome, tough and dangerous assignments first. Meanwhile, she becomes friend of the servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), who is the sister of one of the rebels and actually is giving support to the group. In a dark, harsh and violent world, Ofelia lives her magical world trying to survive her tasks and sees her father and king again.""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is among the best movies I have ever seen, with a fantastic, but very sad, pessimist and violent story, supported by magnificent and powerful characters, wonderful art work, cinematography, soundtrack and make-up. The story takes place in a very difficult period of the Spanish history, the post-Civil War with the victory of Franco. Ofelia, an intelligent girl that loves fairy tales and misses her father, creates an imaginary world to survive to the difficulties of the real world, living the fantasy as escapism. It is interesting to see that even her fantasy is creepy and dark. Her mother Carmen, played by the stunning Ariadna Gil, is a very weak and submissive widow, without expressing her opinion, who probably has suffered many difficulties to raise her daughter without a husband in such difficult times. On the opposite side, the wonderful Maribel Verdú plays Mercedes, a woman full of power and idealism, capable to humiliate herself to achieve her objectives. The outstanding Sergi López (the unforgettable Harry) plays one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen, a cruel, arrogant and evil man that shows no respect for anybody. There is a violent scene that is a rip-off of ""Irréversible"", when Captain Vidal hits the hunter in his nose with a bottle. This masterpiece is certainly the best work of the director Guillermo del Toro, from the excellent ""El Espinazo del Diablo"". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Labirinto do Fauno"" (""The Labyrinth of the Faun"")Note: On 20 December 2014 I saw this movie again."
alemeix,"Oct 23, 2006",10/10,"I was waiting this movie for a few months, and finally last week I saw it and I must to tell that all waiting worth it. It's a wonderful ""fairy tale"", with great performances (specially from Ivana Baquero), the setting, visual FX and all you can see in the screen is just great. This is a very touching story, and shows us an alternative reality in a world being destroying by hate, and this other ""reality"" is perhaps what we're looking for, inside of us, to keep a little faith. I hope you can enjoy this film as much as I did, because so long ago I haven't so much inspiration from a movie as I did with this one, it touched the little girl inside me, and all I can do is to bless our amazing ability to dream."
meladorie_magpie,"Nov 27, 2006",10/10,"Film's like Pan's Labyrinth only come once in a decade! This film is absolutely wonderful. It is a fantasy/fairy tale drama set during the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War at the end of world war 2. The central character is a little girl played by the subtle Ivana Baquero, but it is not a kids film. It is very violent and is bereft of ANY compassion. What is gained from all the violence is a strong metaphorical answer towards the 'real world' and the 'fantasy world' which the lead character is slowly led into. The films central explorations are hope, redemption, sacrifice, faith, fate and what answers lie beyond life itself. Yet, it is not an escape into a fantasy world.The set designs and costumes are outstanding. Doug Jones does a brilliant job of bringing Fauno and Pale Man to life. But the real star is Guillermo del Toro. With his great vision and excellent story telling, he brings the entire film to life. He knows exactly what fans want and works brilliant towards genre.This is a flawless film.""It is not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing. I've got to the point where it IS the Citizen Kane of fantasy movies. As soon as ANYONE says BUT, I don't want to hear it. It's like looking at the Mona Lisa and saying ""yeah, it's alright, gotta bit of a wonky smile"" NO... NO... NO!! It is a masterpiece"" - To that I agree and so should everyone else who watches this film.I can not praise this film enough. It is almost impossible to explain the experience. You have to see it for yourself. Especially with poor fantasy/fairy tale films that we've received this year and last year (Chronicles of Narnia), this should bring back hope towards cinema in everyone.If there is only 1 film you watch this year, watch Pan's Labyrinth."
bopdog,"Nov 25, 2006",10/10,"I believed them on 'Front Row', on BBC Radio 4, when they said this was a tremendous 'fairy tale' for adults. They also said it was NOT in any way, shape, or form for children. They were right. It does, indeed, hearken back to the original Brothers Grimm, and the older form of fairy tale, which was violent and very intense. Contrast this with the dumbed-down nursery tales pumped out by virtually everybody else, especially Disney.Disney fairy tale stuff is fine for 3 to 8 year-olds. And they do some great movies for adults, too. But Disney's over-sanitized cutsie-a-thons even troubled me as a child. My dad gave me the book 'Pinochio', published ca. 1900, when I was 10. It was a long, brutal, and scary story, very exciting and satisfying. Nothing like the treacle the Disney movie dished up to us. This is not to beat up Disney--- they do fine work, for what it is: morally ambiguous, maudlin, saccharine tales suitable for the uncritical. But do, do, DO understand that this movie is as far from anything Disney has ever even contemplated as possible. This is not for kids. It is for you. It is deep, serious, and as thrilling and exciting as any war movie, murder mystery, or family drama you'll ever see.I was intrigued throughout, and uplifted and gratified by the end. Clearly, this spectacular beauty is a masterpiece! I gave it a well deserved 10 out of 10."
angelocrus,"Apr 24, 2009",6/10,"Surely this isn't a kid movie.I expected nothing from it so I wasn't disappointed or something, this is one of the movie I haven't heard about until I saw it on the list.I watched the movie, it somehow bored me, kinda.I skipped some bit parts, those predictable or unnecessary parts... although there were only a few scenes.The special effects weren't that much fantastic, some scenes could've been done better.Too violent, but it was cool actually.6."
Supermegaton,"Apr 21, 2008",N/A,"This is no doubt the worst movie by Del Toro so far, no matter what other people have said. The plot is simply ridiculously unbelievable, especially if you know a thing or two about recent Spanish history and are not caught in ideological mousetraps. The plot is similar to Del Toro's ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (2001), but unfortunately it is much weaker. In fact, the viewer will not understand the plot at all unless he or she is mired in a certain ideology which Del Toro apparently shares with his leading actors. The absurdities and historical inaccuracies (especially those concerning Captain Vidal) are too gross and too abundant to list here, and the result is one of the most biased movies I have ever seen."
thaPredator,"Jan 22, 2007",10/10,"I am not going to write a lengthy review. Needless to say I agree with 90% of the positive reviews I have read on this site. This is a fantastic film, a pure vision of del Toro's passion for the story. Del Toro again makes a film intended solely for us, the viewers, to enjoy and admire. If more directors shared this same philosophy, there would not be nearly as many cookie cutter and plain awful movies churned out for the Hollywood bean counters year after year.I mainly am writing this review in response to the negative reviews on this site I purposely read. I found that in all the negative reviews, there was one common factor, all the people who hated the movie were people who had no idea what they were going to see. it's time to educate everyone:1. This movie is not a kids movie. Do not bring them. Leave them home with a babysitter.2. This movie is not all a fairy tale. It is set in fascist Spain after the Spanish Civil War, not completely in a magical world of make believe.3. This movie is violent. If you are offended by blood and realistic, non cartoony violence, stay home with the kids and babysitter.4. Don't go see this movie just because you are trying to keep up with the Joneses. Watch the full trailer, visit the website, read this review and others. EDUCATE yourself before blindly going into this or any other movie then leaving upset because it was not what you thought it was.The bottom line is, this is a beautiful film that you must see if you enjoy seeing directors put all their passion into a film. If you are tired of typical, tired, paint by numbers Hollywood films(I'm looking at you Shymalan, Soderbergh) then run out and see this movie!"
LemonyShepard,"Feb 4, 2007",10/10,"Yes, this movie is a fairy tale. Yes, it deals with fairies, fauns, and ogres, with magic spell books and princesses. No, this movie is not at all for children nor those who dislike major violence.Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944s, during a time of Spanish civil war. A ruthless Captain (Sergi López), has set up camp in a distant forest, and requests that his pregnant step-wife (Ariadna Gil) and her fantasy-obsessed daughter, Ofelia (brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero) join him there. As she tries to adjust to the country life smack dab in the middle of the battlefield, Ofelia runs into a magical fairy who leads her to a mystical labyrinth, where she meets a mysterious and suspicious faun, Pan (wonderfully played by Doug Jones), who tells her that she is the long-lost princess of an underground kingdom, and that she must complete three dangerous tasks to return to her throne.While the movie closely follows Ofelia's tasks, spoken to her by a magic book from Pan, it is mostly about the war, double agents (Maribel Verdú and Álex Angulo), and the Captain's near-obsession with his expected son. The battles are extremely brutal (starting early with a couple of rabbit hunters) and made me queazy a couple of times. So brutal are these deaths, in fact, that you'll be relieved to see a simple shot to the head or back.The acting is top-notch, and young Ivana Baquero has a huge and brilliant future ahead of her (picture Dakota Fanning, only a better actress and less annoying). The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just sucks all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. The ""pale man"" (also played by Doug Jones), is by far the most terrifying creature in the movie, most-likely to give even the most mature and grown-up adults shivers.Yes, this movie does have sub-titles (it's in Spanish), but it's hardly noticeable at first, so much so that you forget about them by the tragic end of the movie.This movie is frightening and sad to the extreme, but it also gives you a sense of hope that magic does, in fact, exist. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and truly the fairy tale of the decade!"
Bob Pr.,"Feb 6, 2007",10/10,"The fairy tale aspects of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" resemble somewhat Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" in that there is a fantasy world one steps into and out of from a ""real"" world. But the film of ""...the Wardrobe's"" book was not the work of CS Lewis but of a translator (into film).IMO ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has FAR more power and I suspect much of that comes because it is the director's (del Toro) fairy tale and his conception and realization was always in the grammar and syntax of film. Probably, for that reason, it is an EXTREMELY powerful, unforgettable presentation.Some will despise it while many others will value it, often for similar reasons: there is not a single message or a single point of view. The film can be viewed from almost equally valid contrasting positions -- one, that the fairy tale aspects are a young girl's fantasy life boat she creates to escape a harsh, uncomfortable world. The other is that her fantasy world DOES have a reality and life of its own.There is ample evidence distributed throughout for both points of view.HELPFUL HISTORICAL POINTS: The time is 1944, shortly after the end (1939) of the last Spanish Civil War which was won by the fascist dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco, head of the Spanish army in Spanish Morocco. His fight and rise to power was supported by many factions: the Catholic church, many wealthy Spaniards, and other factions. Franco's bloc was opposed by the existing government (a republic) and a coalition of other factions with opposing agendas (such as decreasing the strong influences of the Catholic Church and the wealthy upper class, etc.).Several autocratic regimes gave Franco support: Hitler and Mussolini sent tanks, dive bombers, and troops, flouting League of Nations efforts to keep others from intervening. Spain became Hitler's laboratory for his later Wermacht tactics. Socialists, communists, and anti-fascists in many countries provided volunteer soldiers to help the republic; the Abraham Lincoln brigade was composed of Americans who volunteered to fight fascism.Franco's forces made deliberate efforts to crush equally all opposition and non-supporters by brutality, coercion, atrocities. The actions in this film deal with residual rebel forces unwilling to concede defeat.I have no idea how representative Capitan Vidal's actions and attitudes would be for Spain in 1944, five years after the Civil war's end but they are symbolic of the approach used by Franco forces during the war (and possibly also by many of those who opposed him, maybe in retaliation? or maybe not?).The photography, music, visualizations, directing, casting and acting are superb. It's said at Cannes the film received a 22 minute ovation; IMO every second was deserved.There are some scenes of graphic torture that I could not bear to see and had to position my hands in front of my eyes so I could still read the subtitles while blocking the rest of the screen.THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN. It is both a history lesson and a fairy tale for adults.The preteen girl in the part of Ofelia is outstanding and carries a film that needs no carrying. The other main characters were also excellent -- Capitan Vidal, Carmen (his new wife), Mercedes (house manager & rebel), the doctor, and the Faun/Pale Man.IF you can appreciate ambiguity in the dividing line between fantasy and reality -- and competing interpretations, IF you can tolerate holding up your hands to block acts of cruelty from your eyes, SEE IT -- it's destined to be an iconic classic.BUT IF that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, save your time and money, see something else -- and don't diss this for being something it isn't.FWIW/FYI: at this time, with 19,000+ votes, over 85% rated ""PL"" as a 10, 9, or 8; fewer than 5% rated it 5 or lower."
jluis1984,"Oct 23, 2006",10/10,"It seems as if it was just yesterday when a young Mexican director named Guillermo Del Toro sold his house in order to get enough money to complete his first feature length movie, ""Cronos"". Now, more than 10 years later, Guillermo Del Toro finally has created what many (himself included) call ""his masterpiece"", and to the surprise of many, they are not wrong. ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro's 6th movie, is truly a wonderful film deeply rooted in the director's favorite genres: horror and fantasy. A modern fairytale, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a remarkable achievement that probably, is just the beginning of a new stage in this courageous and imaginative director.Set in Spain in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who travels with her mother (Ariadna Gil) to a rural area to meet her mother's new husband, the Captain Vidal (Sergi López). But Ofelia is not very happy with her mother's decision, as the Captain is a very strict and evil man who serves Franco's fascist regime and enjoys to hunt the remaining rebel forces. In the middle of this post-war nightmare, Ofelia finds an ancient labyrinth that is the path to a magical world of faeries and monsters.In ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro once again dives into the fantastic genres he loves so much, this time exploring the nature of fairy tales, taking them back to its original roots, when fantasy tales were grim, dark and violent. The contrast between the post-war scenery and the fantastic world Ofelia is about to enter is just the first display of the duality motif, constantly present through the film. However, this is more complex than a mere ""good versus evil"" tale, it's about Ofelia's quest for her place in a world filled with the chaos and confusion of war. Deconstructing the hero's journey, Del Toro takes Ofelia through the classic outline of the three tasks she must complete to be able to enter the fantasy realm, with the Faun (Doug Jones) acting as judge and guide.Visually, Del Toro's film is captivating and filled with a dark beauty that is both frightening and attractive. While the fantastic world Ofelia enters is considerably different than her reality, it's by no means less haunting, as it's also a violent world with scary monsters that may reflect the harsh reality of the post-war Spain. With many themes borrowed from Spain's folklore, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is very fresh and Del Toro's direction shows a maturity not seen before. One can only wonder what's next for the Mexican director as this film is easily his best film to date.The cast is simply excellent, starting with the young Ivana Baquero, who delivers a believable performance as Ofelia, carrying the film with power and making a very likable main character. However, the best performance comes from Sergi López, as the ruthless Captain Vidal. At first sight it may look as another typical villain, but López adds a lot of soul to a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional caricature in less talented hands. Maribel Verdú is also quite effective as Mercedes, a young woman who works as a servant and becomes Ofelia's only friend. She shows a lot of emotions in a character specially complex due to her role in the story. Doug Jones plays Pan, the Faun, delivering a very expressive performance under the heavy make-up he had to wear, making an interesting character even more mysterious than he already is. Finally, Álex Angulo and Ariadna Gil complete the cast with effective performances, although I found Gil a bit annoying. Angulo was simply excellent in a subtle low-key role.""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a movie that easily could had been a predictable fantasy tale like the rest, but Del Toro constructs a movie that, while clearly follows and respects the fairytale pattern, it's never boring or tiresome, and in fact it keeps increasing its haunting beauty to the unforgettable last frame. Some have criticized the apparently biased way Del Toro presents the Spanish Civil War, but personally, I think that he makes sure to show that, no matter what side you are, in war the ones that lose the most are the children. While the movie is of course very violent, I think the ""R"" rating is really unnecessary, as in the end, real fairy tales used to be that way too.In the end, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a very moving film, moving back and forth between the horror and fantasy realms with ease creating a dark world that may just be a reflection of our own violent reality. Beautifully haunting, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a movie that can't be missed. 10/10. A Masterpiece."
gaeanprayer,"Sep 10, 2007",10/10,"Pan's Labrynth deserves a spot as one of the greatest movies of all time, in and outside of its genre.Many hearing of the movie's plot, its involvement with mythical creatures and a magical world through a child's eyes, might confuse this for a family fairy tale; I think, at times, I might have preferred that.In actuality, Pan's Labrynth borders on horror. Ivana Baquero plays a young girl named Ophelia who struggles through a life rapidly spiraling out of control, one she as a child cannot influence. A sickly mother, a brutal step-father, and amidst a war in literally her own backyard, one can't help but sympathize with Ophelia's desire to escape. She finds just that opportunity within an entity, the Faun, straight out of the fairytale books she carries about with her. The Faun himself seems frightening, almost demonic, with a snake-like tongue that leaves you unsure of whether his requests of the girl are truly in her best interest.Ophelia, desperate to escape into a world so like the fairy tales she's read, sets off through dangerous territories as the Faun's request. Yet, as dangerous as her quests are, her return home becomes a gradual descent into the brutal darkness of her own human people, leaving one to question just who is the real monster in the movie.In the end, it all seems very bitter; it starts to seem that no one really cared about Ophelia to begin with. I found myself so wrapped into the movie that I felt my own heart-breaking despair. I kept hoping it would suddenly get better, that someone would rescue Ophelia and protect her from the darkness encroaching from every corner.It's hard to say whether Pan's Labrynth truly had a happy ending. Losing the people who meant most to her, one was left behind, one last person who cared, and it seems no one in this story leaves without their wounds. The entire movie, from beginning to end, tugs at the darkest despair and deepest sadness you could only hope to avoid, with every happy moment tinged with poignancy.I think, all in all, this is a very adult movie that a family can enjoy with some serious parental guidance; the horrors within are as fascinating as the wonders to come. The top-notch acting will draw you in and hold you despite any language barrier (cleverly overcome with subtitles) and when it's finally over, it's hard not to feel the shame, anger, and triumph, as if the trials were yours alone."
raul-petrut,"Oct 9, 2007",6/10,"I am wondering for who is this movie. Kids should not watch this movie because of it's brutal, explicit scenes!!! Adults... they can, but the attention to detail and those beautiful landscapes contrasts with some shocking scenes and in the end the overall impression I cannot say that is not one of an enjoyable movie. And one more thing, there is no beneficent entity that will ask you to sign or give your or others blood for a ""higher purpose""(Eg. give some blood for the Deadly nightshade-Atropa belladonna-root) so... this is a mixed story with, I would say, many demonic creatures. As someone before me commented this is a beautiful but dark masterpiece."
teh_mode,"Nov 25, 2006",9/10,"All your emotions will be thoroughly tested in Guillermo Del Toro's grim fairy tale. A masterful fable that alternates between uber-gritty realism and dark, twisted fantasy with such a sublime slickness, it is near startling. A young woman by the name of Ofelia has just moved to rural Spain, with her sick, pregnant mother where her new husband, the slimy fascist Captain Vidal is currently holding his troops. Constantly under fire from partisan soldiers in the wooden hills, Vidal must attend to his wife whilst fighting for Franco's regime. Ofelia, meanwhile, is caught in a struggle to escape the grim realities of war-torn Spain. She is in love with stories, notably her fairy tales. One night, she is visited by a fairy, which brings her to the ""labyrinth"". A secret maze, run by a tall, tree-like faun. He calls her ""your highness"" and a princess, and gives her tasks to complete for him, each one adding a new page to her empty fairytale book.Whilst from a distance Pan's Labyrinth may seem like a children's grim fairytale, it is anything but for children. The majority of the movie is far more concerned with Captain Vidal and his horrendous callousness to both his wife, his people and to the Spanish resistance. In a film that features a skinless monster with eyes in his hands, slowly creeping towards Ofelia as she avoids becoming the rancidly gravel-voiced demon's next dinner meal, Vidal is by far the most putrid thing on screen. A man who fears dreamers and thinkers, one of who just happens to be the innocent Ofelia. Her mother doesn't understand, nor does the Captain. It seems the only people she can turn to are the shrewd resistance-sympathising maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of Y Tu Mama Tambien fame) and the faun himself.Do not be fooled. This is a movie about children, but not for children. There are at least two torture sequences, which despite being purely simplistic are every bit as masochistic as Saw or Casino Royale. The themes dealt with in Pan's Labyrinth are simple, yet adult ones, managing to mesh the contrast between fantasy and reality to startling effect. Every bit as wonderful and awe-inspiring as it is grim and melancholic  you will be hard-pressed to find a better film this year."
len-21,"Jun 17, 2007",6/10,"I simply can't see what all the fuss is about regarding this movie. There have been hundreds of more violent movies. There have been dozens of more magical movies. There have been tens of better war movies.What's more, there was very little, if any, character development. We were sympathetic to the child, but pretty much couldn't care less about any of the other participants. All of them were disposable.I don't like subtitles, but I can live with them and decided not to penalize the movie for them. But, given the choice, it's a no-brainer.The biggest problem with the movie is simple. It's the ketchup and ice cream analogy. Both are good, but they suck together. Here is a war movie with a child who lives in a fantasy world - presumably in order to escape her terrible surroundings. The fantasy was fairly interesting. The war was fairly interesting. Putting both together in the same movie is ketchup and ice cream. It is irrelevant to me that the reason the fantasy even exists is because of the war. The fact is, they don't mesh well in a movie. But, I will admit, that's just my opinion. Someone else may find the exist together just fine.Len"
Barky44,"Jan 28, 2007",8/10,"It's been over 24 hours since I saw Pan's Labyrinth at the local Googleplex. I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. I'm giving it a good grade (8 out of 10) because it is wonderfully shot, and has great art direction, cinematography, and set design. It's also very well acted and directed, and it's not pretentious or overbearing or simplistic or goofy.I guess it just didn't connect with me, like it's apparently connected with thousands and thousands of true fans. I'll try to describe the reasons why in a couple of paragraphs, but I doubt they'll be able to capture my antipathy properly.First, this isn't really an ""adult fantasy film"" as some have ascribed. It really is about kids, namely a girl who's stuck in a horrible position (forced to live with the cruel captain who married her mother). The film shows how kids in terrible situations can often mentally retreat into various fantasies, in this case a realm of fauns and fairies. So why did they give it an ""R"" rating and market it to adults? They should have cut down the violence a bit (it's not gratuitous, the extra notch of ""R"" rated violence doesn't markedly propel the plot) and gone for a PG-13 rating. This way, it would have been actually directed at kids (albeit older ones).As a reference point, consider what Stephen Spielberg did with his classic ""Empire of the Sun."" That, too, is a story about a kid caught in terrible circumstances (namely imprisonment in Japanese-held China during WWII). That was a PG-13 film, and shot through the eyes of the child, instead of through the eyes of the adults around the child. Something about ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't ring true because of this. We're seeing a young girl's fantasies, but we are constantly torn back to an adult viewpoint. As a result, we never see this young girl grow and understand (and the evolution of a character is a prime force in cinema). If the director had kept us looking through her eyes, our sympathy for the character would be larger.I think that last paragraph was quite convoluted, so I'll try to re-phrase the main problem of this film. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" does not maintain the cohesive point of view throughout the film. Is this film about a bad world shown through the eyes of a child, or is it a film about the fantasies of a child shown through the lens of the real world? It's this lack of viewpoint cohesion that leaves me cold.8 out of 10."
jpschapira,"Jun 14, 2007",8/10,"Guillermo Del Toro is Mexican. I clarify this because I know it, and I assured the fact to a friend who watched ""El laberinto del fauno"" with me; but when the movie began with a Spanish accent, I doubted. And it's because Del Toro is obsessed with the Spanish Civil War, and we the adventures of little children in the midst of this important historical event (watch ""El espinazo del Diablo""); but all of this comes from his obsession with fairy tales, those that are only for children.But look at what he does: he invents the most infantile story of all, in a film that's everything except infantile. This is a double-edged sword; in fact, Del Toro is a double-edged sword himself. His obsessions come from when he was little, when he imagined creatures and monsters as part of his daily reality. He also has a photographic memory; these are all things that can as positive as they can be negative, and it is evidenced in his way of making cinema.The man knows a lot about cinema: he has experimented with cameras since his teenage years; he studied make-upThis plays against him too, mostly in ""El laberinto del fauno"", which is one of the most technically perfect movies I've seen in my whole life. The impressive sound edition becomes present from the first minute; the images are exaggeratedly beautiful; the music is perfect, but only because it is directly connected to the plot.All the particularities that can be found in this film's characters come straight from Del Toro; who wrote the screenplay of his fable himself. It is an enchanting script that commences with the telling of a simple fairy tale, revealing a main fact of the story immediately. We should remember something so fundamental, but this immersing quality of the script makes us forget. And it's not a complex screenplay, because it has its predictable points; but as we get lost in a world where reality and fantasy become one, we stop caring.Reality can be so strong that sometimes we choose to escape. The images of this film are very strong, therefore the main character, Ivana, finds a magical world that keeps her constantly away from what's happening around her. And the point is not to ask ourselves if this 'magical world' is real, trying to analyze every moment to put them together and see if they fit. That's unimportant, because in this story there's nothing to resolveBut there's a lot to understand.And I think that to really understand ""El laberinto del fauno"", you hace to understand its director. Del Toro's ability to bring incredible creations (from the same 'faun' to a monster with eyes in its hands) to us reflects the power of his imagination; maybe his only neutral quality. I think I'll never completely understand Del Toro, but I assume that his imagination is what makes him attractive to the people who work with him; and consequently makes them follow him anywhere.In this aspect, ""El laberinto del fauno"" stands close to ""Letters From Iwo Jima""; because just like Clint Eastwood in that film, Del Toro is an example of how crucial and predominant is the influence of the director in a cinematographic piece. ""El laberinto"" is excessively long, but nobody cared; the actors become insignificant, as if the characters had taken over them (and not the other way round as it should be)Everything seems to be part of a bigger unit: Guillermo Del Toro's vision."
jonny78,"Feb 16, 2024",6/10,"Ngl this movie wasn't super inventive. I was expecting something special but it's just some goofy ahh fantasy missions in the backdrop of grr franco bad grr republican good Spanish civil war portrayal. I'm not totally sure what the point of the film was, maybe it connects to some Spanish traditional story which is why everyone else found it so moving? To me, it just felt like a watered down version of tumbbad at times.The acting was good I guess, the characters did the best they could. The storyline is super super basic so i don't really know what everyone's on about giving 10/10 and 9/10 ratings.Good cinematography, passable costume design, moderate world building."
mentalcritic,"Aug 18, 2007",10/10,"It seems ironic that the films considered by many to be the best films of the previous year are both set in an episode of history long since past, but should never be forgotten. El Laberinto Del Fauno only misses out on being the best film of 2006 because Zwartboek took so awfully long to enter production, but its virtues exceed its faults by such a long way that it will always be a benchmark in storytelling. When I say it is based to a great degree on ancient fairy tales such as those written by the Grimm Brothers, it would be all too easy to mistake El Laberinto Del Fauno for being aimed at children. And that would be selling it oh so very short. Like all of the fairy tales that have been bastardised into something puerile by Disney, El Laberinto Del Fauno is a story that every adult should learn from. Children will be frightened and saddened by it, but intelligent or hyperlexic children (or both, such as I was), will get far more out of it than the G-rated tosh that they seem to expect intelligent children to enjoy nowadays.Set in a remote farm outpost in Spain during the Civil War, a forgotten episode in what is indisputably the darkest days of the twentieth century, El Laberinto Del Fauno concerns itself with one extremely dysfunctional family. The mother has just married a Captain of the Spanish army, an incredibly evil man who is without redeeming feature. It is amazing to see another film in the vein of RoboCop, Total Recall, or Zwartboek where the true villain of the piece is so unremittingly evil that one is unafraid to hate his guts for the film's duration. It makes the payoff at the end of the film that much more satisfying. The torments and injuries the Captain endures through the course of the film are gruesome enough, but we are allowed the luxury of believing he deserves every bit of it. As a nemesis for his stepdaughter, the Captain is one of the best-drawn middlemen of evil since Darth Vader. Yet, in spite of how he can gouge a man's eyes out without pausing for breath, he is by no means the most frightening thing in the film.El Laberinto Del Fauno, as you would expect with a film bearing such a title, is entirely in Spanish. This obviously necessitated the use of subtitles to translate the dialogue in countries where Spanish is not the primary language, but the nuances of the language would also make dubbing a crime. Even if you do not understand the phrases being spoken, their enunciations make the intent in every sentence plainly obvious. El Laberinto Del Fauno moves and plays like a silent film, where the combinations of body language and music allow the viewer to draw their own conclusion regarding the scene. One could even treat scenes like the Captain conducting his torture sessions as being a comedy if that is their inclination. Quite frankly, I feel it is a sick one, but that is the viewer's prerogative. To be quite frank, scenes in which participants torture one another have a much better aural quality to them when the dialogue is in Spanish. As a result, El Laberinto Del Fauno is the only film I have seen to date, other than Paul Verhoeven's Dutch-language efforts, that I feel uncomfortable watching at times.Special mention must go to the special effects team who, for one reason or another, chose to make the film using practical effects for what amounts to a majority of the screen time. CGI seems to have been limited to such tasks as painting out an actor's real legs or other such fine details that could not otherwise have been accomplished. The faun is such a marvel of practical costume design, puppetry, and digital erasure that one wonders if the whole team did not suddenly become possessed by the ghost of Jim Henson. However, unlike Ludo, Kermit, or Animal, the production team in this case has mastered the one emotion that Henson was never able to invoke in an adult audience: fear. Yes, even this grown man who continues to stand in horror as the realisation dawns that we have not learned a thing from the time this film is set in feels a shudder of genuine fear when the faun appears to lose his patience with Ofelia. Perhaps it has something to do with the complexity of the character.If you have not already seen the film, I advise skipping this paragraph, but it is necessary to discuss the final moments in order to illustrate a point. I must also praise the writers for the maturity and power of their story. The ambiguous nature of how the ending is phrased can lead the viewer to entirely different conclusions. If they choose, they can believe the princess was rewarded for her willingness to shed her own blood in place of her half-brother's. Conversely, they may also choose to believe the reward was little more than a dying hope on the behalf of yet another victim of a senseless war. Either way, praise is due to writer/director Guillermo del Toro for refusing to take the easy way out and simply throw a clearly happy ending into the audience's lap in order to appease them. This is a bold move that Peter Jackson especially fumbled by failing to execute in a satisfactory fashion. And that is partly the point. In spite of not being based on one of the most celebrated novels in the English language, El Laberinto Del Fauno will be remembered long after The Lord Of The Rings In Name Only is forgotten.El Laberinto Del Fauno is a ten out of ten film that everyone, but especially those with an interest in storytelling, should see at least twice."
moonspinner55,"Jun 2, 2007",5/10,"In 1944 Spain, as the Spanish Resistance is losing to the Fascist army, a pre-teen bookworm named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother come to stay with the girl's new stepfather, an icy army captain. While stopping for a break on their initial journey, the youngster fits the missing piece of a statue into its proper place; this unleashes a magical winged creature who leads the girl to the pale faun, a gargoyle-like guru who helps Ofelia understand she possesses the spirit of the Princess Moanna and will live eternal...that is, until she completes three heady tasks before the next full moon! Spanish-language fantasy from writer-director Guillermo del Toro begins well, combining elements of Grimm and 'Alice in Wonderland' with the modern, grotesque look of a Björk music video; however, the elements of the story are hazy rather than coherent (if Ofelia hadn't put back the missing piece, would she still have Moanna's spirit?). Baquero is sublime as the child, but every segue from her to the evil captain halts the movie's momentum, and the incidentals (the captain's party, Ofelia ruining her new dress, the assistant sneaking medicine) aren't compelling. A film which bides its time between an incredible fantasy world and the harsh realities of the day is ultimately going to come up short (we can't wait for the preliminaries to be over with so that the real story can progress); despite a smoothly efficient direction and an able cast, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" simply feels too slight, too undemanding to garner status as a fantasy classic. ** from ****"
parkqing,"Feb 6, 2007",10/10,"It is this kind of movies that makes life really something. There are always some excitements and joys awaiting us.I watched this movie last night, and I can't help to share my enjoyment with others. Life is complicated and mysterious. While most of us lead a desperate mundane life, it is still so.Like Whistler is reputedly the first painter to touch the nocturnal scenery, Del Toro explores the heart of the dark.Truman Capote's novels are classified into two categories: day settings and nocturnal settings.In the latter, it is the world of mysteries, it is the world of human hearts. and in this movie Del Toro entwines the two into a piece. hail to genius!"
mikethebutcher,"Nov 28, 2006",10/10,"This film is outstanding. I went to see it last night after hearing a few very positive reviews and I was not disappointed. I am not a film buff and am not familiar with Guillermo del Toro's non-Hollywood films so didn't really know what to expect, but the director's imagination impressed me greatly.This is both one of the most beautiful and the most gruesome/chilling films I have ever seen. The contrast between this, and between Franco's Spain and the Labyrinth are breathtaking. Franco's Spain in itself is a great backdrop to the film as it doesn't tend to get much exposure to non-Spanish audiences. The labyrinth is a superb piece of fantasy, with amazingly creepy characters like the Faun and the creature with no eyes.The characters are all well-developed and excellent. The acting is also perfect, as is the music. I was deeply moved by this film and would recommend it to anyone, except children who will have nightmares for years. Do not be put off by the subtitles, as they are barely noticeable. I find it hard to believe how anyone on IMDb could give this film a score below 7/8, it is fantastic."
WildWayz,"Nov 26, 2006",10/10,"My wife and I just got back from the showing at Hyde Park Picture House (Leeds) - first time i've been there and it was SO special. The cinema is one of those Ye Olde ones - single screen... tiny foyer with a small selection of food etc - beautiful decor and comfy seats - truly magical. We were sat up in the balcony and it was a fantastic experience.The movie has got to be one of the best films I have seen all year - such a breath of fresh air. The violence wasn't over the top and I am glad it was there as it showed cold brutality - along with the magical side too.The actors and actresses were all stars; delivering such powerful performances all round - you felt pity, resentment, hate and warmth. Completely different from almost all mainstream films.My wife was in tears at the end - because it was so wonderful, sad, tragic and powerful. It was SUCH a shame the cinema was pretty much empty and a majority of people will not be able to share if the beauty of this film.I so hope that America don't buy the rights to remake it in a few years time and have Steven Speilburg camp it up with silly little aliens. Leave it as is and it will one day be appreciated for what it was; a powerful, dark, beautiful fairy tale."
tokago,"Nov 27, 2006",10/10,"Up to this film, there was quite good enough evidence about the talent of Guillermo Del Toro as a director. I'm pretty sure that he will keep on providing good work. But however, after seeing this movie, there's one new thing else that i'm sure of... He will never be able to create such a beautiful movie again. This is surely a masterpiece; and this is his masterpiece that will ruin the rest of his life with a huge cast of shadow. Just like the Brazil did and actually -still doing- on Gilliam.El Laberinto del Fauno is a very brutal and violent fairy tale that is carefully and masterfully scripted and directed, both by Del Toro. It can easily be compared to last year's Chronicles of Narnia, but unlike Narnia, this movie is very clear and consistent on its subject material. While Narnia departs from its initial offer, moving towards an exaggerated symbolism, therefore towards a childish fairy tale since the symbolism was far out of range to be meaningful, El Laberinto Del Fauno never looses its ties with reality. What this movie offers is a very hard to find combination of reality and disillusion, an impossible to find mixture of violence/brutality and humanism, and a one in a million possibility of innocence and guiltiness together, all eating from same can. These kind of combinations or pairs can only exist in one place: in a singular brain. And just like that, the movie chooses a perfect atmosphere for delivering the story: Civil War. A civil war (in this movie: Spanish civil war in fact) is like a self-arguing brain. The harshness of reality and the dosage of brutality is horribly high, so that we can easily and -willingly cross over to disillusion with Ophelia. So; This Labyrinth, may be a very valuable opening to your-our forgotten childhood.This is a perfect movie, the perfect fiction movie (that i haven't seen for years) and obviously the best 2006 movie. Everyone should see this fairy tale, but not the children, because of the brutality fact. There will be sure enough time for it."
rglong-1,"Nov 2, 2006",10/10,"Excellent, successfully combining at least four different genres: coming of age, horror, fantasy, horrors of war docudrama, along with probably a few others.The fantasy images are spectacular and the human drama is intense. Unlike many movies that attempt to combine scattered fantasy elements into otherwise naturalistic environments, it never felt like I was being ripped away from the fantasy every time they focused on reality. What was going on in both worlds was compelling.Pan is portrayed very faithfully as a god of the earth and somewhat of a trickster. When I first saw the trailer and saw how demon-like they made Pan's appearance, I was concerned that the creators had Christianized the story and turned Pan into Satan. I was relieved to discover they stayed faithful to the Pan of Pagan mythology, so no Pagans watching it should fear defamation and no mythologists or historians should fear being totally annoyed.The horrors of war are brutally honest and graphic, which is exactly how war should be betrayed. So many movies romanticize it or make patriotic statements, when really war is an unspeakably terrible thing, especially when people have to live under a fascist regime, like the characters in this movie.Loved it, absolutely loved it. Would've given it an 11 if I could."
sweetemotion2,"Feb 2, 2007",10/10,"I didn't quite know what to expect with Pan's Labrynth. (Didn't even realize I was part of a test screening for it...) With that sad, this was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. The imagery and cgi are top-notch, and (dare I say) believable! Elements of fantasy blend well with the setting of the war-torn Spanish countryside, without pretentiousness and overbearing presentation.The violence was intense at moments, but it wasn't violence for the sake of violence. You won't see men falling to pieces on screen as with other war movies, but you will see commentary on human nature expressed through particularly intense moments.What perfected this movie for me was the character of Captain Vidal, and his contrast with the Faun and Mercedes. My hatred for this character kept me on the edge of my seat through most of the film.Do yourself a favor. Skip Stomp the Yard and The Hitcher. Pan's Labrynth is a film you will never forget."
PoloBurro,"Jun 18, 2007",N/A,"Obviously, all opinions on film are purely subjective, but I fail to see how this film lives up to its awesome reputation.Yes, it's nicely made, and Sergi Lopez is a fantastic super-villain, but there's little to amaze here.It's a film of two halves, fantasy and reality, and although there are some obvious parallels they fail to converge with any purpose.The fantasy sequences are Harry Potter meets Hellraiser. They look good but are not as visually stunning nor as strangely disturbing as you may have been led to believe. They owe more to standard fairy tales written by adults than they do the wild imaginings of children.Interestingly, the reality sections are the more like a child's view of the civil war in Spain, where the communists are lovable heroes and the fascists impossibly evil. Perhaps this is deliberate, but if so, I can't see the point.Del Toro's The Devil's Backbone is better in every respect, so I recommend you adjust your expectations to less than masterpiece before viewing."
dmturner,"Jan 13, 2007",6/10,"Because everyone else had waxed so euphoric over this film, I went with high expectations. However, though I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as extraordinary as I was led to expect. For one thing, the Faun is an awkward and crude creation, with a mad hint of Muppet about him; perhaps my vision has been spoiled by the proliferation of special effects in recent decades. For another, the movie was so dark and claustrophobic (both in the fantasy scenes and in the ""real-life"" scenes) that it was almost a caricature. The young lead actress was excellent, as were all the actors. However, the story line with its noble Nationalists, sadistic captain, innocent child, and bed-ridden mother-to-be struck me as hackneyed. Perhaps I am betraying my age, and all this seems new to everyone else who sees it.However, the acting is compelling and the savagery of the twisted Captain's acts (and the retribution exacted on him by the terrified, brave Mercedes) will stay with me for a long time."
thebrowncoats-1,"Feb 10, 2007",5/10,"I honestly do not understand why this film is receiving rave reviews everywhere. The story is simplistic. The only ambiguity is whether or not the girl is actually seeing fantastical creatures or is simply escaping the harsh realities of fascist Italy via her imagination. The acting is wooden; the characters, largely stereotypes. It is also a brutal film that is far too gory for children. So who is the intended audience? As for the special effects, they were imaginative but relatively infrequent. This was a movie that had lots of potential to which it simply did not live up. Apparently having subtitles and a different ""feel"" from the typical Hollywood film is enough to get rave reviews these days. Very disappointing."
theblacksuit3,"Dec 29, 2009",10/10,"I was excited to see this movie. I was expecting a high octane fantasy film with a lot of fairy-tale-ish stories, but it was a bit more focused on reality than the labyrinth. It was more centered on the war and it distracted from the Labyrinth's story. However I still loved it. The acting was amazing by the whole cast, and the make-up and effects were amazing. I loved the Pale Man the most. He was so freaky, That is the only horror character that I believe would scare me. However he could not best me in battle.The characters were great, but the story seemed bland. They jumped around too much for my taste. Overall, I do enjoy this movie, and it is worth the money to buy, because it is fun to watch multiple times, as long as it can hit home for you."
annoman,"Oct 22, 2006",10/10,"Bravo Guillermo! From the brilliantly perturbed visionary who shared his eerily morose tale of abhorrent warfare and infringed adolescent innocence in 'The Devil's Backbone,' comes the gorgeously sadistic fantasy, 'Pan's Labyrinth.' As quality fantasies seem to do, Del Toro's elegantly haunting 'Labyrinth' infiltrates the mind by way of its intrigue's fantastic visions; in this case, he does so with an alarming tale of Spanish tyranny, disquieting violence and superfluous gore. Not since the likes of Argento's 'Deep Red' and 'Suspiria' has carnage been so immeasurably beautiful. This poignant saga shadows the dreamy adventures of Ofelia, an imaginative young girl who creates the fanciful world of 'Pan's Labyrinth,' in which remarkable creatures of various sorts dwell. As the repressed nation of Spain witnesses its peak in post-war violence, Ofelia's adoptive father is given the responsibility of eradicating any rebellious alliances from the vicinity. While he and his wife struggle with the troublesome happenings outside their home, Ofelia escapes to her favorite place; one rich with wondrous landscapes and unknown fortune. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film of exceptionally rare caliber. Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity. Del Toro's 'Pan's' could very well be this year's 'Fellowship of the Ring,' snagging Oscar nods in the departments of makeup, costume design, set decoration, sound, editing, and art direction; heck, maybe it'll even win a few."

Lunar-Raven,"Sep 3, 2007",10/10,"Set in the 1944 fascist era of Spain, Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful but chaotic fairytale that teeters between nightmare, enchantment, and reality. While the story holds a some-what simple, straight forward plot, it is entwined with spectacular imagery, intelligent writing, and some of the most captivating moments that have ever hit the big screen. While this film by definition is considered a fantasy piece, it has a bit of something for everyone; making it an enjoyable film for all walks of life. Through-out this movie, Del Toro manages to weave a bit of history, politics, and fantasy, all together creating an original, unique, and compelling film.This film quickly begins as a unique story of a young girl named Ofelia unfolds. Ofelia, (played by Ivana Baquero), appears to be an average kid who loves to read and tell fairy tales. Her life drastically changes as she is sent along with her pregnant mother (played by Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather, Capitán Vidal. Capitán Vidal (played by Sergi López), is a ruthless and unforgiving captain of the Spanish army who wants his soon-to-be-born son to grow up with him; hoping that he can help carry out his name. Although Ofelia's ""real life"" situation turns sour as she must deal with her sick mother, as well as the violence that plagues the outdoors between the rebels and fascist troops -- all of these things quickly become less significant as she gets sucked into her own creative world; a world of mystery, enchanting fairies, faun's and giant frogs.Overall, I felt that this movie was extremely well done. From the amazing cast to the superb imagery, everything in this film was spot-on and created with a great deal of care. Although some of the previews may have been deceiving -- I will say that this movie is not a child's film. While there are some truly beautiful scenes that everyone could appreciate and love, there is also a great deal of realistic violence, death, corruption, and torture. In fact, over ¾'s of the movie is spent focusing on the ""real"" world within this base, which definitely isn't a pretty sight. I can however, say with certainty that Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliantly directed masterpiece, with some of the most visually jaw dropping scene's I've ever seen. This is easily the best fantasy film of 2006. If you like fantasy, I suggest you check this out; however, do be aware that there is quite a bit of violence in this film."
speeedo7,"Dec 4, 2006",10/10,"i was blown away.after tons and tons of ""american pies"", ""star wars""-like cg-overkilled soulless *products* - well politically correct polished consumer rubbish - finally a movie that moved me! for those out there - this is a real, bloody, very ""real fantasy"" that is meant to scare the hell out of you (like every other fairy tale, if you remember any).it has all the elements you can usually find at every Disney movie, fear of loss (parent, child... etc), deepest ""ur-ängste"", heroes, bad guys, good guys and a happy ending. not interrupted by lar-pur-lare cg - you can actually hardly notice any - which is good nowadays.and as for those who think no children should see this one - because it contains gore - think about snow white: for example, the hunter is sent out to kill a innocent girl (just because she is prettier) and bring back her heart...Disney that!"
adrian-stokes-1,"Dec 6, 2006",10/10,"This film will go down as being one of my all time favourites. Guillermo del Toro has done a fantastic job of bringing together war and the innocence of a young girls mind.There are very few movies where I can say that I think every actor (including the extras!) were brilliant but this is it. A shining star amongst them all must be Ivana Baquero. She takes on the hardest role of them all as she has to portray a young girl trying to cope with her own demons alongside trying to cope with living with a step father and in the middle of a battle field. Sergi López as the captain is another classic character, a lovable rogue you can respect as well as loathe.All in all this film has something for everybody. The subtitles (IMHO) don't take anything away from this film as the camera work appears to take into account the reader wont be able to keep up if its bouncing all over the place. 10/10 for me, cinematic brilliance!"
DR23,"Nov 25, 2006",10/10,"Not going to write much. Other than to comment on how much I enjoyed the exceptional imagining that created this movie. It is a rare movie that you leave the cinema and do not wish for any more detail or story. This was a complete movie and a complete story. The mixture of real life horror with the fantastical world was truly inspired. The effects were incredibly realistic and had me squirm as much as look on in awe. The acting and casting was perfect in every instance. Ivana Baquero was fantastic as the young girl who is caught so easily into a potentially dangerous and magical world, as the real world she is forced to be in is such a horrific war torn environment. Overall I recommend this to anyone who claims to love movies."
alan_wyper,"Dec 14, 2006",6/10,"I wish I could say I liked this film more than I did, since it certainly has some impressive aspects to it. Undeniably it is visually stunning, particularly the fantasy sequences, which feature some marvellously weird and imaginative fairy tale beasts. The acting is also excellent.Yet I just didn't feel the two story strands - the real world civil war drama and the fairy tale fantasy - gelled together in a meaningful way. I'm not sure if the fantasy aspect was supposed to be some kind of allegorical comment on fascism, but if it was it was too obscure for me to appreciate. Instead it just seemed to sit uneasily alongside the often brutal events unfolding in the real world sequences.Altogether it had the feeling of a film that thought itself more profound than it actually was. Although it carried me along well enough while I was watching it, after it finished the impression I was left with was of a mildly diverting, but ultimately inconsequential piece of film-making."
paulk-20,"Jun 1, 2007",1/10,"As I see movies made within the past 20 years climb the ranks of the IMDb top 250 with alarming speed, I wonder what on earth is happening. I see that this movie is at #41, higher than Chinatown, The Third Man, To Kill a Mockingbird, Alien, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Metropolis, and even The Wizard of Oz. Does Pan's Labyrinth deserve such high praise? Yes, it is steeped in intellectual metaphor and is crafted in such a Philip K. Dickian manner that the audience is left wondering what was real in the film. I applaud the filmmakers abilities in this manner, but regarding what they are willing to portray, they have the restraint of sociopaths. This movie contains some of the most wretched, horrific violence and psychologically uncomfortable character interactions I have ever seen in a film. Early in the movie, we watch as the cruel Captain Vidal crushes the face of an innocent young man while his helpless father watches. Vidal shoots the father moments later, after the man had to watch his son die in front of him.Art is no longer on the minds of movie makers, instead they revel in their abilities to accurately replicate grisly murders and terrible nightmares. Suggesting violence gives way to indulging in the talents of the make up artists and the FX men. Subtlety and metaphor are discarded so the audience is not simply a witness to gruesome murders, but is forced to be a part of them. The story, fascinating as its concept may be, is buried under layers of constant uncomfortableness. There is no relief for the audience. Thanks to the movie establishing the evil of Vidal early on, the audience squirms in dreaded anticipation for what his next cruel act will be, and who he will direct his wrath towards. The movie ultimately delivers, committing the cardinal sin that a movie can make: showing the graphic death of a child. Pay It Forward tried this bit of emotional manipulation, and lost any credibility it had as a story. The narrative was lost, the escapism destroyed. Once the innocent little girl died in Pan's Labyrinth, the audience remembers that they're watching a story and their emotions are being toyed with.I despise seeing such films because I ultimately feel anger not towards the characters in the films, but at the filmmakers themselves for presenting me with such atrocities. I know Pan's Labyrinth is based in folklore, but I don't believe for a second that this is any kind of fairy tale. When a parent reads a child Hansel and Gretel, the visuals are very cartoony and are relayed through the buffer of said parent. With this ""film,"" there is nothing but blood seeping from the mouth of an innocent little girl to tell the audience that the fairy tale is over. A fairy tale for adults? That's false advertising and I hope that all with weak stomachs are fairly warned."
cpppfeffer-1,"Dec 4, 2007",N/A,"I can;t believe this movie received that ratings it did. This movie has nothing to do with a fantasy story but all with a horrific and rather shallow story reminiscent of a horror movie. Besides the shock ""value"" there is absolutely no need to be that graphic in order to get the story across - in fact, less would have been a lot more! But maybe here lies the genius of the movie maker - to shock the dull and pampered audience out of their seats - minds - so that their attention is caught and they kind of feel alive.But in all this grossness - there could have been true art - but I am afraid - no. It is flat and at best the some of the acting deserves mentioning. In my book this movie is a flop!"
johnson_daren,"Dec 5, 2006",10/10,"Fiendishly dark, menacingly brutal, and wonderfully elaborate. This film never really lets you relax; instead it grips you firmly, yet unsettlingly, on the edge of your seat and compels you to watch. Through the eyes of war and the eyes of a child this masterpiece weaves its lingering spell of legend, creatures and magic. Superbly acted the story quickly draws you in; from the beautiful fantasy and richness of the underworld to the graphic nightmare and gritty reality of war, every frame is utterly captivating. A haunting soundtrack, which includes the eerie lullaby from Mercedes, complements the mood and atmosphere of the film wonderfully. A true work of genius and simply the best film I have seen all year."
Designfiend,"Nov 18, 2006",10/10,"If anyone approaches this movie expecting a Fantasy film, they will be disappointed. Much like anyone approaching ""The Devil's Backbone"" expecting a ghost story ""ala"" ""Sixth Sense"". Although the Fantasy is not as scarce as some may lead you to believe (the film contains over 300 beautiful cgi shots) the fantasy elements are not always overwhelming but present throughout- may be a book, a mandrake root (beauty) or a sentient insect, etc, the elements pepper the tale. Calling it a fantasy film in the time of Potter and ""Lord of The Rings"" is setting any audience member for a disappointment. To call it beautiful, cruel and poetic is to preface it, I think, more accurately. It moved me deeply."
CuriosityKilledShawn,"Nov 30, 2006",8/10,"Don't get muddled up. This is not a movie in which a cute American girl dances with she-man David Bowie and makes pals with huge cuddly toys. No, this is one of those eviler fairy tales with baby-eating monsters and bloody carnage. The kind of stuff that Hellboy director Guillermo Del Toro is best at.Ofelia and her mother move from the city to a large mansion in a rural area of 1944 Spain. Mother has remarried, since the death of her dad, to the cruel and wicked Captain Vidal. A man who only wants her for her womb and unborn child, with no interest in Ofelia at all. Vidal and his men use the mansion as a base to fight against the Republican rebels.Not the best of environments for an 11-year-old to be in, Ofelia stumbles upon the Labyrinth of Fauno (Pan, the Goat God, has nothing to do with this film, so I don't understand the English title) in the expansive mansion garden. Deep inside she finds Fauno, a sort of...well he's a mix of a lot of things. Imagine Darkness from Legend crossed with Mr. Tumnus, The Predator and Davy Jones. Fauno tells her that she is really the Princess of some Magical Kingdom. Her father, the King has been searching for her and has opened many portals to Earth. Fauno believes she is the one and tests her by ordering the completion of 3 bizarre tasks.The real world around Ofelia crumbles as Captain Vidal goes psycho, brutally murdering and torturing almost anyone he can. The rebels close in and her mother becomes very sick. Preferring Fauno's ghoulish tasks to witness murder on a daily basis, Ofelia becomes increasingly involved in her enigmatic Labyrinth world.In this respect it is very much like Catherine Storr's novel Marianne Dreams (and then the movie Paperhouse by Bernard Rose). Even Javier Navarrete's wonderful score sometimes reminded me of Hans Zimmer's score for Paperhouse. Definitely a CD I will have to get when it comes out! Despite the adult rating I would still take kids to see this. And by that I mean intelligent kids who are not addicted to Playstation and who don't mind subtitles. With so many crappy kids movies featuring talking animals a horror/drama shot from the point of view of an 11-year-old girl may just be the perfect cure."
the_english_mafia,"Nov 25, 2006",10/10,"To start with, can I just say quite simply: this is the best film I have ever seen. Ever. I had read many great reviews (including one from Mark Kermode who said it was the best film of the year) and so my expectations of it were through the roof. I imagined it could only disappoint. Pan's Labirynth is so extraordinary, I can barley begin to describe it in any way that would do it justice.Set in civil war Spain, Ofelia (brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero) meets a Faun who promises to take her to a mystical land, where she can live immortally, if she can complete three tasks. The fantastical aspects of the film are interwoven with the real world, where the brutal captain Vidal, recently married to Ofelia's mother, takes the fight to left-wing rebels.Pan's Labirynth is brutal and realistic and certainly one of the most violent films I've seen in a while, and I found my self looking away numerous times despite the many horror movies I've seen in the before. The violence is all in context and never feels exploitative or out of place. The film has an emotional power which I have never seen so well achieved in any film before, to such an extent I found myself in tears, several times. There are scarier elements to, such as 'the Pale Man' which is uncannily terrifying. Equally in the real word Sergi Lopez is a terrifying presence, particularly in the scenes of torture which he executes.I never thought a film would displace Apocalypse Now as my number one, but this has spectacularly. Honestly, if you only see one film this year, see this. It is truly life-changing."
esense,"Nov 24, 2006",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is without a doubt a work of genius. It is a more mature (and slightly more realistic) Miyazaki movie. There are the strong female leads, the oppressive and purely evil military figures, the amazing fantasy world. This film is Spirited Away gone to hell and came back passing through Neil Gaiman's Sandman.It is a joy to watch, it makes you yearn for the fantasy moments to escape the brutality of the ""reality"". Although there will be people who ""don't get it"" they have watched it and they will be affected by it. This movie moves your view of the world. It reminds you of your childhood dreaming and fantasizing.WATCH THIS FILM!"
dommercaldi,"Oct 6, 2020",6/10,"Pros:
1. The blood and gore looks epic and provides for some gnarly kills.
2. The set and costume design are awe-inspiring, particularly Fauno and the Pale Man (Doug Jones).
3. The CGI is really impressive and it more than holds 14 years later.
4. Doug Jones, Sergi López (Vidal), and Maribel Verdú (Mercedes) all deliver brilliant performances.
5. The score, despite being a little overplayed, lathers the movie in an ethereal atmosphere.Cons:
1. The lighting at night is blatantly artificial, and it looks ugly and distracting.
2. The score is needlessly overplayed at times.
3. The cartoonist presentation of Fascists as the bad guys, and the Communists as the good guys, is obnoxious and frustrating.
4. There are a few cheesy lines of dialogue that make the film feel like a soap opera.
5. There is too much focus on the Fascist/ Communist conflict, and not enough screen-time dedicated to the fantasy storyline."
elvoord,"Jan 29, 2007",1/10,"summary : A girl's fairy tale landed in pieces, in the middle of a soviet propaganda movie.The title & advert are promising a fantasy movie with nice decors. Decors you will have a very little bit. Fantazy as well, but both will be in fugacious minority. The main topic of the movie is : all bad, all evil Franco's troop will get kicked by all good, all innocent communist's rebels. I saw the movie yesterday in theater, and I feel myself very much betrayed by the whole movie. Be it the title, that diverts the attention. Be it the fairy tale that tries to cover the massive propaganda's background.Ridiculous unharmonious patchwork of pieces that juxtapose without link. A girl's fairy tale landed in pieces, in the middle of a soviet propaganda movie."
the_dimbster,"Mar 14, 2022",9/10,"This movie creates a fairy tale out of the Spanish Civil War, and it has much in common with traditional fairy tales (and with Life is Beautiful now that I think about it). Anyway, the imagination of a little girl in war torn Spain sure is a good way to quickly transition between extreme violence and whimsical beauty. Not a scene is wasted here. Everything each character does tells us something about that character, or tells us something about the naïveté/innocence of the world through a child's eyes. The design of the whimsical characters is inspired, and of course that eyeball guy is just so devastatingly scary! The scariest thing in the whole movie, though, is a man trying to live up to a legacy of violence. Seeing someone's face get bashed in by the villain for absolutely no reason tells us all we need to know about who the real monsters are. This is a great use of characterization, and in the first act, nonetheless. This is a beautiful movie with extreme violence and sad themes about war and power, but still beautiful."
njkagan,"Jan 27, 2007",10/10,"This is a tremendously powerful portrayal of fascism at the personal level. The acting is seamless especially the brilliant portrayal of Ofelia. As a side note, women are rendered with regard to their strength and character.While violent, the violence is illuminating both for the child's coping with trauma, the individual response to brutality and the social cost of violence. The fantasy serves both for it's ""otherworld"" aspect and the illuminating personal strength and sacrifice. The special effects are beautiful with fantastic characters rendered as believable. Certainly not a movie for children. I was blown away."
my_dimo,"Jan 27, 2007",10/10,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of the movie since I first heard of the project, and even more after seeing the trailers. I was not disappointed.Arriving at the cinema, the cashier told me this movie is subtitled because in Spanish, and asked me if I was put off. I answered that I was expecting it, and this was very important to my eyes. Indeed, Guillermo del Toro did amazingly well to resist any pressure or any temptation to shoot the movie in English, but I really think there was not even a doubt as to what language to use. This adds to the magic and the beauty of the movie.I am running out of superlatives to describe the movie, and my advice would be to go and see it for yourselves. It's a compelling tale of sadness, hope, innocence, passion, love, hate, power and drama. We are torn between two worlds: on one side the magical world of Ofelia, with its fairies, and on the other the cruel reality that is war. Both are extremely well mixed together and we are continuously drawn from one to the other with virtuoso handling from del Toro.The actors were all superb. Having seen Sergi Lopez from its french movies I was really blown away by the performance he gives as the Captain. Ivana Baquero is just perfect as Ofelia, and Maribel Verdu gives also a great performance. The supporting roles (particularly the doctor) are also very strong.I really hope Guillermo del Toro gets the recognition he greatly deserves, and wish this movie to stay on as one of the best of its kind for many decades to come. I can only conclude by advising you to see it and to be prepared for a lifetime experience"
zsigomiklos,"Jan 18, 2008",10/10,"Wow, wow, wow... While watching the end credits, I was thinking about all the great Spanish pieces of art I have ever seen ... The fantastic combination of all the colours and surrealistic paintings have mixed up at once in my mind. It is not a surprise that this amazing work won an Oscar for Cinematography. Guillermo Navarro and Del Torro had a beautiful dream coming true. The story is transferred on the screen incredibly, the creatures appearing in the vault are just like real(the faun, fairies, the terrifying eye-in-palm creature). I am not up to fantasy pictures, but this one moved my mind right from the start.The main idea for me is:What YOU believe, no one else does, because the OTHERS do not believe in a thing. Not to believe in anything is the cause of all the chaos and unrest in the world. Believing is something that makes our life a whole, whether it is true or not, whether we believe in something usual or even in a better world. Everything in the world is magic as long as we DO BELIEVE it is."
davidwestwell,"Dec 10, 2006",10/10,"This film deserves the Oscar for best film never mind best foreign film. The acting by all participants is an example to all aspiring actors. I went in to see this film with some trepidation but was amazed by the sheer simplicity of the story and the characterisations that carried the story throughout the film. The director has managed to incorporate both fantasy and reality in such away as to entice the audience to believe in his story. One word of question is that I think Spanish film makers are now attempting to rewrite Spanish history via films portraying the civil war, in such a way that the Republican army should have won this war and the Facists should never have come to power in the first place."
metsthr,"Jan 1, 2007",10/10,"I usually do not like movies in general, but as a history buff my uncle who is a director knows del Toro showed me this movie in a whim that I might like it.I had been studding Spanish for over five years now, and found I did not even look at the subtitles by the end of the film because the dialogue is easy to understand and the cinematography was done so well. del Toro also does a good job at blending fiction with reality, and mixing what occurred in history with what happened in Ofelia's life. This movie renewed my interest in movies, and I look forward to going back and watch del Toro's other films. I would recommend it to anyone."
canermustafa,"Jan 17, 2025",7/10,"""Pan'a Labyrinth"" is an undeniably beautiful and haunting film that masterfully blends fantasy and reality. Guillermo del Toro's vision is bold and imaginative, bringing to life a dark fairytale that feels both timeless and grounded in history. The story of Ofelia, a young girl navigating the horrors of Francoist Spain while escaping into a magical world, is compelling and layered, filled with symbolism and emotional depth.The film excels in its visuals. The cinematography is breathtaking, with rich, earthy tones and striking contrasts between the grim, oppressive real world and the eerie yet enchanting fantasy realm. The creature designs, particularly the Faun and the Pale Man, are both mesmerizing and unsettling, showcasing del Toro's talent for creating memorable and otherworldly characters.The performances are strong, with Ivana Baquero delivering a heartfelt portrayal of Ofelia. Sergi López is chilling as the cruel and calculating Capitan Vidal, embodying the brutality of the regime he represents. The supporting cast adds weight to the story, especially Maribel Verdú as the brave and compassionate Mercedes.However, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing can feel uneven at times, with some scenes dragging while others rush through crucial moments. While the fantasy elements are mesmerizing, they sometimes feel disconnected from the grim political backdrop, making the balance between the two worlds slightly jarring. Additionally, certain plot points feel predictable, which detracts from the overall sense of poetry and wonder.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a film that lingers in your mind long after it ends, thanks to its striking visuals and emotional core. While it doesn't fully reach its potential as a perfect blend of fantasy and historical drama, it is still a remarkable and ambitious piece of storytelling. It's a dark, poetic journey that's well worth experiencing, even if it falls short of being a masterpiece."
Flagrant-Baronessa,"Feb 9, 2007",10/10,"Now listen, I don't usually shower films with perfect tens, let alone those that are yet to stand the test of time, but I have to be honest here: I can't find anything tangibly wrong with Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Set against the backdrop of Franco's fascist repression in 1944, a young girl descends into fabled fantasy to escape the harsh reality of her step-father reign. This beautiful set-up is sheer darkly goosebumps-inducing magic, and the bitter everyday drama is almost as bitingly compelling.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is in this way neatly-composed of two parallel stories operating seamlessly in the same film, interweaving bucketloads of suspense in every single shot. On the realistic, reality-based end of the spectrum, we have Sergi López as the repressive big-shot Capitán Vidal, Ofelia's step-father. Although the latter brings wonderful wide-eyed intensity to her leading role, it is truly López who projects the most charisma in his performance, creating not a caricature of a villain, but a fully-fledged powerhouse of a tyrant.Ofelia is not as well-acted as she is well-written, it needs to be said. Yet this is understandable, for Del Toro gives us a no-holds-barred likable heroine who displays some of the most fearless antics you will see in films this year. She crawls through muddy hellholes with bugs on her legs. She visits demons. When she sees the iconic fearsome faun again, she runs up and hugs him. When her mother asks her to tell her unborn child a soothing bed-time story, Ofelia tells him dark nightmares, because they're stories to her.As for cinematography and the likes, the more CGI there is in a film, the more heart it needs to project. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" passes this criteria with flying colours because although the heaviest weapon in Guillermo Del Toro's directorial arsenal is undeniably his dark visuals, the wrapping story is so tear-jerkingly compelling that CGI typically takes a backseat to the drama in the film. The score, lullabies and all, is unspeakably disturbing  which tells me it is scored perfectly to a fantasy epic like this.Yes, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a foreign film, foreign not only in its speaking language, but in its visual linguistics and imagination. The whole world created on the colour-awash screen is alien to most people, and atmospheric originality goes a long way. In the end, the film is a self-spun cocoon of childhood magic laced with dark notions, something like a NC-17 version of Alice in Wonderland  something absolutely extraordinary.10 out of 10"
swift-swift,"Oct 19, 2006",9/10,"Pan's Labyrinth tempts you in from the first beautiful second. Rather like entering a labyrinth you quickly leave the light and enter dark, mysterious tunnels which promise a new shock around each corner, both fantastical and brutally human. This is not a labyrinth you would take a child.Sergi Lopez broods a performance so devilishly vile the audience literally recoiled when he was on screen. His blood chilling psycopath in fascist breeches should walk him into the Oscar running, if not he should consider taking his toolbox around to the Academy members and asking them why not.The rest of the cast perform with subtle class, especially the young girl who proves that young actors do not need to be force fed sugar cubes for 6 months before shooting. Credit for this must go to the Director who is, for me anyway, deserving of all the acclaim he is receiving.The film is unrelenting in its turns into fantasy and back again, flashing us back into into cruelty of real life.My only fear is that its stark violence and Spanish language might restrict the size of its audience. This is, of course, what makes the film all the more special. It is wonderfully believable and in fantasy, that is truly everything."
Philby-3,"Feb 10, 2007",9/10,"I've not seen any of Guillermo del Toro's earlier films, but this one places him, along with Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuaron, as a Spanish-American film-maker with broad appeal. This film (unlike ""Babel"") sticks within one very specific cultural milieu, Franco's Spain in 1944 seen through the eyes of Ofelia, an 11 year old girl whose widowed mother has been desperate enough to marry a particularly zealous and nasty fascist army officer. Not surprisingly she escapes into her own world of fantasy, in which she is a princess of the underworld trying to find her way home.The film is stacked full of good performances. Ivana Banquero, is stunning as Ofelia, and Sergi Lopez is completely convincing as her ruthless and single-minded stepfather, Captain Vidal. Maribel Verdu as Mercedes the housekeeper also puts in a strong performance, as does Alex Angulo as the doctor and Doug Jones as Pan and the Pale Man (aided by some terrific costume design).It is interesting that while the fascists are portrayed as the bad guys del Toro makes an attempt to explain what drives them. In one dinner scene the local notables are entertained by Vidal to a sumptuous feast (while everyone around is on strict rations). After the third or so round of drinks he announces that all men are not equal, ""we won the war and therefore deserve the best."" His listeners (except for the doctor) enthusiastically agree. Vidal, desperate for a son, is also motivated by tradition; his father was an army general who died in battle, for Vidal ""the only way to die"". But he is also a sadist  his interrogations go long past mere military brutality. Perhaps the message is you don't have to be a sadist to be a good fascist, but it helps.The resistance are of course portrayed as the good guys, but their tactics are as brutal as those of the military, shooting the wounded where they fall, for example. They also find it hard to accept that the war is over, and they are merely the subject of a mopping-up operation headed up by a real bastard very happy in his work.Most of the action takes place in a gloomy and surprisingly wet forest so well evoked we can almost smell the mud. The fantasy sequences owe something to Lewis Carroll as well as Mervyn Peake - ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Gormenghast"" (Pan has a little in common with the White Rabbit). Visually, this is a terrific film.The good guys did win out in the end, but it took another 30 years, and happened peacefully. The speed at which Spain has left its fascist past behind tells us something, I think."
rgarzagrande,"Feb 25, 2007",10/10,"I have seen a lot of comments about the violence in this film, and frankly I'm disappointed in the people who are posting them. This is not a children's movie. This is not a fairy tale. If you were looking for that, perhaps Narnia would be more to your liking.The fairy tale world that this girl inhabits is a form of escape from the realities of her life. Those realities include neglect, they include injustice, and of course, they include violence. The viewer has to see that, and they must feel it too. To not show the violence and not elicit that visceral reaction in the viewer defeats the purpose of the whole movie.Stop being such prudes."
jocondeus,"Dec 30, 2007",10/10,"What a master piece really! This is one excellent movie, I was amazed by the attention to details, the music, the make-up, the acting, the lines and the story. Everything was so perfect. This movie is so well done that the story would be believable although it is a science fiction/fantasy genre. I have watched it three times back to back, I am surprised this movie took only three awards. The story is written with such an intelligence and it was matched with perfect music, make-up, decor, acting, directing, producing, perfect in everything indeed. The translation, I mean the English subtitles are wrong of course as they always are with any and every movie that is subtitled in English no matter what the source language is, but that has nothing to do with the movie makers of course (you would think there are no good translators on earth or no translators at all). Anyway, Del Torro, you have outdone yourself this time! Bravo, Bravissimo! Congratulations to you and your team on your outstanding work! Looking forward to see your next movie."
Quinoa1984,"Jan 5, 2007",10/10,"Guillermo Del-Toro goes into full bloom with a real feat of cinematic strength with Pan's Labyrinth, the kind of film that builds more and more with momentum until one's left in a total engrossment in the storytelling and the fates of the characters (mainly the little girl of the story, Ivana Baquero's Ofelia). Del-Toro knows that since his movie is mainly more for adults than the kids (I wouldn't not recommend it to kids, but the younger ones would definitely get freaked out by the more gruesomely violent moments), it should really be provocative by way of showing how a child has no other choice but to go into the realm of one's fantasies. But on further introspection about the movie, what makes it even more fascinating is how, in a strange way, it's not escapism in the sense that the girl retreats to the dreamworld. If anything the dreamworld retreats to her, or rather each side of fantasy and reality have an equal pertinence here, unlike another film from this past year, the (underlooked) Terry Gilliam film Tideland, where a little girl also had to escape under no other recourse to which it transformed her own world-view to a great degree. Pan's Labyrinth blends together a unique form of magical realism that grows more potent and aborbing on a repeat viewing, and it's actually stronger by showing how the fantastical can be contrasted with what's really terrifying and cruel in the world.In this case it comes in the form of fascism and a kind of rule-by-law/fear, and in the form of the little girl's step-father, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, formerly of With a Friend Like Harry). His is one of the great antagonist performances I've seen in recent memory, though mostly because of Del-Toro making him such a force of domination and cruelty on anyone who doesn't fit into his obedience and world-view. He and his troops are facing off against the rebels in the area circa 1940s Franco-run Spain, and has no tolerance for anyone in his midst who won't go under his form of justice (there's an immediate form of repulsion by what he does, graphically, to father and son peasants who only were in the woods after rabbits). The stakes become raised, however, when his troops capture one of the rebels alive, and after torture, there's recognition among some of the caretakers in his home, like the good doctor- who is there really to take care of the Captain's very pregnant wife and mother of Ofelia- and the head maid of the household (the great Maribel Verdu as Mercedes), and suddenly Ofelia finds herself pit against this man that she could never stand to begin with, but now sees as a true threat to what she has to accomplish.And what she has to accomplish is the more fantastical portion of the picture, a very strange but completely illuminating set of scenes where we find that Ofelia really has the spirit of an underworld princess in her, and a faun (er, 'Pan'), gets her to complete tasks in order to set the spirit free. But in the face of the Captain, and her own mother's weakened spirit (which leads to a very sad state of affairs), it becomes the greatest struggle of Ofelia's life, and all in the midst of a political conflict settled in this environment with guns and overwrought bloodshed that she couldn't even begin to understand. Hence, the escapism. But part of the greatness in Pan's Labyrinth- aside from the tremendous technical accomplishments on all fronts (cinematography, production and creature design, special/visual effects, the attention to detail with both the historical and more fairy-tale aspects)- is that we really care about Ofelia's struggle, as she's really in a dire situation when she has to snap back from her time with the insects/fairies and meetings with the faun. Through the bleakness that surrounds her, one can see how the fantasy is not just a sweet desire, but a necessity in youth- however one might want it as an adult as well.Filled with heart and ideas, a climax that really becomes moving and captivating without becoming too sentimental, and with some individual scenes that rank with the best in the decade (Lopez's scene where he stitches back his own face- and then takes a drink of alcohol- is priceless, ditto for when Ofelia has to get the dagger from the banquet hall), this is a real marvel of ""magical realism"", as it's been dubbed, and is surely Del-Toro's triumph so far as a filmmaker (and, like Gilliam, visionary to boot)."
hellholehorror,"Oct 16, 2025",6/10,I loved this fantastic adult fairytale about a little girl caught up in a very grownup world but also inhabiting a fantasy world at night. This is one fantasy that is certainly not for children. There is some hefty violence for what could masquerade as a children's film. The monsters are actually quite scary and gave me quite an intense ride from start to end. The whole film looks utterly visually stunning. I just can't help but feel that it's favouring style over depth. A good fairy tale set to the backdrop of horrific events. Beautiful imagery.
HarshCritic69,"Jan 19, 2007",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece. It paints a dark and disturbing picture about the horrors of war and how an innocent, imaginative child copes with her gruesome reality.CAVEAT: THIS ""FANTASY"" MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU EXPECT!Note to those who are expecting a romantic escapist fantasy flick - this is a VERY DARK and disturbing movie, not for the light hearted and impressionable. Definitely NOT for children. Definitely NOT a ""date"" movie, unless afterwords you plan to spend a detox session at home sipping warm milk, watching Teletubbies. And I thought that ""Se7en"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" were romantic comedies. Some scenes will make even the most hardened of the audience members cringe. Be warned.Is it a Fantasy, as advertised? It certainly has faeries, fauns and other creatures that would legitimize this description. However, these are no elves of Tolkien's Middle Earth nor are they centaurs of Narnia. These guys are straight out of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch's ""Hell"" or Goya's ""Saturn, devouring his children"". Are they real? Or are they the product of little girl's fantasy whose imagination has been twisted by indiscriminate brutality of the Spanish Civil war? You be the judge.While this was not exactly what I expected to see going into the movie theater, I was totally blown away: the acting, visual effects, scenery, music, camera work - all were absolutely wonderful. Pan's labyrinth is a cinematic masterpiece. Just know what you are getting into and if you are up to it, watch it!.. and then take a cold shower."
wavecat13,"Jan 7, 2019",7/10,"Awesome special effects are the best thing about this film from writer/director/ producer Guillermo del Toro. A little girl discovers a weird fantasy land that helps her cope with the pain and trouble all around her - an evil, macho, fascist stepfather, a seriously ill mother, and the Spanish Civil War raging in the woods outside of the estate/garrison that she recently moved into. It is an effective blend of fantasy and reality, but there is a problem. The fantasy world stuff is lively, creepy, and intense - but the ordinary world provides pretty standard violent melodrama, and is not as effective. A recent BBC critics poll placed this in the top 20 films since 2000."
Fernando_FL,"Aug 1, 2014",10/10,"To be honest, the first time I listened to the name of this movie, i never imagined anything like this, because i used have the bad habit to judge before to see. Anyway it seems to me now that i'm a fanatic of these kind of movies, that the context of a real world can make us more and more imaginative, beyond the things we believe and thought. For me this is a weird but beautiful example of the power of imagination that the director Del Toro can give us. I didn't remember what exactly did I do when movie finished, i just smiled, watched the credits scrolling, heard the beautiful music and then i put the movie on its box. Nothing else. Something happened. I can't describe that effect that Pan's Labyrinth gave me to me, but it was beautiful. Cry or smile, or cry while smiling. Only a genius could make that piece of cinematographic art. I liked for many reasons. One of them, it's spoken in Spanish, the atmosphere of tension that comes together when the war combined with a strong Spanish accent gives emotion to the movie. And then, the tranquility. All the actors getting deep into his character. A combined rhythm that shows different contexts of two different worlds. Doesn't matter what you believe, it's your choice. I recommend this movie for those who want to see something weird, but something that can prove itself the worth of a young soul. There's a prequel, which is based in the same context. (The devil's backbone). The idea of have a child on the main character for me is such as see the innocent life turned into something that they wouldn't be able to do.That's why i loved it."
paulclaassen,"Jul 2, 2018",10/10,"Amazing visual effects makes this one of the best foreign language films I've ever seen, and quite frankly one of my favorite films of all time. The interesting plot comes wonderfully to life with fascinating visuals and good acting, notably Sergi Lopez as the antagonist. This is simply brilliance on every level!!"
joerowling,"Apr 28, 2013",10/10,"This movie is one of the greatest ever made. The visual effects are some of the most engaging and impressive that I have seen and I have seen a lot of movies. It is not so much impressive in the way that CG is in Avatar but it is on it's own level. You just have to see it to understand. The story is very heavy and powerful. Some scenes were so shocking and powerful that I was actually shaking. There are horror movies that deal with strange and unlikely things like zombies, and don't get me wrong I love a good zombie or vampire movie. However, a film like this one that deals with war in a very smart and real way has a much bigger impact when something really bad happens than a movie that is clearly make believe. This movie deals with make believe and the surreal in a way that few other movies have been able to pull off well. What Dreams Come attempted this and did not quite hit the mark, this movie does a much better job of contrasting and blending what is real and what is imagination. Brilliant, brilliant movie. If you have a problem with subtitles do not waste your time, you will be disappointed and want to give the movie an unfair low rating which is an ignorant English speaking person thing to do. If you can deal with subtitles, watch this movie."
trdzurinda,"Jan 21, 2016",9/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of those movies that carries a message through its visuals and even tells a story with few words. Many of the images resemble fear, greed, happiness, and despair. No one is safe when you go astray from the path you were meant to be on. I absolutely loved the direction in this flick. Every shot seemed to be tight, focused, and captured the mood the scene is creating. Obviously the visuals is what makes this movie so amazing and it deserves that merit. the use of makeup and real set pieces rather than the CGI saturated world we live in now is why I will always love this movie. If people can get past reading subtitles throughout and enjoy what this movie brings to the table, then I absolutely recommend this movie to be watched by everyone before they die."
bhanu2293,"Mar 4, 2014",10/10,"I am a huge fantasy aficionado. Films like Blancanieves, LOTR series and Miyazaki's works are my personal favorites. I knew that Del Toro was a fine film-maker when it came to telling a dark fantasy story. So, when the credits started rolling, i knew that i had seen one of the best films of all time. The real beauty lies in the fact that Del Toro manages to blend Spanish civil war and a beautifully lavish fantasy world together. The film is brutal yet magical. This is a fairy-tale for grown ups where Ofelia's child-like imagination runs free yet the world created by her is full of horror. As far as acting goes it is Sergi López's fantastic portrayal of Vidal that caught my eye. His performance is chilling enough to make you hate the captain. Ivana Baquero portrays Ofelia with a nuance which is beyond her years. And lastly it is Guillermo Navarro's masterful cinematography that breathes life in every scene. A true masterpiece which is sure to remain a high benchmark for fantasy films in years to come."
BaphometDreams,"Mar 10, 2022",9/10,"I think Guillermo del Toro has achieved what he wanted to do: to create a tale that is authentic, that feels old, told for generations before reaching us.Not only that, but as a film, it stands very high in terms of: an engaging story with beautiful cinematography, well crafted decor and period costumes.The actors are well chosen; we follow Ofelia as the protagonist and we are truly by her side from start to finish which reinforces the impact of her discoveries and trials, both in the post civil war Spain and in the magical realm.It is a story that contains many emotions like a true fairy tale, guiding us through the best and worst of human nature from the innocent and imaginative point of view of a 10 years old in time of war."
springland,"Dec 29, 2018",7/10,"I just this movie a couple days ago. My bf insisted me to watched saying how he liked Pan's Labyrinth a lot. At first, I was skeptic toward to watch it because I thought it would be some kind of cliche fantasy movie. But I was totally wrong. Guillermo de Toro delivered a very beautiful yet tragic story. I said it is not cliche because first it is a dark fantasy with bloody scenes (I thought the movie was a happy-journey thing). And I love when the character is faced with danger there is not a suddenly-hero-come from nowhere to help him/ her. Mercedes is the character I favorite most. She is strong, brave and smart. I felt like clapping when she brutally attack the captain. Besides, I hate the main character most, Ofelia. Though it is still understandable because she is still a kid and innocent (or stupid? why do you eat the grape?!). Oh and the myth creatures are astonishing!
To sum up, this movie worth to watch. This is not a usual fantasy. This is rare."
ArtemisDeApollo,"Apr 2, 2025",10/10,"As a viewer who loves dark fantasy films that blend rich storytelling with stunning visuals, Pan's Labyrinth was an unforgettable experience that left an impression on me. From the moment the film began, I was drawn into its hauntingly beautiful world, where fairy-tale magic and brutal historical reality intertwine seamlessly. At a runtime of approximately 119 minutes (about 4 hours), the film masterfully balances its intricate narrative with breathtaking visuals, ensuring that every moment is immersive and meaningful.One of the most striking aspects of Pan's Labyrinth is its extraordinary use of SFX makeup and practical effects, which breathe life into the film's most haunting creatures. The grotesque yet mesmerizing design of the Pale Man and the Faun highlights the meticulous craftsmanship behind their eerie, lifelike appearances. Doug Jones's performances, combined with the intricate prosthetics and animatronics, make these characters feel disturbingly real, adding to the film's immersive quality. The Faun, with his ancient, enigmatic presence, is particularly captivating-and my personal favorite character. His blend of wisdom and ambiguity leaves viewers questioning whether he is a benevolent guide or a manipulative force, making him one of the most intriguing figures in dark fantasy cinema.The film's cinematography is breathtaking, with its moody lighting and rich color palette enhancing the contrast between Ofelia's fantastical adventures and the harsh, war-torn Spain of 1944. The music, composed by Javier Navarrete, is hauntingly beautiful, with its lullaby-like themes adding to the film's dreamlike yet melancholic tone.What sets Pan's Labyrinth apart from other dark fantasy films is its emotional depth; unlike typical fairy tales, the story does not shy away from loss, sacrifice, and the cruel realities of war. Compared to similar films like The Devil's Backbone or Coraline, Pan's Labyrinth carries a more profound historical and emotional weight while still maintaining the eerie wonder of a dark fairy tale. The film's villain, Captain Vidal, is one of the most chilling antagonists in cinema, his cold brutality making him just as terrifying as any supernatural creature.The way director Guillermo del Toro balances fantasy with stark realism makes this film more than just a fairy tale-it is a tragic yet beautiful meditation on innocence and resistance in the face of cruelty. Pan's Labyrinth is rated R, meaning it is best suited for mature audiences due to its intense violence and disturbing themes. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates visually stunning, deeply emotional storytelling, though those expecting a lighthearted fantasy should prepare for its dark and unsettling themes."
TheMovieSearch,"Sep 21, 2025",7/10,"Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films that immediately announces itself as something visually unforgettable, long before you fully grasp the story it's telling. For years I only knew it through images-the Faun's towering presence, the eerie fairies, the bone-white terror of the Pale Man-but actually watching the film revealed a far deeper and more emotionally devastating experience. Set in 1944 Francoist Spain, the film follows young Ofelia as she navigates both the horrors of war and the haunting pull of a dark, mythical realm. This duality is what makes the film so gripping: it's not simply a fantasy, nor simply a wartime drama, but a collision of both in the harshest way possible.At its core, the film is about Ofelia's identity as Princess Moanna, heir to the Underworld, and the chilling set of tasks she must complete to prove herself worthy of returning home. These tasks weave between the real world and the magical one, each more dangerous and symbolic than the last. Her encounters with the Faun create a constant tension-he is equal parts guide and threat, someone whose motives are never fully clear. The line between help and manipulation is razor-thin, and that uncertainty gives the film much of its unsettling energy.Where Pan's Labyrinth truly becomes unforgettable is in its unflinching portrayal of brutality. The violence in the real world is graphic, cold, and heartbreaking, anchored by Captain Vidal, played with horrifying precision by Sergi López. He embodies a cruelty that almost overshadows the monsters of the fantasy world-almost. Meanwhile, the fantastical creatures, though mesmerizing in design, are far from comforting. The Pale Man sequence alone is one of the most disturbing and memorable scenes in modern cinema, cementing the film's status as a dark fairy tale meant strictly for adults.Despite its darkness, the film is astonishingly beautiful. The cinematography captures both the bleakness of war and the mesmerizing elements of fantasy with equal finesse. Every frame feels intentional, layered with meaning from color choices to lighting to creature movement. Ivana Baquero delivers a remarkable performance as Ofelia, grounding the film with innocence and determination, while the supporting cast strengthens the emotional core. Even the smallest roles contribute to the film's sense of lived-in reality and palpable danger.Del Toro's direction and screenplay work in perfect harmony. He builds a world where fantasy becomes an extension of trauma-not an escape from it. The storytelling is patient, deliberate, and deeply symbolic, inviting interpretations about obedience, sacrifice, innocence, and the cost of resistance. It's the kind of narrative that lingers with you, not because it offers answers, but because it dares to challenge you with its ambiguity and emotional weight.That said, Pan's Labyrinth is not a film everyone will want to revisit, myself included. Its beauty is matched by its brutality, and while I admire the craftsmanship, performances, and imagination behind every detail, it is emotionally heavy in a way that makes it difficult to return to. Still, its impact is undeniable. This is a film that continues to influence cinema, remains visually iconic, and resonates deeply with audiences who appreciate the intersection of fantasy and historical tragedy. Even if it isn't a rewatchable movie for me personally, I fully understand why it stands as a masterpiece in modern filmmaking."
bdubstater4,"Jan 6, 2007",1/10,"I had an entirely different review for this movie written and posted, but after hearing more and more people comment on this ""mystical, haunted wonderland of a movie"", I had to re-write my comment, more out of anger than anything else. First, let me set some guidelines. This is a great movie. It was made with a lot of skill and talent, it is a different approach to story telling and there is a lot to be admired. However, one thing that I simply cannot stand anymore is how exponentially increasing masses of people keep calling this ""one of the best fantasy's ever"", ""a dark and horrific, yet wonderfully creative trip down the rabbit hole"". People, if this is one of the best fantasy's ever, or even of recent times, then all that means is our expectations of what a fantasy should be are sorely lacking. Throughout the entire movie, there are two, count them, TWO scenes that are pure fantasy, and neither one lasts more than perhaps four minutes. The rest of the fantasy takes place in real life situations with subtle hints of fantasy or one or two fantasy characters appearing to talk to the girl. Again, don't jump down my throat too quickly, these scenes are interesting to watch and for light touches of fantasy I think it was very well done, but by no means whatsoever can a movie that is 75% war drama and 25% fantasy, if that, be considered an ""enchanting and mysterious fairy tale"". If anything, it is a dark war drama with innovative and well crafted flairs of fantasy interwoven, but stop reviewing this movie in ways that are going to mislead people into thinking they are going to see a flood of creative and magical imagery!Possible SpoilersAs a final point, I think the biggest flaw in this movie is that I couldn't help but feel all the mystical elements of the story were, in the end, pointless. They in no way connect to the real world and are more like interesting side notes into the delusions of a little girl while the real world ticks on around her. Say what you will about the themes about losing one's innocence, and how the fantasy might have been real, either way there is a feeling of disappointment when the girl drops dead at the end and we think, ""why did she do all this again? What does this have to do with ANYTHING else we've seen in the movie?"" I was looking for a greater sense of importance to the girl's story. Perhaps the writers weren't going for that, which is fine, but it would have made the movie more enjoyable for me."

Melissatho,"Jan 1, 2014",9/10,"I thought this was one of the best sub-titled movies I have ever watched. I forgot I was even reading the words after five minutes. I would usually not watch a movie this type, that I couldn't understand and so must read sub titles, (it can distract me from the movie) but this movie kept my interest enough to not notice, it's a very interesting movie.The story really grabbed my imagination, I loved the characters and thought they were really well done. When I saw the preview to this, that is what caught my attention the most, now seeing the movie it did not disappoint.The story was very heart felt, and the Labyrinth and characters made a hard impression on my feelings toward this story. The movie ended on a great note, and didn't leave me feeling like something was missing.I would watch this movie again, I think it's worth it."
filipemanuelneto,"Feb 14, 2022",8/10,"I think this film was really my first contact with the work of Guillermo del Toro, a Mexican director who has done a colossal job of taking advantage of fantastic themes in his films. This film was one of the director's most cherished projects, and we can feel how much he committed and invested in it. Despite being a fantasy film and starring a girl, the film is quite intense and not suitable for younger children.All the action takes place in the final years of the Spanish Civil War: we follow Ofelia, a dreamy and kind-hearted girl, who travels to a remote place in rural Spain with her mother, in order to join Captain Vidal, a superior officer of the Francoist army whose mother got pregnant and who occupied an abandoned mill with a battalion to hunt down a group of communist partisans. From the start, it is quite clear that Ofelia dislikes her stepfather and her mother is determined to make her forget her real father, now deceased, by forcing the girl to treat him as a father. Indifferent to political issues, Ofelia pursues and finds a magical world in the forest around her new habitat. There, she meets a faun who tells her that she is, in fact, a princess, daughter of the King of the Enchanted World, who long ago left and was lost in the human world, living without knowing the anguish and longing for her true father. In order to return, she will need to complete three challenges and prove that her soul is still pure, that is, that she has not turned into a human.If we want to do a cold and harshly realistic analysis, this film will quickly crumble and show several weaknesses. The most obvious, for me, is the absolute insanity of a military man who insists on taking his companion, in a terminal stage of pregnancy, and a minor child to the battlefield. I also didn't like the feeling that the film ends up being so politically charged, with communist guerrillas being considered champions of freedom and with the demonization of Francoist soldiers. Anyone knows that there are no saints in war, and that atrocities are always committed on both sides. But I feel that we are being unfair if we continue to view the film from this perspective. Despite all this, this is a charming cinematographic work full of magic and dreaminess, which makes us want to believe in fairy tales again, to be in that girl's shoes.The film has an excellent cast of Hispanic actors (I don't know if they are all Spanish in fact) and is entirely spoken in Spanish, which for me was a bonus as it gives the film a very welcome additional realism. Ivana Baquero did an exceptional job on the skin of young Ofelia. Despite not showing his face, very well disguised, Doug Jones is the man who gives body, soul and life to two of the most memorable characters in the film: the wise faun and the terrible Pale Man, a monster that almost devours the protagonist. Jones gives us one of his best works in cinema. Surprisingly calm and terrifying, Sergi López turned his Captain into a character worthy of our hatred and contempt. In addition to these three great actors, the film also has splendid performances by Ariadna Gil, Maribel Verdú, Álex Angulo and César Vea.Being a Del Toro film, it is guaranteed that we will have a wide range of visual effects, CGI and characterization, all the highest quality and privileging the maximum of realism. In fact, we couldn't ask for more when it comes to all of this. There are a number of discreet and realistic CGI features, ranging from explosions and the intense green of the forest to the maze itself, fantastic and unreal, where an important part of the story takes place. The costumes are very good, especially Ofelia's dresses and the soldiers' uniforms. The scenarios, especially the labyrinth and the mill, are wonderful and the characterization of the fantastic characters was thought out in the smallest details. Cinematography makes clever use of color, shadow, light and shooting angles to achieve greater expressiveness and visual symbolism. No less important is the excellent soundtrack, with emphasis on the central melody, which has a sound that reminds us of the lullabies that mothers used to sing to children."
amyz214,"Aug 4, 2018",7/10,"I have become a big fan of Guillermo del Toro ever since watching Pan's Labyrinth and Shape of Water. Where Guillermo lacks plot-line, he makes up for in style and cinematic beauty. I dont think the story line of Pan's Labyrinth is fantastic per say, it definitely felt very loosely written, and I did not expect the film to be so heavily based around the war and so little on the actual labyrinth. But regardless, Guillermo's cinematic style is absolutely astounding. The fantastic creatures, the art, and the mood in each scene captivates how magical Ophelia's fantasy world was. I will forever love Guillermo's 40's-50's vibe in his films"
masekokeith,"Feb 22, 2025",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a mesmerizing and unforgettable film that combines fantasy and reality in a unique and powerful way. I just enjoyed every second of it i feel like watching it over and over again. At its heart, Pan's Labyrinth is not just a fantasy film it is a commentary on the human condition, particularly the resilience of the human spirit in the face of fascism, oppression, and cruelty. Captain Vidal embodies the tyranny of Franco-era Spain, a man consumed by power and control, while Ofelia represents purity and innocence, desperately trying to maintain her sense of wonder and belief in goodness amidst a world falling apart. The juxtaposition of these two worlds - one magical and beautiful, the other violent and bleak serves as a powerful exploration of childhood innocence in a time."
JaxxWebb,"Sep 23, 2024",7/10,"Pre-Watch Thoughts:
The title, *Pan's Labyrinth*, hints at a story rooted in mythology. With ""Pan"" representing the Greek god of nature and the labyrinth often symbolizing a complex journey or challenge, I expected the film to explore mystical themes, nature, and perhaps a journey filled with trials and symbolic meaning.Cinematography:
The cinematography, while effective, is not particularly experimental. The use of color, especially the cooler blue lighting at night, sets the mood well, but it doesn't push boundaries. The transitions between scenes are smooth and well-executed, yet visually, the film sticks to traditional techniques without venturing into more innovative territory.Rating: (3/5)Mise-en-scène:
The film excels in its detailed production design, blending practical effects and CGI to create an immersive experience. However, the reliance on CGI in certain moments might feel a bit overdone for those who prefer more practical effects. The richly detailed setting feels grim and lacks the vibrancy that could balance the darker elements.Rating: (4/5)Sound Design:
The sound design is well-crafted and helps build the atmosphere, but the film's score may feel repetitive at times. While it successfully underscores the emotional beats, the soundtrack doesn't quite stand out in a memorable way beyond the viewing experience.Rating: (3/5)Storytelling and Narrative:
The film tells two intertwined stories, seamlessly blending the real and the fantastical. However, the pacing can feel slow in parts, especially when the film lingers too long on either storyline. The narrative's ambiguity may leave some viewers wanting more clarity, while others might appreciate its open-ended nature.Rating: (4/5)Final Thoughts:
""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a visually captivating and emotionally resonant film that mixes fantasy with historical drama. While it may not break new ground in its cinematography or sound design, it offers a well-crafted and immersive experience. Overall, it effectively explores deep themes and delivers a powerful message."
ismamuzzaman,"Apr 20, 2022",8/10,"An incredibly unique, devastatingly beautiful film, with a simple, but effectively engaging plot, masterful editing, that seamlessly blends reality with fantasy, that's complimented by the film's beautiful cinematography and amazing performances by the cast, especially Ivana Baquero."
jimbo-53-186511,"Apr 9, 2013",8/10,"Pan's labyrinth is a truly wonderful experience and right from the start the viewer is treated to some beautiful visuals. But this film is a lot more than just being pretty to look at and beyond the excellent visuals, the viewer is treated to a captivating story.The main star of the film is Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero) and considering she was only 12 years old when the film was made I thought her acting was really good - arguably the only acting that was as good as/better than Baquero's was Sergi Lopez whose performance as the evil captain Vidal (Ofelia's step-dad) was also excellent. We also have Mercedes (played by Maribel Verdu) Carmen (Ofelia's mum - played by Ariadna Gil) and the doctor (played by Alex Angulo) in supporting roles.Another of the film's strengths is the pacing - although the film is nearly 2 hours long, you won't even notice the time passing - the film's main plot covers Ofelia and her fairytale world within the Labyrinth and we also have a sub plot involving Captain Vidal and his war against 'The Guerillas'.Pan's labyrinth is beautiful to look at, has a wonderful story, is well acted with a strong script. I would strongly recommend checking it out"
pulpficat,"Feb 8, 2024",9/10,"Directed by the visionary Guillermo del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is a spellbinding journey that weaves together the harsh realities of post-Civil War Spain and the enchanting realm of fairy tales. At its heart is Ofelia, a young girl whose imagination becomes her refuge from the brutality of the world around her.The narrative unfolds like the pages of a storybook, with a delicate balance between the harshness of the real world, represented by the stern Captain Vidal, and the ethereal wonders Ofelia discovers in the labyrinth. Ofelia's journey is a poignant exploration of innocence and resilience, and the film's narrative crescendos and decrescendos are orchestrated with a finesse that resonates. There's love, sacrifice, betrayal, and redemption, all beautifully entwined in a tale that unfolds like a delicate waltz.Pan's Labyrinth captures the essence of fairy tales, where darkness and light coexist in a delicate dance. It's a testament to the power of imagination as a refuge, a sanctuary where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary. Guillermo del Toro has crafted a film that lingers in the heart. His visual style is so unique; it's like he painted each frame with a palette of nightmares and dreams. The labyrinth itself is like a twisted wonderland, filled with creatures straight out of a fever dream. From the hauntingly beautiful faun to the captivatingly eerie Pale Man, each creature is a stroke of artistic genius that dances on the edges of reality and myth.The film doesn't shy away from the darkness of war, and it's like del Toro decided to hit us right in the feels with the brutality and hopelessness of that era. But then, just when you think it can't get any darker, the fantasy elements kick in, and the magic of cinema envelops you like a warm embrace.Pan's Labyrinth is a visual feast, a dark and twisted fairy tale that's as emotionally gripping as it is visually stunning. It's a cinematic rollercoaster that'll leave you questioning reality, and perhaps, make you appreciate the real magic that lies in the power of imagination."
turnmaxw,"Oct 3, 2024",10/10,"I cannot think of a single film that has stuck with me from the first time I watched it more than this one. Guillermo del Toro beautifully encapsulates what it may feel like to be a young girl dealing with change, death, and tragedy on a day-to-day basis. It pretends to be a fairytale taking place in the heart of Fascist Spain but instead, it describes what it feels like to be a young girl living in that society, the fairytales are her coping mechanism, her way of explaining and living in everything that happens around her. I could say so much more, but this is only a review and I haven't the time.I'll leave it with a simple point. Ofelia had the power to hope, to believe that there was something greater, that she was something greater than a mere girl in the grips of death...maybe we can too."
thijsvanvliet,"May 26, 2019",8/10,I think that this is a great movie and It tries to send a message that in the hardest times you can always find a good place and your own fantasy world. When I first heard the title of this movie I thought it was going to be very bad and with no message but it tries to send a great message. The only thing I think was bad of the movie was the violence there was to much violence in the movie and I think that it should not be that much. Overall I think this is a great movie.
ben_alefosio,"Jan 18, 2014",9/10,"The way Del Toro balances this story between the cruel reality of the Spanish civil war and the wonder of this realm he's created is perfect. This is one of the purest fantasy movies I've seen, and it's beautiful throughout, even in scenes without Ofelia and her imagination present. Behind the gloom is a strong family tale; Ofelia's love for her mother, the struggles Mercedes goes through with her brother, and Captain Vidal's strained history with his father. This instills heart to what could easily be nothing more than a florid piece, regarded purely for it's dress-up (which is incredible).The performances were also great. Ivana Bacquero and Maribel Verdu were standouts, but it's Sergi Lopez's embodiment of evil as Captain Vidal that leaves the biggest impression. As far as movie villains go, he'd have to be up there with the best. Credit is due also to Doug Jones, the man who is usually behind the amazing costumes in GDT films. His movements as The Faun and The Pale Man ranged from powerful and intimidating to absolutely terrifying. Extra credit too for learning Spanish.This film is a remarkable achievement, not just for Spanish cinema but cinema as a whole. It should be remembered as one of the most riveting pieces of dark fantasy. Guillermo Del Toro is a genius and master of this genre, and the people behind the scenes who work with costumes, set designs, FX etc. are incredible.A movie I would recommend that's similar in terms of dream-like fantasy and a completely visceral feel is a 2006 film called The Fall. I wouldn't rate it as highly as Pan's Labyrinth but it's definitely a good film in it's own right, and worth checking out.Sweet, thanks for reading yo!"
acidburn-10,"Feb 12, 2025",10/10,"'Pan's Labyrinth' is a creative, dreamlike, scary and utterly captivating Spanish/Mexican fantasy horror flick written, directed and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro. Historical and grounded in its setting, but otherworldly and mystical in its storytelling that you can't help but fall into from the very start and it never lets up right up until its final moments. This is a stunningly gripping presentation packs a compelling narrative, incredible visuals and emotional depth into a complete package making this a dark fairytale masterpiece for the ages.The Plot = Set in 1944 Spain during the Spanish Civil War, a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is sent to live with her cruel stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). At night she meets a fairy who takes to an old faun Pan (Doug Jones) who tells her that she's a princess but must prove her loyalty by surviving three gruesome tasks.The movie effectively combines well-staged fantasy sequences with the gritty and downbeat real world Civil War elements thanks to its compelling script that balances everything perfectly as well as Del Toro's visual trademark flair which renders everything you see on screen so perfectly that it takes you a fantastical transcendent journey from start to finish. At it's core it's not really a horror film despite its disturbing imagery and scary undertones, it's more of a fairytale set in a nightmarish world filled which on the one hand features majestic creatures and then on the other its an all too serious examination of the horrors of the Civil War and that's what makes it so engaging and its something that sticks with you long after it's over.This manages to both terrifying and moving at the same time and that's a rare feat for any type of genre cinema and all that's down to the superb direction by Guillermo Del Toro whose created something really special and magical here and its definitely the best thing he's ever created. The special effects and monster designs are really something to behold here and are just magnificent and holds up incredibly well even by today's standards.The performances here are fantastic with each actor giving it their all in their roles and making this movie the spectacle that it is. Ivana Baquero gives an extremely effective performance as the young girl Ofelia. Sergio Lopez gives a compelling and well-rounded performance as the evil Captain Vidal and Doug Jones is utterly captivating as the Pale Man.Overall 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a unique masterpiece from start to finish and came as a breath of fresh air to the genre amongst all the remakes that cluttered the market at the time and brought new life into modern cinema."
aylakalan,"Nov 29, 2024",9/10,"El Laberinto del Fauno is a masterful fusion of fantasy and reality, a film that immerses you in a world as haunting as it is beautiful. Guillermo del Toro crafts a poignant tale where the magic of childhood imagination collides with the stark brutality of the real world, creating a story that feels both timeless and profoundly human.The film's visual splendor is unmatched, with its intricate creature designs and lush, atmospheric settings that transport you to a realm of wonder and unease. Del Toro's direction seamlessly intertwines the fantastical with the historical, crafting a narrative rich with symbolism and emotional depth.At its core, El Laberinto del Fauno is a story about resilience, courage, and the enduring power of hope in the face of darkness. It's a cinematic fairy tale for adults, as hauntingly beautiful as it is deeply moving-a true work of art that lingers in your heart long after the journey ends."

If you watch this movie prepare to have you breath taken away, and your heart pumping. The tension gets to levels where you almost can't take it anymore.

xzedmac,"Sep 28, 2017",9/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a truly gripping film. It shows the difference in class between the peasant resistance and the fascist military. It's a great blend of action and drama whilst managing to stay interesting to the audience. It combines history, fantasy, politics and a story into 2 hours of enthralling film. The setting is magical and transports you into a world of mystical delight.The costume and make up team really out do themselves, making the mythical creature of a Faun look real. It's not CGI or some animations; they took the time and effort to make a Greek god, only seen in paintings into a real life being.The Performance by Ivana Baquero is brilliant, especially as she was only 11 or 12 at the time. She has to act with CGI; she has to act scared, sad, happy, relieved and surprised. With such little experience puts on an incredible show. Also, the performance of Sergi Lopez is amazing. From the first time we meet him to the last he keeps his character, a character which is always by the book, cold hearted and emotionless, even towards a child.Before watching the film I expected a corny story with poor performance by the lead child actor. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Even though it's sounds all cheesy story, it's actually quite dark, brutal and thrilling. There's unexpected violence completely out of nowhere that surprises the audience and gives a true insight into what the character are like early on.Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is a must see block buster. Please do not discriminate it as it's foreign with subtitles, after a few minutes your used to it and hooked on its riveting tale."

Filled with apstract Creatures and unique Situations it had more substance than i thought.Parents may think this is a Movie Children could watch. It is not.The Setting of Franco´s Spain is a very interesting choice.I wasnt expecting this level of gruesome violence tho.Brutal and merciless Murder as well as Torture is shown here in unexpected detail.Entertaining Movie.

guskeller,"Dec 29, 2021",9/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful union of heart and craft. The writing stands out because it has several strong layers. The story is emotionally impactful, open to interpretation, original, thematic, and grounded yet fantastical. Meanwhile, the actors bring life to potent characters, and nail arcs that feel fresh yet deeply relatable. All in all, Pan's Labyrinth is a magical journey through childlike imagination, built around a tragic core. The script alone is sure to capture the hearts and minds of all viewers. However, the filmmaking perfectly elevates that sentimental drive and constructs a unique atmosphere, creating something truly special.The technicals of Pan's Labyrinth are purposeful and delicate, always enhancing its emotions. The cinematography subtly propels the film's themes through color schemes, composition, and framing. Scenes fluidly transition on matching camera movements, suggesting the relationship between imagination and reality. The sound design is surreal in supernatural scenes (heightening their magic) and stark in dramatic scenes (heightening their harshness). The music is mystical yet melancholy, flawlessly expressing the film's tone. Finally, the effects and production designs are visionary and make Pan's Labyrinth iconic. Indeed, this film is a passionate force and a thorough experience.Writing: 10/10

manicmeuk,"May 5, 2007",6/10,"i cant understand how this movie could have got the credit its achieved when its completely misleading.this is without a doubt NOT a fantasy movie. this movie is NOT as advertised as a dark exploration into fantasy, it is a very disjointed poor effort at attaining a level of creative genius that simply surpassed the skills of the director.don't get me wrong, i can fully appreciate the excellent acting in this movie. i have no qualms about the talent seen on screen.i am however struggling to understand how people can have reached such a level of dullness that they could see this movie and be astounded by its creative imagery.do we not read anymore? do we not draw? do we not dream. this film completely lacked any skill any creative talent that was abundant in other films such as the original labyrinth movie and dark crystal. what has happened to imagination? this film exploited computer technology and advanced special effects to add polish to what was simply an extremely dull and lacking story.perhaps what i found most displeasing about this movie, is its frankly insulting attitude to fantasy. this movie could have been done so well, and no this is not an attack on its Spanish origins. this movie simply splashes about special effects and crams in totally unneeded fantasy elements that simply do not fit. this film is NOT a fantasy, in fact the fantasy elements totalled to less than half an hour of the film and were so disjointed from the storyline that they completely failed to have any impact.i cant help but feel like this movie that is being defended simply because its foreign actually managed to sit itself with the rest of the commercial drivel that seems to be coming out of America. this in itself is not terrible, i can enjoy a shallow meaningless movie for what it is. this movie however tries and fails to attain a level of creativity and depth that it set itself out to have.really was so terribly disappointed with this movie. please please please do not confine your imagination to this absolute trash. only reason I'm giving it 4 is because the separate elements on their own have merit, but as a film, this was an absolute mess."
kavazuma,"May 28, 2007",1/10,"And I didn't expect what I got when I saw Pan's Labyrinth, either. Based on the marketing, the reviews, the previews, the buzz, etc., I was looking forward to a moving, visually rich mythopoetic tale that would feed my spirit and inspire my imagination. What I saw instead was a bloody, disgusting, depraved, amoral, aspiritual, nihilistic, and ultimately pointless horror film that fried my nervous system, left me furious, and made me fearful for any culture that embraces this sort of psychotic trash as art.I signed up with IMDb just now for the sole purpose of warning others like me away from this soul-abusive celebration of torture, blood lust, killing, and graphic ultraviolence. I'm so glad I didn't see this in a movie theater, as it would have been severely traumatizing. Thankfully, this nightmare was a rental DVD from the local video store and I'm headed out the door to return it as soon as this review is posted. I don't want this sadistic violation of my senses and my spirit in my home any longer than necessary.If you are a sensitive person with a kind heart, a vivid imagination, and a rich inner life, do yourself a favor and do NOT expose yourself to this psychotic splatterfest."
ejhov1,"Jun 28, 2015",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few films I call beautiful film. It has a great main character with complex emotions. The cinematography is beautiful and Guillermo del Toro's direction is great. All the acting is great and Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia the protagonist gives the best child performance of all time. Not only does she give one of the best child performance, but one of the best performances of all time. The creatures which is a staple in Guillermo's films are all practical effects which show the dedication to make a great film. This is one of my favorite films, so I recommend this film to everyone.

epactanat,"Mar 10, 2024",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a phenomenal but quite tragic fantasy movie that I would recommend to people if given the chance. While it's not strictly a horror film, there are quite a lot of disturbing elements some viewers may find unpleasant (Mostly gore.)It's a well written movie with amazing characters, the cinematography that deliver or the amazing acting from all the characters. While those are the main components that hold everything together I won't go into those as I want to focus on the settings and the creature design that are downright gorgeous in its own twisted way.For me, the most underrated aspect of this film is the settings. Not in its design but in it's presentation. Pan's Labyrinth is a dark but magical place located in a real world of 1940 Spain, which is quite refreshing compared to fantasy films during that time which usually take place in a different world altogether. There's the real world we are familiar with albeit filled with the terror of the ongoing war. Despite being the world we know, the film does a great job illustrating the cruelty of the world and human as a whole. On the other hand we have the Pan's Labyrinth, a mysterious place that connects the protagonist Ofelia with the magical world. While it's a dark and scary looking place inhabited by a strange creature called Faun, it's the safest place Ofelia can be at peace without having to worry about the cruel world she grew up with.Now to the main impressive part, the creature design. While the outfit of the soldiers are well made, the monsters in this film are the highlight for me. First the Faun, a mysterious goat/human/tree hybrids who aided Ofelia in her quest. Sergio Sandoval take on the mythical creature Faun was quite different compared to the usual, like the one in Narnia. There's some sense of creepiness and friendliness to it, making the watcher question their actual nature as a character. Next is the paleman, a horrifying monster that made a short yet memorable appearance. It's creepy and cruel and act as a parallel to the actual main antagonist of the movie, Captain Vidal. But the costumes alone can't bring them to life, that's where Doug Jones' acting come in. He did an amazing job mimicking the strange movement of the creature making them seems less human.Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is an emotional dark fantasy movie that shows us the cruelty of humankind and escapism through the eyes of a young girl. There are more to it than this review as I want everyone reading this to experience it as blind as possible."
mufaronashe,"Oct 9, 2024",10/10,"I remember first watching Pan's Labyrinth as a teenager and being absolutely enthralled by it! The film's hauntingly beautiful visuals and poignant storytelling captivated me from the very beginning. By the end, I was brought to tears, overwhelmed by its emotional depth and the stark contrast between the harsh realities of war and the enchanting, yet dark, fantasy world. It's one of those films that lingers in your mind and heart for years on end. A true cinematic masterpiece that transcends time, it's a must-see before you die! If you haven't experienced this breathtaking film yet, I implore you to watch it immediately!"
AnthonyH-292,"Oct 22, 2025",9/10,My initial reaction was that it was fun and how it came full circle was amazing.one memorable moment I remember was went the demon ask for the little girl brother and she though about but then said no to him. I dont think is a coming of age film. I feel like this was all in her head and she was dreaming all of thing that was happening. One motif I remember was the one when the girl took the baby from the man and in the background it look like the sunrise but it was just the fires of the battle they just had.
searchanddestroy-1,"Apr 10, 2023",N/A,"If you are reluctant to fantasy and fairy tales but instead crave for rational topics, as I am, maybe this film is not for you. It was difficult for myself to prepare the viewing, knowing in advance what it was about. But it is well done, the director Guillermo del Torro a very talented film maker, showing us a real awesome movie. And, I repeat, I usually don't like this kind of films, not my cup of tea. For once, I really tried and was finally rewarded. This is riveting on many points and the Sergi Lopez's performance is terrific, unique, so different from what he usually made, in a disgusting character. But beware, this is not WIZARD OF OZ. This is not destined to young audiences, despite the presence of a young female lead character. This is gloomy, dark, but also splendid piece of work. Outstanding production design. Sad fantasy tale."
jzappa,"Jan 21, 2007",7/10,"I haven't liked a single Guillermo Del Toro film that I've seen. I didn't like Mimic, Blade II, or Hellboy. That's not all he's made, but that's three strikes. I felt like that would be the last of the Guillermo Del Toro films that I'd see, until Pan's Labyrinth comes along and gets tremendous praise. I thought, well it actually looks good, and I'm sure every director, even the lesser ones, has his day, and so I decided to see it. I saw it, and I was disappointed.The movie has atmosphere, which I always like. I like how the film never leaves the Spanish cabin and the woods that surround it. And I also enjoyed the magical creatures, the good ones and the bad ones, when they were actually shown. The problem with the movie is that it's so uneven that you come in not really fully knowing what to expect and then somehow leave with the feeling that you haven't gotten what you expected.The film takes place during the Spanish Revolution, and attempts to center around one little girl's adventure into a world of fairies, gods, and heavenly creatures, the Revolution being the antagonist that may keep her from reaching the etherial life as the princess of this world. This is hardly effective because the movie is 80% Revolution and 20% fantasy. The audience is subjected to waiting through scenes, even violent and action-packed ones, instead of enjoying them. This is not because these scenes are badly done or boring, but because we didn't come to see a movie about the Spanish Revolution and the evil of the little girl's warlord father. We came to see a fantasy. The scenes of fantasy are very enjoyable, but in all, they probably add up to about a half hour. The remaining hour and a half is lost focus.Pan's Labyrinth is uneven in many other ways, too. For instance, it's a fantasy about a little girl, but it's rated R. The film is advertised like any other fantasy film, much less a fantasy film about a little girl, and there's nothing R-rated about it. So when we see that R rating, what are we to expect? Right up until the second I sat down in the theater, I had no idea what I was seeing. All I knew was that it was called Pan's Labyrinth. And it's because the movie doesn't know what it is, what it's about, or who it's about. Is it a fantasy about a little girl, or is it a drama, or is it both, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about a fantasy world, or is it about the Spanish Revolution, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about the little girl or is it about her father?Maribel Verdu's performance is terrific, as is that of Sergi Lopez, Ivana Boquero, and Ariadna Gil, and the cinematography is beautiful, capturing the atmosphere I speak of, but they hardly effect one who is watching a completely unfocused story. I think that's the end of the line for Guillermo Del Toro in my book. I gave him one more big chance after three strikes, and he still couldn't quite cut it. Benicio Del Toro is a fine actor, but his brother should maybe work for a publishing company or something."
Tweetienator,"Feb 6, 2018",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few movies I rate with a straight ten: a fantastic and unusual story, an outstanding cast (Ivana Baquero is incredible good as Ofelia), a superb cinematography and directing - simply put, a movie without any flaw. Everything composed like a well-balanced opera or a play by Shakespeare.Guillermo del Toro did with this movie one of the finest moments in movie history. Pan's Labyrinth belongs to me in the same league as movies like Metropolis, Apocalypse Now, Godfather etc.A must-see. Especially for every lover of the unusual, fantastic and strange."
cdoelle,"Feb 19, 2007",6/10,"Pan's Labyrinth was a total shocker. From the previews, I was expecting a fairy tale. I literally thought I was in for fairies, goblins, and all manner of fantastical creatures. Sure, there was some of that in PL... but this is no kids film.I was blown away by the sheer violence and gore. Don't get me wrong, I love a good bloodbath film, but this just seemed a bit too gratuitous. The story itself was okay, but in reality it was just a retelling of an old theme with added gore.One of the reasons I watch films is to be surprised... to not know what to expect... to have a film lead me somewhere as I follow engrossed in it all. The only thing that wasn't standard ""I know what comes next"" fare were the occasional bouts of violence. I have seen both storytelling and violence handled much better."
DaffodilLittley,"Mar 13, 2021",10/10,"I have no words how brilliant is this movie. Watch it once and never forget it. Especially how it made you feel. Perfect acting, story, music and visuals."
kevin_robbins,"Dec 9, 2021",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline takes place in the 1940s Spain where a revolution is taking place and a brutal military captain, his family and his battalion take up in a farmhouse of the people he's fighting against. His family includes his new son and his wife's daughter that isn't his child. The farm house has a mysterious Labyrinth behind it that one day draws the little girl in using fairies and a faun. They give her a chance to meet her father and save her family from the Captain but she'll need to follow the faun's instructions to perfection or risk losing her opportunity.This movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy I & II) and stars Ivana Baquero (Black Friday), Ariadna Gil (Nuts for Love), Sergi López (Dirty Pretty Thing), Maribel Verdú (Y tu mamá también) and Doug Jones (The Shape of Water).Every single aspect of this movie is perfect. The settings and circumstances are perfectly setup. The magical and mythical aspects are beautiful. The horror elements are intense and extremely well done. The military scenes are brilliantly depicted as well as the challenges of the time. There's so much gore in this it surprised me rewatching it and the conclusion comes out of nowhere and is perfect.This film will always be an underrated masterpiece that's up there with the greatest films all time. This is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10."
Zvargo,"May 1, 2016",9/10,"(SPOILERS) Pan's Labyrinth blew me away. Set during a Spanish Civil War, the setting often alternated between the horrors of reality and the fanciful wonderland that the young girl Ofelia, played by Ivana Baquero found herself in. After an encounter with a bipedal talking Faun played by Doug Jones who tells her she must complete 3 tasks before the next full moon in order to escape the mortal land and live with her father and mother who are royalty of the underworld. Each of these three tasks require Ofelia to venture away from her pregnant and sickly mother, played by Ariadna Gil and brutal step-father played by Sergi López to complete these tasks she receives from a magic book that the faun had given her.This movie was beautiful. Beautiful in the darkest of ways that I think I have seen put to film. A housemaid named Mercedes who essentially takes Ofelia under her wing has a lullaby that she hums to Ofelia at one point of the film. It is so simple and beautiful but very important to the film as you can hear it and its influence throughout the score of the film. The color pallet of the film is incredibly dark yet beautiful. The reality of the civil war ravaged area of Spain is constantly overcast and dark or rainy and each of the fantastical elements of the film are presented in the same type of light except I noticed that with each task Ofelia had to complete the composition of the shots became darker and darker as her situations became more and more dire. This darkness continues until the incredibly bright, bittersweet climax of the film. Innocence of person seems to be the central theme of this movie. Ofelia is thrust into a world she wanted nothing to do with. Her mother becomes pregnant and moves to the compound where the Captain Vidal and the men he commands over reside. He is a terrible, brutal man. Vidal is perhaps one of the most brutal and frightening antagonists I have ever seen in a film. He treats Ofelia and her mother like objects while only caring about his son (the baby that the mother Carmen is pregnant with). He takes no prisoners except to torture and maim them before killing them when he receives what he wants. Ofelia stands to be the central figure of innocence throughout a war where both sides are killing each other or backstabbing each other. Ofelia's innocence is brought to light in many instances throughout the film until the climax when the Faun requires the blood of an Innocent to open a portal back to Ofelia's true royal family.This movie was very different than your standard ""Innocence triumphs"" type film. No one is sacred or untouchable in this movie and it shows throughout. While a movie such as E.T. has a bitter sweet ending and the innocent child risks his life to save another certainly could be paid tribute here in Pan's Labyrinth, I feel it is taken to an extreme showing the horrors of experiencing a war as a child from the frontlines. Motifs in which Ofelia's innocence are tested throughout the film. There are moments when her character traits put those around her in danger because she didn't consider her acts to be ""That bad"" and in the ultimate test of innocence she sacrificed herself for her brother ultimately earning her way from her mortal body to reclaim her spot as princess in the underworld with her mother and father. This film truly shows a strong innocent character in Ofelia. She was brave until the end and while the film seemed to leave the ending up to the viewer I like to believe that it was truly a bittersweet ending when the credits rolled. A dark and twisted fairy tale, Pan's Labyrinth was great and highly recommended."
fernandoschiavi,"Dec 26, 2021",8/10,"The film opens with dreamlike images where the voiceover of a narrator is heard, as if we were all the time watching a fable unfold before us. Many aesthetic-narrative aspects are important in Pan's Labyrinth: the two worlds, the real and the imaginary, are well demarcated in the film with very specific dramatic intensities. The Real World is marked by strong scenes of violence with the right to torture, sadism, hemorrhages, torn jaws and subsequently sewn together and many gunshots. The Imaginary World lived by Ophelia is marked by very intense discoveries that begin to happen when she enters the Labyrinth of the Faun, guided by a mysterious insect. Her encounter with Fauno and her fantastic characterization recalls many encounters in Fairy Tales such as Beauty and the Beast and Little Red Riding Hood with the Wolf, all with an implicit erotic content. The transformation of a repellent praying mantis into a fairy is reminiscent of Wendy's encounter with Peter Pan's Fairy Tinkerbell, not to mention the more direct and referent readings such as Alice in Wonderland and The Thousand and One Nights, with the references contained in the words of the Faun who claims that Ophelia is a Princess of the Underground World.The upward curve of Ophelia's symbolic challenges into the unknown, which no adult shares, has real counterpoints. It is similar to the fragility of your mother's health condition, which is constantly intensifying. At the same time, her ritualistic trajectory follows a movement parallel to the intensification of combat between the military and the rebels, who are trying to defeat the forces of the authoritarian government eager for power in Spain. Ophelia must complete magical missions to save herself from the violent reality that surrounds her. In the midst of these tests, she has a disgusting encounter with a gigantic frog and, with a magic chalk, enters a world inhabited by a surrealistic monster with sharp nails and eyes in her hands, which provides the viewer with one of the most original sequences in the history of Fantastic cinema, with impressive composition and finishing. The work of photography director Guillermo Navarro in Pan's Labyrinth is exquisite. He manages to create textures and chromatic tensions varied and perfectly placed in each situation in the film, whether in a dinner scene, in a scene of extreme horror and torture, or in a purely surreal scene, he creates atmospheres that often come close of the virtuosity of Baroque Painting.Del Toro's beautiful script exceptionally aligns these three nuclei, transforming them into a single narrative block that constantly alternates reality and fantasy, leaving the final reading of what really happened with Ophelia to the spectator. That is, it is the public's task to understand if she really came into contact with the fantastic, arising from the mythical nature unattainable by adults, or if her entire story was not the result of her own imagination, in a psychic tactic of denial and self-defense against family tragedy that befell his life. The structure of The Labyrinth of the Faun follows in the footsteps of traditional fairy tales, but rescues the violent and primitive essence of its original versions, written by names like Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers and which Hollywood eliminated in its properly sanitized productions. Ophelia plays with this fact when she receives the first visit of a fairy, whose insect form is not very reminiscent of the figure in her children's storybook. The art direction builds the entire dark and swampy atmosphere of the film, displaying all the effluvia and emanations of an ancestral nature, prior to the political and social reality in which the film is based.The work is so far from what fairy tales have become that the kindest beings do not necessarily introduce themselves to Ophelia in a friendly way. The faun himself, a hybrid of man, tree and goat, is gesturally much rougher and more irascible than might be expected. Upon failing in her second task, the girl receives a rather fierce reprimand from her messenger to the underworld. The creature exhibits the rusticity of a true herald of nature, which puts Ophelia in contact with the ancestry that the feature film rescues as the central point of the story. The excellent mime actor Doug Jones plays both Guillermo del Toro's faun and the terrifying Pale Man, which guarantees one of the film's most harrowing passages. His bodywork is careful in every detail, ranging from the exotic posture and gait of his characters to the heteroclic way in which the Pale Man grope around him, looking for his own eyes, which he grotesquely inserts into the palms of his hands.Cleverly, Del Toro transports his argument to the field. Surrounded by forests, the public is comfortable in accepting that there may be a mythical universe out there. Surrounding this universe are the hard fences of the real world, a characteristic that also marks the work of other fantastic directors, such as Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam. The only different ingredient in Del Toro's film is the surrealist touches inherited from Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, another who used his work to criticize the fascists. This dreamlike and gothic universe is the backbone of the film. Del Toro does not delimit what is fantasy or reality. He points out paths and lets the public embark on the trip of their choice. Even in the conclusion, Del Toro contrasts the two worlds. The viewer is able to choose based on their personal beliefs. Anyone who does not believe in fairies, legends and mythology will not feel cheated. Optimists who still see hope in the chaotic world we live in will be pleased. And this duality is evident in Ofelia's personality. It shows that perhaps the best way to escape reality is to create a fantasy world.Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro presents a dark fable filled with metaphors and allegories. In addition to being pure entertainment, the film is also a great mental meal for moviegoers and lovers of fantastic literature. It's easy to find references to movies like The Shining, The Legend of the Headless Knight, The Wizard of Oz, Hellboy (by Del Toro himself) and books like Alice in Wonderland and the aforementioned fables by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. In Del Toro's script, the difference between Ofelia's world and Vidal's is evident. She believes in dreams and fantasy, feelings and vital characteristics for human development. Vidal is a product of a rigid and fascist world. His ideology is based on violence. Del Toro takes the opportunity to analyze psychologically how men of this nature are the result of an aggressive and abusive relationship between their parents. But the debate is not just social, but also political. Vidal fails to see the rebels as a threat. For him, it's a matter of time for everyone to be eliminated. In The Devil's Spine (2001), Del Toro had already used children to present political themes as a backdrop - the same Spanish Civil War. The two films complete each other in meaning. And Del Toro's message is not about the loss of innocence, but about how we have to embrace it in order to survive emotionally.The actors are other important figures for the development of the story, especially Ivana Baquero, the young woman who plays Ophelia. At just twelve years old, Ivana has demonstrated that she possesses more depth than many more experienced actresses. Just the girl's gaze reminds us of something mysterious and melancholy. Practically every scene in the film counts with the presence of Baquero, who did not disappoint at any time. Ariadna Gil, responsible for playing the character Carmen, mother of the protagonist, is another one that deserves to be highlighted. She captured the essence of her role, bringing her pains, apparently forgotten, as she really tried, after the death of Ophelia's father, to continue life with another man, even if she didn't come to love him. Sergi López, Captain Vidal, is another who, in a strong and sure way, emphasizes his character, helping him to be rejected by spectators.In this work, fantasy and reality end up intertwining in such a way that there comes a certain moment in history when we no longer know if what is happening is happening in the real or fantastic planes. And as the end of the film is open, it is up to the viewer to choose between one or the other, or even both. But those who think that the film is childish are wrong: when Vidal, the captain, is described as ""sadistic"" it is because he is, and some scenes involving the battle between the military and the rebels are quite violent and graphic. On the other hand, the film balances violence with the lightness provided by Ofelia's arc and her exploration into the fantastic world.In short, Pan's Labyrinth is a charming film, both visually, for the good use of effects and makeup, and for its narrative, which has won us over since the beginning. Labyrinth of the Fauno is not a film for children, but for adults - let that be made clear! In his well-dosed mix of horror, fantasy, historical drama, the director has created a work that can be enjoyed by both the most ardent and demanding fans of the Fantastic Cinema, for those who enjoy bloody and artistically well-crafted scenes, and also by connoisseurs of the so-called Cinema of European Art. Del Toro has created a film of many intensities of emotion, wonder and horror that won't leave any viewer indifferent after watching ecstatic the end credits soar across the cinema screen as the powerful images of the film seethe in his head.With the courage to tackle a scathing children's drama with a political background and archetypal traits, free from any corny traces or empty sentimentality, and adorning the film with high doses of analytical psychology, symbolic imagination and visual effects that enhance the fantastic content of the work, Del Toro presents in this work one of his best productions."

There are not many CGI elements in this film, and so its real, practical creativity communicates to its audience, directly. The film does not date."
ayamit-7,"Oct 27, 2025",N/A,"The overall movie was great. It was well explained and well played out. It was like a fairy tale who had kings , queens , princess , and a villain who was the general. It tells a story that if you do good and complete the hard challenges in life you can go somewhere special. Meaning that when Opeilia had completed those hard quest and was at the last one who had to sacrifice a innocent person she picked herself and let the baby live. When she pick the correct option she was sent to heaven where her father and mother is it and came back to be the princess."
imdb-19548,"Dec 25, 2007",6/10,"This interweaves a dark children's fairytale with an simple adult war story and the effect does leave you wondering why bother merging them? The cynical answer is that neither story is good enough or substantial enough to stand on it's own!The stories are both quite simple with very little dialogue.The fairytale is a very old-fashioned story of a lost fairy princess trying to regain her throne and is done well although I had heard before watching it that it was visually stunning and was a little disappointed that it isn't, it is visually interesting but certainly not stunning.The war story is also nothing new, a vicious soldier trying to hunt down the rebels while there are spies in his camp.The only original thing in the film is the mixing of the two stories and this is done very well with dark scenes in reality being played on top of dark fantasy scenes and the mounting desperation of Ofelia to escape her life.The acting is good with Baquero causing none of the annoyances that often occur when children star in adult films, the rest of the cast deliver good performances keeping you interested and giving some depth to the war story.The ending is surprising and consistent although with a little compromise to the dark theme of the rest of the film.The problem is that the film is insubstantial, neither story line is memorable on it's own and joining them doesn't do enough to raise the film above the level of a curiosity. Worth seeing but nothing to get excited about."
jvincent1,"Jun 23, 2007",6/10,"Given the present sorry state of American cinema, I was somewhat cynical of a film as heralded as this one. After all, what had Guillermo del Toro done to enhance his reputation as a filmmaker other than Blade II, and Hellboy? I've seen better resumes from young directors. So, what do we get from him in Pan's Labrynth? A magical war movie set during the revolt against Spain's Generalisimo Franco. Guys, I'm still waiting for the day when CGI becomes so good that it can replace the need for a good story. That del Toro is a product of the CGI-dominated school of film-making is very evident here, as the truly wondrous special effects taking place below the earth seemingly have little to do with the world above. There, the evil Captain brutalizes, tortures and kills peasants by the dozens, and we get to watch every excruciating minute of it. I even wanted to cheer when he finally ""got"" his in the end; one shot to the head. And, how does the magical world below help bring about the demise of the captain? Oh, it doesn't. This fantastic world of visual horrors but mostly delights, is strictly for the benefit of poor little Ofelia (and, surprise, surprise, there's her mother, another victim of the captain). The inhabitants of this netherworld enable us to appreciate the value of old time effects such as make-up, but it's still effects, effects, effects. Except for topside, where its murder, torture, more murder (we even get to see the captain perform a little stitch job on the side of his mouth). The more I write, the worse this movie gets, so I'll end it here by saying if you want to see a filmmaker combine plot with imaginative special effects feast your eyes on a Terry Gilliam film, particularly his Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. If only he could reign it in just a little."

If you have never watched this film you must do so, but don't be fooled... it is far from a child's fantasy fairy tale... quite bloody and graphic at times. I would not watch it with anyone of school age....having said that, for adults, this is a masterpiece..."
ramesestsarina2,"Jul 3, 2014",9/10,"This film is truly brilliant. I could spend this entire review gushing about how wonderful I think it is, but will try to be more precise.The plot is beautifully constructed, juxtaposing seamlessly between a reality without hope and the fantasy that offers a light at the end of the tunnel. The acting was superb throughout – the young Ivana Baquero shows remarkable skill in bringing the character of Ofelia to life, and we really can believe and enter into her distress and fear. The haunting music was a perfect backdrop to the action, enhancing the despair of the situation. The effects are excellent and believable.Whether or not the audience is supposed to believe that Ofelia is imagining things or whether it is really happening, seems to me to be ultimately irrelevant. What the audience is looking at is the idea of hope rising out of despair, in the person of a little girl who believes in magic. The effect she has on the adults around her, whether it be contempt from the Captain, or the love she inspires in Mercedes, is the most poignant and beautiful part of this story.This is a great movie. I can't recommend it too highly."
mogstar97,"Jul 4, 2014",10/10,"Guillermo del Toro has crafted a masterpiece, a brutal, terrifying fairytale for adults who watch in anticipation as the events in the film unfold. The lead features a strong, adventurous child named Ofelia who discovers a Faun and that a fairytale world. It is everything she dreamt of.This remarkable film spins a tale about a little girl trapped between a dream world of ghouls and real-life monsters during the Spanish Civil War, and it works remarkably well, simultaneously enchanting and horrifying with almost every frame. It's dark and horrifying appealing to an older audience yet shows the hardships of that time.The actors are all stable in their roles and Doug Jones as the El Fauno is stunning. The costumes are something else that entice me, especially El Fauno who looks as though he is part of the Earth from which he probably came. There are roughly 2 plot lines running in parallel; the military-resistance story and the princess fantasy story. Both move back and forth as needed. Each storyline connects smoothly and is easy for the audience to follow."

The makeup and costumes were superb. I've watched this movie many times, it's one you'll never forget.A little girl can see things that others can't and it makes more sense as to why as you continue to watch the movie. The ending was also phenomenal because it made you think. I was both sad and happy at the same time.My only gripe is that they refuse to Sub this in English, which is a bit ableist.

Schopenhauer101,"Jul 3, 2007",7/10,"This movie was an interesting experience. The camera-work is gorgeous, the effects very nice, good acting too. I mean it. But the movie has some REALLY serious flaws too, no question about it. A movie about fantasy in a way misses its point when it makes you think of computer animations and latex puppets. The story has to be grounded in primarily in the viewers *emotions* not in the senses that reaches ear and eye. In the first Star Wars movies the effects was great at the time but it was the saga, the tale that made one keep thinking about it for weeks after leaving the cinema. That wont happen with this film even if it is quite good. Visuals cant alone create that, and it shouldn't, a audience that confuse surface with deep, lay ground to an empty shallow and scary cultural scenario.Also and more importantly...the intensity of the depicted violence can never replace the overall intensity of the movie experience. I think everybody somewhere know that that is a very very cheap trick. Still the monkey in man begin to clap hands when seeing the violence in sin city or 300, just for the sake of violence. The problem with the visual torture in this movie was that it felt so unnecessary. Sometimes violence can improve a movie, like in Shindlers list, (but if that movie had been a gore-movie like ""Passion of the Christ"", it would have teased our disgust more than our hearts. The jackass guys can disgust us, but they cant touch our deeper feelings because that takes intelligence and very hard artistic work.) Maybe the whole point with the gore in this film was to make people like me complain about it. Of course it will work, the day it wont, the world will be even worse than now. I know people that has been tortured in war, and don't find the idea of people watch the fiction of that as nice entertainment while eating popcorn very inspiring, or even as a good cultural sign. It should be easy to make the tale more adult without just adding violence, i mean, why not more complexity or depth instead? The movie was a good one anyway, but it could have been a true masterpiece if it had touched us even deeper with its storyline. See it yourself and get your own opinion.I rate it 6.5 of 10."
kenjha,"Jan 7, 2010",5/10,"This fairy tale with parallels to ""Alice in Wonderland"" has a little girl encountering bizarre characters in an alternate universe. The cinematography is quite impressive and del Toro displays a fine visual flair. However, the script is too random and contrived to be interesting and the characters are one-dimensional. The captain, for example, is pure evil, lacking a single redeeming character; his wife is a whiny weakling. The film intersperses the fairy tale with the account of the fascist army fighting insurgents, but the two threads don't complement each other. It's like watching two movies. del Toro's obsession with stomach-churning violence doesn't help matters."
ssssgelojun,"Jul 13, 2020",9/10,"The film is composed of myth and reality. The myth is about an underground princess returning to her kingdom. The reality is the story of the fascist general Vader's defeat of the guerrillas. The princess of the underground kingdom is Vader's stepdaughter Ophelia. The myth and reality of the film are always intertwined, which is a complete metaphor and reflection on the Spanish Civil War.Have a plot, it is - why Carmen, also is the girl's mother, at the table being laughed at, because she was asked how met captain, she said, she is the second time and captain met together, when is the first time in his husband's shop, with the housekeeper by ofelia Mercedes talks for the first time we learned that her father died, what is the battlefield?Civil war battlefields.So Ofelia's father was killed by her stepfather's faction. How ironic.Therefore, Ofelia has her own fantasy world, which can be understood as she wants to escape from the reality, the dictatorship of her stepfather and the political ideas that run counter to his. However, most of her fantasy world is as cruel as the reality, until her death brings liberation and freedom."
gauravsharmam,"Jun 1, 2020",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is the best work of writer-director Guillermo del Toro so far, and one of the finest film world have ever created. Every single piece of art is masterpiece and the best thing about this movie is Guillermo's taste of story and direction. I'm the guy who watched his 'The Shape of Water ' before watching 'Pan's Labyrinth ' both movies are mind blowing.Pan's Labyrinth is the most darkest fairytale-fantasy movie I've ever seen ,just like 'The Shape of Water ' Guillermo have used his story which contains meanings and lessons at eternity depth( harms of hatered, selfishness, irresponsibility, racism and irrational use of eternal power and benefits of kindness, innocence and courage) .Ofelia a very pretty and sweet girl travels with her pregnant mother to live with his cruel stepfather who is the captain of Spanish army. Her mind and soul are full of fairytales and fairies as she believe she'll find one day. A day comes when she follow a fairy to the labyrinth and get to a faun who tells Ofelia her true identity of being a princess but she has to succeed all three tasks allotted to her to prove her loyalty and royalty. Ofelia begins her journey fighting the demons of her dream world along the cruel demons of the real world where she has to protect her mother too. Her stepfather (as mentioned in the movie) kills each of the rebels in woods very beastly because he thinks them waste of society and wants her son to be born in a clean society. His portrayal is very cruel and arrogant who is no less than a beast.Guillermo del Toro have used several characters to describe several nature of the society and that makes this movie a must watch, it's an innocent treatment given very brutally, full of violence and hatred . There's a confusion with the story that, whether Ofelia's world is real or just an imagination of hers that is the most important and interesting part of this movie. It doesn't matter if her world is real or an imagination, her story ends up where it belonged she leaves the cruel world and become a princess just like she wanted to succeeding all three individual tasks and the evils end up the same way they deserved.Apart from these pluses, cinematography,perfect art work and brilliant production design are the other perfect things about this movie it is visually gorgeous movie and a masterstroke from Guillermo del Toro's directing chair .If you want to watch an extraordinary movie directed by the director of movies like Hellboy, The Shape of Water and Crimson Peak Guillermo del Toro then don't waste time watch it once , best of an era 'Pan's Labyrinth ' ."
jorgedzib,"Mar 2, 2017",8/10,"Guillermo of the bull did an excellent work with this movie, the makeup, the effects, the history, everything completely is a masterpiece, besides the fact that it makes you think if the history really is happening or everything happens only inside the head of the protagonist, plays so well with the perspective of the life and the infantile imagination that believes a history of completely new and darker fantasy as for tone, any fact for the excellent Mexican director."
lachezarmatneshliev,"Mar 26, 2025",9/10,"A brilliant work of the imagination capable of truly seizing and igniting our fantasies. A beautiful movie yes indeed haunting mixture of horror, history and fantasy that works simultaneously on every level. Pan's Labyrinth a mix of horror, fantasy, and history that convinces on all those levels and mixes them up with dizzying brio, is a searing cinematic experience, a beautiful, terrifying vision from writer-director Guillermo del Toro. Literally and figuratively marvelous, a rich, daring mix of fantasy and politics. This is a true fairy tale, and one of the finest fantasy pictures ever made. Suspended between the brutally graphic and flights of lyrical fancy, Pan's Labyrinth unfolds with the confidence of a classical fable, one that paradoxically feels both timeless and startlingly new."
dontcallmedudeplease,"May 9, 2018",9/10,"Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite directors and he spun together history, politics and fantasy so seamlessly I was left in awe. I originally didn't want to watch this movie because of the subtitles but I was drawn in so completely to the plot and the characters that within mere minutes I didn't notice. The movie is brilliantly layered with plot, content, history, politics, brutality, fantasy and metaphors. A young girl finds an escape from her abysmal existence and I was mesmerized from beginning to end. Must watch."
bm-25,"May 21, 2007",6/10,"Yes, UK critic Mark Kermode went overboard about it, but his is one voice. (And he was wrong about the Borat movie, too, as far as I was concerned.)Firstly, this is a very well made film, of that there's little doubt. Both the reality and fantasy elements are technically faultless. But as my wife and I were left puzzling after watching this film, ""Why?""If you separated the Reality element from the Fantasy you'd be left with two stories, one about a young girl and her troubles with a masochistic stepfather who is struggling with his father relationship (or lack of it) and is fixated on the production of a son. This is told well, if simplistically, and in excessively brutal detail. (Scenes of torture, disfigurement and other graphic violence.) Running concurrently with this is the same girl's introduction to her role as a Princess in the Fantasy world.What was the connection between them? I couldn't see it. All other aspects of the storytelling were unsophisticated, (the role of the partisans and insiders, the inevitable breaking of the rules in the girl's fantasy ""test""), so the likelihood of some deep and subtle meaning seems unlikely.So you can have half an OK tale about the end of the Spanish Civil War, and half an OK fantasy tale. Intertwined, for no obvious reason. (But very well made, oh yes, I mentioned that already!)"

Kassi-5,"Feb 19, 2008",6/10,"Very disappointing. I went into this movie prepared to see a fantasy, not a violent war movie. Someone told me that it would rip my heart out in a good way. There was no heart ripping. Basically zero emotions were provoked. I have no clue why so many people love this movie so much and were effected by it to the degree that they described. The fairytale aspects of this movie were old, recycled ideas that I've heard so many times that it even came across as trite to me. The movie wasn't gripping in any way besides the fact that I kept waiting for that famed ""heart rip"" that would happen that never delivered. Another thing that I didn't like was the portrayal of Pan. I thought for the amount of money that went into imagery, they could have done a better job with that character.6/10 for music, imagery,and the child actress, who was a remarkable actress and I'm looking forward to seeing her play in more roles, if that's where life takes her."

israphel-53548,"Mar 16, 2017",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a dark, enchanting and charming film set in Spain during a civil war. There are moments of terror in this not for kids flick. The practical effects in this film are top notch. The monsters are visually amazing and serve their purpose. There is a certain scene with a monster that really just makes you shiver. The acting, dialogue and plot are all great. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this work of art. Recommended to anyone above the age of 15."
dyanacazacu,"Feb 19, 2025",10/10,"Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is a rare film that blends fantasy and harsh reality in a way that feels both magical and deeply tragic. Set in post-Civil War Spain, the story follows Ofelia, a young girl who escapes into a mysterious, mythical world while the brutal rule of her stepfather, Captain Vidal, unfolds around her.The film is visually stunning, filled with breathtaking imagery and hauntingly beautiful set pieces. From the eerie faun who guides Ofelia to the nightmarish Pale Man, every creature feels like it belongs in an old, forgotten fairy tale-one that is far darker than the ones we're used to. The practical effects and CGI blend seamlessly, creating a world that is both believable and surreal.At its core, Pan's Labyrinth is a story about innocence and resistance in the face of cruelty. Ivana Baquero gives a heartfelt performance as Ofelia, perfectly capturing a child's wonder and determination. Sergi López is terrifying as Captain Vidal, embodying cold, ruthless authority. The contrast between his brutality and Ofelia's escapism is what makes the film so powerful.The story is both heartbreaking and mesmerizing, leaving you with a sense of wonder and sadness long after the credits roll. Del Toro masterfully weaves fantasy and history together, making Pan's Labyrinth not just a fairy tale, but a meditation on war, sacrifice, and the power of imagination.It's a film that stays with you, haunting and beautiful in equal measure."
innovatewinvivek,"Jan 31, 2019",10/10,"I am out of words to describe the scale of this movie.
A movie that comes out of the Heart, Mind and Soul of a true creator.
This is a movie, The Director - ""Guillermo del Toro"", has truly felt for atleast a 100 years in his own imagination, before making it in HOLLYWOOD.This movie is ICONIC for a Monster-picture."

I was so confused when watching the movie.If I mention it as Masterpiece, it will not be finished and will stay a lot of things untold. Really a brilliant work and I am so amazed. A movie which deserves a lot of things. It has no need to get the Awards, the special award is love and enjoying the every moment with innocent bird.Best wishes, love and pray for the story maker, movie director and actor. :)"
RResende,"Dec 25, 2007",N/A,"This was an ambitious project. The director was really aiming at producing something remarkable. And it does have beautiful moments, filled with intensity and visual poetry, something which warms a viewer but it is not immediately synonym to good cinema. Direct to it, i didn't really like this film, despite the overwhelming good reviews and sympathy of the audience. The narrative structure is clear and simple: we have a story that goes on in a ""real"" historical time, and we have another line which is ""magical"" and runs (maybe) in the head and vision of a little girl. The first thread should represent the cruelness and violence of the real world, right in the middle of a brutal war context; the second thread is the escape for those who are able to ""see"" magic, here impersonated by our little girl. She reads books, lots of them, story books, and those stories leak into the world she creates, representing this in fact the leaking del Toro intentionally wanted to make, crossing his own references and creating a magical world which is in fact a mist of several ""children"" stories. Well, the problem is here, to my view. Fernando Pessoa stated the paradox that a children's story should never be written for children. He meant that it should give juice to the minds of adult thinking as well. So, good children stories always include paradoxes, ambiguities and difficult decisions, remember Alice, remember Andersen, remember the Grimm, remember Sophia Mello Breyner... A good children's story, magical or not, is most of the times a synthesis of complex principles that exist in a grey world, beyond black and white. Well, here everything is black or white. You know, from beginning to the end what is good and what is bad, even the ""flaw"" of our little girl comes from disobeying, not through temptation. And this is a poor vision, to me, one that doesn't live up to the way all this was executed. Because there are very very strong moments here. The fantasy characters are really engaging, the Fauno is really engaging, the way its evolution is made as the film moves along, the character with eyes in his hands is a fantastic character, all that scene is brilliantly executed. And some references are really tender. The performances are good as well. But something just doesn't go well here, and that is what i mentioned. It's as if the winner of the war in the film was the captain, and who made this film thinks one sided, good-bad, by extremes, the way he would have taught his children... spooky.My opinion: 2/5 this will be a good visual experience, if you can forget the weaknesses i pointed out. i couldn't"
ctomvelu1,"Sep 14, 2009",6/10,"Do not let the title fool you: this Spanish import is not a traditional fantasy like LABRYNTH, WILLOW or LEGEND. Instead, it is a dark and extremely unpleasant look back at war-ravaged Spain in the 1940s. The young daughter of a brutish army officer begins to imagine herself in a dark realm, in order to escape real life. In her fantasy, she has to achieve a certain number of goals to be crowned queen of this bizarre realm. Meanwhile, the war rages on and her father kills virtually everyone in sight, sometimes sadistically. PAN has overtones of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, if Alice were on acid. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, but it is pretty easy to follow. The CGI is mind-boggling, but the story is so death-obsessed, it doesn't really matter in the end. PAN is a nihilistic effort that goes much too far to present the horrors of war and the savagery of men. Approach with extreme caution, and no child under 13 should view this. It may be considered a masterpiece by the art-house crowd, but it is not a mainstream film."
bryanbph-82636,"Sep 17, 2017",9/10,"I remember my interest in seeing this when it first came out in 2006, so I went to the big screen and saw it there and remember being blown away about how amazing this movie was. I was a bit skeptical paying for a movie that wasn't in English, and having to spend the entire time reading to understand what was happening, and while it does take away from the experience somewhat, the movie is so compelling and gripping that it does little to distract you from the incredible experience. Something triggered in my brain 11 years later that made me want to see this movie again, and I just finished watching it and now that I'm older, found that I appreciated the movie even more this time around. The mixture of fantasy, magic, war, innocence, hatred, love, and the underlying good vs. evil story really are well balanced in this film. I'd have rated it a 10, other than what I mentioned earlier about having to read the subtitles which does slightly detract from the enjoyment. I read in the trivia notes that the writer/director declined a budget of 2x to make the movie in English, so I commend him for making such an amazing film and staying true to his desire to keep it original. A great movie that if you've not seen, you are missing out."
come2whereimfrom,"Nov 18, 2006",6/10,"With crazy characters, teasing trailers, amazing posters and from various magazines more stars than the night sky I was really looking forward to this film. Sadly for me it didn't live up to the expectation. Overly long but with hardly any character development it looks pretty but is actually quite boring. Set in Spain at a time of upheaval the film flips between the real world and that of a fantasy realm created by Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother go to live in a rural area will the evil Captain Vidal, not her father but the father to her unborn brother. From the outset we quickly establish that Vidal is a nasty piece of work who only cares about the baby and victory over his enemies at any cost. Ofelia trapped between the captain, the fighting and her ill mother retreats into a made up world where she will be a princess if she completes three tasks given to her by the faun Pan. What follows is a story of the civil unrest in Spain, violence and all, with occasional dips in to Ofelia's vivid imagination as escape. The trouble is that when in Ofelia's mind we are treated to some of the most beautiful CGI committed to screen but its too few and far between to call this a modern day Alice in wonderland. Pan the faun is probably in the two hour film no more than ten minutes if you add together his screen time and the eye hand guy that dominates a lot of the posters and screen shots is only in it for a couple of minutes if that. Sadly billing this as a fantasy film is slightly misleading there is more set in the real world as Vidal and his soldiers try and flush the rebels out of the surrounding woods. All the elements are in place, a passionate visionary director, a story with some truth to it, top notch CGI, great actors, amazing score etc but it always feels that something is missing. I'm sure that the film is packed full of metaphors that when in Ofelia's mind relate to the real world but after sometime I stopped looking for them and started looking for what made all the critics salivate, I haven't seen so much praise heaped on a film for ages but unfortunately for me I couldn't quite see why it deserved so much. Pan's isn't a bad film just, unlike myself, go in without any preconceptions and you will probably enjoy it a hell of a lot more."
robertllr,"Jun 29, 2007",1/10,"This movie could well be one of the worst films ever made. I only wish I could give it the negative-ten stars it richly deserves. Indeed, I only continued to watch it (after the first graphic and brutal murder) to see the depths to which film making of this type can sink.How deep can it sink then? Very deep...deeper in fact than you can possibly imagine. This movie has not the slightest speck of originality, wit, or even meaning in it. From beginning to end, it is no more than a sadistic gore-fest masquerading as an art film. As for its vaunted production values, I find myself astounded that anyone would find them remarkable. Design? It's all been done before in any one of dozens of modern fantasy movies. (Here I must admit, however, that I am puzzled that modern movie goers still find that sort of thing interesting. Special effects have now reached a level of sophistication beyond which there can be little technical improvement. As a result, no bizarre fantasy, no matter how gloriously depicted, will ever enchant the intelligent viewer--unless the images can engender something more than a ""gee, whiz"" responsethat is, unless the images mean something.) Creating images with meaning is what good film making has always been all about. But the images in this film mean nothing. The story is bankrupt, too, with characterizations that are laughably cartoonish, and implied values that are hopelessly vague, jejune, or even outright contradictory.However, even worse than the movie itself, perhaps, is the moronic praise that this piece of tripe has garnered in what (I am now realizing) is a depressingly demented world of film criticism.Alas, further words fail me. But there are a good number of well-written reviews on this site that take the time to painstakingly spell out some of the many shortcomings of the film. So, if you despise this movie as much as I do, I heartily recommend perusing those reviews as an antidote to the pain and outrage you are feeling at, A) having wasted your time on this stuff, and B) having shaken your head to the point of a headache at the critical praise that has been heaped on it."

elicopperman,"Nov 24, 2017",9/10,"This is the first film I've seen from dark fantasy film director Guillermo del Toro, and I don't think I've seen a movie that changed my perception of fantasy films as much as this. I am not kidding when I say that this movie is disturbing beyond reason, as it centers around a girl named Ofelia who moves in with her stepfather, the tyrannical Captain Vidal, while also living in her own imagination. Once she's at the residence of her stepfather, Ofelia discovers a mysterious labyrinth and meets a fan who sets her on a path to save herself as well as her severely ill mother. As time goes on though, there is a blur in the lines between fantasy and reality, and Ofelia soon encounters a horrific battle between Good and Evil.Right off the bat, the world building of the fantasy elements this film offers is incredible. The film has a very gritty and dark setting in the real world given the civil war happening, and as such the world Ofelia imagines is so grim yet imaginative that you wanna see more of it. The creatures in design are beyond words, whether it be the creature Pan (performed extraordinarily well by Doug Jones), to the fairies, to even a Pale Man, and considering that the film mixes animatronics and CGI along with makeup and costumes really brings the effects to new heights. It's no wonder the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Best Production Design, because this is like no other world I've ever seen in a fantasy film.As for the content, I did think that the arch of Captain Vidal got in the way of Ofelia's story a lot, and because of this it almost feels like two different movies are contrasting each other. However, it all fits with the dark world that Ofelia would go into, and since it's hard for her to witness such heinous acts in the real world, her imagination seems to take note and it creates a beautiful Gothic nightmare within itself. I could never stop rooting for Ofelia to just get away from such a horrid man or even life, and even though the trials she gets into in her own world are fake, the film succeeds in creating suspense between her relation with her mother and stepfather and what she can do to save herself.To quote film critic Jim Emerson, Pan's Labyrinth is ""a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children"" As fantasy oriented as they are, fairy tales have never shied away from letting out their inner horrors, and those horrors have shaped kids into adults for the better. Pan's Labyrinth brings fantasy into such a grim underworld for a little girl's imagination that it fits beautifully with the contrast of reality and fantasy that can bring adults into this spellbinding fable. If you watch this film, you may never look at fantasy the same way again, but it will bring you back to a time when you cherished imaginary worlds as much as the next child."
fatherdewitt,"Aug 25, 2018",10/10,"I'm very critical of the movies I watch so I only seek to find the best ones after hours of diving on the internet. Accidentally, I ended up finding this and I don't regret it at all. It's odd and thrilling storyline capture your attention from the very beginning which most movies have trouble doing most of the time. Once this movie is over you'll definitely wish it didn't end. (This was hard not spoil)"
nikxatz,"Mar 19, 2017",9/10,"Pan's labyrinth is surely one of the best fantasy films of time because it is a fantasy film full symbolisms and life lessons about pain,love and mostly about humans and their behavior.The movie has an eye-catching plot,combining fantastic elements with war and a lot of drama,some well developed and enjoyable characters like Pan,great music and of course a satisfying ending that makes the film far far greater,showing that we should sacrifice for our love ones and generally for others and our sacrifice will make us happier.This magical movie also shows the cruelty of human beings and shows that war makes people miserable and does not allow them to dream and hope.Pan's Labyrinth has a really dark tone as a film,which makes the movie more interesting and fascinating.It isn't like other fantasy films that show only the good side of life,but gives emphasis to the dark times that people phased during that times.The ending is so good because its tragic and happy at the same time!The director created a labyrinth that none of us would want to leave.A dark,deep and surely a film that is hard to forget."
jayjaycee,"Mar 27, 2020",10/10,"""El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)"" is a 2006 Spanish fantasy drama directed by Guillermo Del Toro starring Ivana Baquero and Sergi Lopez. After the recent watch of ""A Monster Calls"" I thought it was time to rewatch one of the film's most obvious influences. What makes this watch so special is the simple fact that I experienced it in the original Spanish version, of course with subtitles. Cause you know, I don't speak Spanish at all, but I wanted to see it as original as possible.
In the past, a trio of Mexican directors have established themselves in modern Hollywood and are jokingly known as the ""Mexican Trinity"" nowadays. Those directors are Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro G. Innaritu and Guillermo Del Toro, all three are not only Academy Award winners, they also managed to make successful films in both English and their own mother language. In the case of Del Toro, his hugest success is this fantastic fantasy drama. As initially stated, I've already seen it roughly two years ago and it already amazed me back then. Now upon a rewatch, I see myself appreciating it even more. The director has put all blood, sweat and tears into this project and it's palpable in every single minute of runtime. He's created a nightmarish fairy tale that consists of countless small facets that make it so incredibly outstanding. What probably makes this film so legendary is simply how it looks. From start to finish it's absolutely picturesque and colorful, the visuals are nothing but stunning. On top of that, it doesn't only look incredible, it's at the same time ingeniously captured. DP Navarro did his best work in here and is one of the main reasons the film works out so well. But it's not only the superb style, it's also the story that makes it so uniquely precious. The Mexican mastermind has written and enacted a compelling and perfectly paced dark coming of age tale of a young girl during the Spanish war. In the course of this, he doesn't only manage to create realistic characters with complex personalities, he also succeeds to draw on a number of genres without letting it become a mess. What this film combines is nothing short of masterclass writing. On the core it's a packing history drama that elegantly weavers to together itself with fantasy and horror elements. Fairies and Fauns in a war drama? So strangely experimental. The Pale Man? Absolutely horrifying and iconic. As if that wasn't enough, the film even offers subtle social criticism with a juxtaposition of the war infected reality with the terrifying fantasy world, but it obviously comes to the conclusion that the reality is the true horror in this. While the CGI isn't quite the most outstanding (come on, it's no Hollywood blockbuster!), it still offers shockingly brutal make up effects that underline this statement. All in all, this film is hands down one of the most masterfully crafted feature films of all time. Not only does it have a breathtakingly beautiful story, it also has excellent acting performances a captivating plot and eerie visuals. It's a unique piece of art that combines countless aspects to sheer brilliance. Its overall tone end especially the ending might be sad, but it's never too depressing. The film effortlessly manages to hit you at the whole range of human emotions. Every director has a masterpiece and this is without a doubt Del Toro's magnum opus and probably one of the best Spanish films of all time. An absolutely beautiful dark fairy tale that anyone should have seen at least once."

greene-1,"Dec 9, 2006",7/10,"del Toro interweaves the mundane and the magical in this account of a girl whose mother has married and been impregnated by a Fascist army captain during the Spanish civil war. The Captain has decided that the progeny will be a son, and that the son should be with the father. Therefore the heavily pregnant mother, with the daughter in tow, is carted into an army camp in the middle of the countryside deep within guerrilla territory. This gives the backdrop to the film, not only in terms of locale, but also the character played by Sergi López, whose portrayal of a cold blooded man with an appetite for gratuitous brutality is positively chilling.In this situation, the girl, Ofelia, becomes drawn into a parallel world, totally alien to the various domestic and military issues which envelop the camp, but which nevertheless has an impact on those close to her. As events spiral seemingly out of control in both arenas, Ofelia is faced with intractable choices in which principles in one world or the other will be compromised.While the inventiveness and poetry of the mystical aspect positively transports the viewer into a magical dimension, it has to be said that the 'normal' aspect is as harsh as can be and provides an uncomfortable juxtaposition, a bit like offsetting the Chronicles of Narnia against Apocalypse Now.At its core this film is about sacrifice. It's about just how much people will endure, what they will go through, what dangers they will face, in whatever world, to stand by their principles and those they love."
deloudelouvain,"Jul 14, 2025",9/10,"Guillermo del Toro, a writer/director that I really like, has a vivid imagination, creating the most bizarre and weird creatures. Pan's Labyrinth is to me his best work thus far. I loved a lot of his other movies but Pan's Labyrinth just stands out from the rest, it's definitely on another level. The cinematography is like it always is with him, excellent, extraordinary and visually different. The acting in Pan's Labyrinth is also excellent, from the kid to the fascist to the fawn, they all were very convincing. It's one of those movies you remember and that you will want to watch again some day. In my case it was the second viewing and I will probably watch it again in the future."
armandopaparicio1,"Aug 26, 2016",8/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful film both dark and heavy in art, yet very real and far from being horror. It's essentially about a young girl who stumbles onto a fantasy world hidden in plain sight. She learns to see and interpret the signs and rules, all while living under the roof of an evil army officer. It deals with war, but on a small scale in an isolated environment, creating a perfect world where reality and fantasy blend together to the point that one loses track and lets themselves believe in the magic. The rural and dangerous setting also creates a sense of imprisonment, leaving the characters with an internal struggle about whether to flee or face their fears. One of Del Toro's best works, Pan's Labyrinth is masterfully executed with superb acting and phenomenal character design and will be remembered for a very long time. A must see for anyone who appreciates design work."
grahamvandyke,"Nov 4, 2022",10/10,"One could easily mistake Pan's Labyrinth for a children's movie, born of fantasy and leaving something to be yearned in ways of substance. In actuality, it could be a child's movie.. if you wished to traumatize them with nightmares for the foreseeable future.Pan's Labyrinth is an absolute masterpiece from Guillermo del Toro that seamlessly blends fantasy, the brutal reality of war and the imagination of a young girl who's looking to hide herself away from the tragedy around her.. or is she? This movie is perfectly paced, beautifully shot, wonderfully scored and expertly put together into simply one of the best movies ever made.I really can't say enough positive things to do this movie justice, so just watch it, and thank me later.10/10."
lyre,"Jan 8, 2007",6/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film.The story lines are well crafted, subplots are expertly woven together, emotions are evoked without it seeming heavy-handed.The acting is excellent all around, and the film looks gorgeous.If only there was less gratuitous violence and bloodshed.After the first scene of cruelty and gore, we get the idea. But Del Toro doesn't stop there. He keeps showing is more and more of the same.For me, that changed my rating from a 9 or 10 down to a 6.Without so much violence, this could have been one of favorite movies of all time. With it, I doubt I'll watch it again."
kercherdillon,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"There is no need for me to say more than what others have said before me.This is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that has invoked emotions of fear, love, drama, and anger on an INCREDIBLY deep level.The scary scenes are truly horrifying, the scenes of love are truly mesmerizing, the scenes of drama are truly sad, the scenes of anger are truly infuriating.Watch this movie. It is an absolute masterpiece. A movie that transcends any stereotype you may view movies in. Movies simply are not made in this fashion. Before or after. You will watch this movie and you will never see another like it."
Kademan-02092005,"Sep 7, 2024",8/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a great dark fantasy film, leaning more into the cruelties of the real world to create a better sense of desperation in searching for a better life.The story is excellently subversive, taking a war drama approach in the first half, then taking many twists and turns into a fantastical and labyrinthine plot supported by 1940s Spain as a horrifying backdrop. The characters are all great, from Sergi López as Captain Vidal to Maribel Verdú as Mercedes, and Doug Jones especially as both the Faun and the Pale Man. Ivana Baquero as Ofelia was very compelling for a kid actor and was a great lead. All the creature designs were grotesquely gorgeous, grounding fantastical elements of their appearances in a way that's both terrifying and intriguing. And the ending leaves a particular feeling of satisfaction that rounds it all out perfectly.However, the beginning of the story feels like it's taking a bit to get started, and once it does it feels like it's rushed in a small handful of moments. Also, a few characters make some questionable decisions that feel somewhat dumb, but didn't bother too much.Overall, the film works great as both a period piece drama and an escapist dark fantasy, providing equal amounts of disturbing and wonderous imagery."
SimpingComics,"Apr 18, 2025",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films that sticks with you in many ways. When you are watching things unfold a curiosity for where the plot is going overtakes you, creating anticipation while immersed in the experience. No matter which direction that you guessed it was going , you were completely wrong. The adaptation of a period piece mixed with fantasy creates a fusion that leaves me wanting more. A dark fantasy, in which the creatures are unfamiliar to me and not the usual aesthetic of creatures or creepy that I'm used to. The story is somber at times. What this picture provides is a creative master piece. All in all a great movie."
gusrs,"Oct 22, 2016",10/10,"This film is, put simply, exquisite. Guillermo Del Toro has crafted something truly awe- inspiring. The direction is sublime and the acting, particularly that of Sergio Lopez is incredible.In particular, the creatures of Doug Jones are some of the most stunning, creepy practical effects.The score is both haunting and soothing, and the screenplay is fantastic. I adore this film, and, in fact, it is one of my all-time favourites. It just gets everything right.Beautiful and majestic, somber and mournful, this film is the embodiment of thematic imagery without resorting to just that (a story as well).*However, I do dislike the loose title translation. It's actual name is 'The Labyrinth of the Faun.'"
Solarpegasu,"Mar 19, 2025",10/10,"Few films can leave an impressive memory on you like this film. This film is beyond any doubt one of those films. There is nothing bad i can say about this film, absolutely nothing. It's just that perfect. It shows the pure evil horror of humanity while also showing the pure beauty of the fantasy world that she escapes to. The music score helps you feel the greatness of the film. It's not a horror movie or a fantasy film, but a film that makes you think about the darkness of the world, while hoping for something beautiful. DelToro shows how evil fascism was and how it brutal it was in realistic ways. At the same time he shows it how beautiful the fantasy world can be. The films leaves it open to what it all means but neither less leaves us with no dry eyes. An absolute masterpiece. One of my favorite films ever."
acegoldring,"Mar 23, 2018",9/10,"After all the rave reviews I've seen, I'm glad I finally got around to watching this.Guillermo Del Toro is arguably one of the best filmmakers I've heard of. This film is genius and beautiful. It has a great balance of fantasy and reality/history. The acting, especially from the young protagonist, is incredible. Her character was so easy to care about and sympathize with. There's just something really captivating about this film.It might be a bit ambiguous and I think it's supposed to be; it blurs the lines between reality and imagination. It's enlightening and heartbreaking. I'd definitely recommend this movie. I've never seen anything like it and it definitely lives up to the hype."
karimmusallem,"Dec 12, 2025",10/10,I can safely assume that for director Guillermo del Toro This movie is a bliss & a curse at the same time. Bliss because it is simply perfection on all levels. A curse because the director probably realizes deep within himself that he'll never be able to match this level of perfection ever again in any of the movies he will present...
saskpareki,"Mar 12, 2022",6/10,So he makes sure that everybody watches it and show us who the 'really bad' guys are and who the good guys are.Pretty good movie if it was presented right it could mean something.Thank god with that ending he ruined it all and made the bad look good again. Everybody deserves an honourable death.
babaism,"Jun 5, 2007",3/10,"Just seen the movie only now out on Swedish screens. What a disappointment. I prepared myself for a beautifully done fantasy movie (judging from the trailers and the awards) and instead... instead I had a few scenes of fantasy in the context of a pseudo-historical Z movie, with trashy violence (that I found completely non functional to the story) and psychologically inconsistent characters. The movie looses tracks so many times you start thinking you are watching something that has not yet gone through a serious cut. Yes, you will notice a lot of post-production, but what about the cohesion and the necessity of the different scenes... do they hold? Ajajaj Gullermo Del Toro... what did you want to do with this movie? Why couldn't you choose a theme? You ended up making a weak hybrid that does not convince either the fans of splatter nor the fans of fantasy movies.Go back to school."
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Mar 17, 2020",9/10,"This was a great movie. thank heavens it was not produced in hollywood otherwise it would be just another ""bad nazi"" movie probably about how ann frank defeated an outpost using her imagination with unnecessary cleavage, panties, nudity and sex . this movie was far above hollywood trash. it isn't much suited for children due to the violent nature and am not even sure females would like it. for me, the story made sense, the action continuous and violence memorable. outside of the movie itself, the actors were great, it was directed by a professional and the whole production was so perfect it was invisible to the story."

TheMovieDiorama,"Mar 27, 2020",10/10,"Francoist Spain, 1944. Five years after the Spanish Civil War, a dictatorship controls the meandering roads and bustling cities. The political authoritarian ideology of unifying Spain and eliminating regional separatism. An emergent battle between Falangism and the republican resistance formed. Innocent individuals punished with ration cards and intense scrutiny. Only enforcers of the totalitarian principles garnered true freedom. Captain Vidal, the son of a famed commander, treated like royalty. A king. His new wife, inflicted with the pain of a brutal pregnancy, ordered to join him at a rural command post. Her daughter, ten year-old Ofelia, reluctantly obeying her mother's wish. To treat the captain as a father.War ravages on. The Falangists luring the rebellious Spanish Marquis to the very abode Ofelia and Carmen rest at. The young, imaginative Ofelia is not alone during these times of turmoil. A pointed stick insect, believed to be a mystical fairy, leads Ofelia to an adjacent stone labyrinth where its walls echo tainted history for the trials soon to arrive. Once successfully navigated, an imposing faun greets the naive child, persuading her that she is the reincarnation of an ancient princess whose father is the king of the underworld. She must successfully complete three trials in order to acquire immortality and be resurrected in her kingdom. And thus beings a fantastical quest of escape. A desperate flee from the grotesque reality Ofelia currently copes with.Del Toro's legendary dark fantasy drama is a seamless blend of compelling war tirades and endless imagination. Both encompassing the thematic portrayal of disobedience and choice, two pivotal convictions that commenced the feud with the dictatorship originally. Ofelia often disregards her adolescence to allow her mind to distract from the nihilistic virtues of Vidal. Disobeying the captain himself, her mother and the faun. Challenging the orders given to her, in reality Ofelia symbolises the Spanish Maquis. Her fantastical tasks that she endeavours to complete however, perpetuate the greed and oppression of the captain. Retrieving a key from the belly of filthy giant toad, who prevents an ornate tree from flourishing. Retrieve a dagger from the lair of the terrifying child-eating monster, where she is instructed not to consume any of the food items presented. These dream scenarios immortalise the oppressive consequences of fascism, integrated seamlessly in an already melancholic reality.Del Toro, whom hints at various mythologies, crafts a fantasy that relishes in its darkened style. Whilst being inspired by Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland', a young girl who seeks to escape her reality, the Mexican director wholesomely places his own spin on the tale. The trials are just as nightmarish as the reality Ofelia imagines herself out of, supplying the harrowing idea that reality is inescapable. She's constantly reminded to ""stop reading fairy tales"", to ""grow up"" and to ""stop believing in fairies"". Removing her child-like qualities indefinitely. All that remains is loss, grief and destruction. Bolstered by a screenplay that explores the painful bonds of a broken family during a time of distress, Del Toro inserts a sense of hopelessness throughout. Innocence is extinguished. Happiness devoured by the jaws of retribution. The important yet depressing conclusion surmising the preceding journey exquisitely, as poetic as the lullaby strung throughout Ofelia's arduous quest, composed hypnotically by Navarrete as he heightens the allurement of dreamlike qualities.The fairy tale of Princess Moanna brought to life through expertly crafted production design and creature aesthetics, utilising minimal visual effects in the process. Jones, dual-casted as the faun and Pale Man, enduring extensive costume and makeup applications to materialise two cinematic icons in the fantasy genre. Exceptional work from all departments. Baquero's vulnerable performance as Ofelia simultaneously conjures an infliction of sadness, fear and joy in an incredibly nuanced multi-faceted character. López as the antagonistic Vidal brings life to one of cinema's most degenerative characters ever. Ruthless and remorseless. He himself endures some succinct makeup and visual effects when relentlessly slaughtering the rebels he captures. Navarro's cinematography, frequently accompanied with a pale blue tint, enhances the illusory nature of Pan's Labyrinth with the bright, golden shades of the underworld juxtaposing the cold shades of reality. In theory, the two colour schemes should be reversed, yet it cements Del Toro's vision that Francoist Spain was even more hellish than the underworld itself.Without discussing the pivotal role of Mercedes or Doctor Ferreiro's heroic deed, Pan's Labyrinth has substantial depth to its visual narrative. Producing a surreal, ethereal and phantasmagorical tale of a country's ""unity"" relinquished by oppression, reducing a nationwide battle into a whimsical fairy tale. The grim realities of warfare paralleling the descent into an idyllic underworld. Pan's Labyrinth is Guillermo del Toro's magnum opus. A poem that surrounds itself in visual perfection and imaginary wonderment. And with that said, Pan's Labyrinth undoubtedly claims an elusive perfect rating. A labyrinthine parable that succinctly cements itself as timeless."
skinnercolin221,"May 29, 2023",9/10,"It's beautiful in a dark sort of way. And depending on which way you take it it's either just beautiful or just incredibly sad. What I mean by this is that the movie gives the viewer the option to decide whether it really is a fairytale or the girl is just out of her mind and using a coping mechanism.The violence is definitely gratuitous. Some of the monster madness is quite disturbing. So it's not necessarily some thing I would want to watch again, but I rated highly because it was incredibly compelling and the disturbing aspects were what made that possible. In other words, it made some scary bad guys.So her overcoming the fear of authority was all the more powerful and personally I choose to believe she was a princess."
jabarker81,"Jan 30, 2018",10/10,"Guillermo Del Toro worked his ass off, creating this film, and the outcome is absolutely breathtaking. This is one of my favorite films of all time. It's suspenseful. It's tear-jerking. It's thrilling. It's has you engaged from beginning to end. The best part of this movie is that it's a Spanish spoken film. A lot of foreign language movies in America are completely overlooked because of the other movies that are being advertised, but Pan's Labyrinth doesn't do that. It stays in your mind forever. What do you get when you cross Guillermo Del Toro's dark imagination, a frightening performance from Sergi Lopez, and a fragile performance from Ivana Baquero? Two words: Pan's Labyrinth."
bladefd,"Mar 13, 2025",8/10,"PAN'S LABYRINTH is a dark fantasy drama from Mexico by esteemed director (and writer) Guillermo del Toro. This film takes place after the Spanish Civil War, when fascist Francisco Franco won the conflict and his Nationalist forces took over Spain. But that sets the atmosphere and conditions; this is not quite a war movie. The dark realism of the real world melts into the magical fantasy of a fairy tale. Although the two stories could be separated, they mesh well together. Reality with fantasy, fact with fiction, dark with light, corrupt with pure, and fear with hope. I had no real expectations, and the first half hour appeared uncertain. The plot appeared clear, but I wasn't sure how it would become a fantasy until later. Part of the issue was my failure to grasp the myriad of metaphors and messages. It's undoubtedly an intelligent script and filming with layers and meaning behind the intricate details. However, it might take multiple watches to appreciate the nuances that went into it. The film is dark, gritty, and violent, something Del Toro is famous for.In 1944, a ten-year-old girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), travels with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) to stay with her stepfather, the ruthless Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Vidal is one of Franco's officers, a sadist and vicious torturer, waging war against revolutionary rebels fighting for democracy in the nearby forest. Ofelia's mother is also ill from her complicated pregnancy. Within that story, Guillermo del Toro brings together a fantasy story. A fairy meets Ofelia and takes her to meet an ancient faun (half-human and half-goat being) in the labyrinth. The faun tells her she is a reincarnation of an ancient princess and offers her three tasks to reclaim her old life as a princess.From a technical perspective, this film is innovative in its cinematography and effects. The film had magnificent visuals, solid acting, a fitting score, outstanding directing, and a script. Del Toro does a decent job of bringing the fantasy to life through the grand set designs. The story is well-crafted and details receive ample attention. I can't say enough about the child actor Ivana Baquero. Her performance was sensational. For films such as these, you may expect heavy CGI usage, but they kept it to a minimum. I believe he could have further explored and developed the fantasy elements. The ending, while sensible, felt strangely abrupt.Some interesting trivia tidbits I found. Del Toro had been working on PAN'S LABYRINTH for years before he left his notes in the cab. The cab driver found him and returned the notes to him. Otherwise, this film's production would not have happened. Del Toro wrote the English subtitles himself to prevent any translation errors. Del Toro gave up his full salary to make this film, even though he had offers for more money from Hollywood studios. He preferred making the film his way without constraints or changes being forced. Baquero, who plays Ofelia, was only eleven years old during filming. This film received 6 Oscar nominations and won three for cinematography, art direction, and makeup.Would I recommend this? Yes, it's something I recommend if you like fantasy films. While the film has multiple intense scenes of brutal violence, its overall impact is memorable and effective. It's not a family-friendly fantasy, but I didn't think it was vulgar. The torture scenes happened off-screen, but there was killing and shooting. The English subtitles are easy to follow. My rating is 8/10.*Any trivia facts were obtained from IMDB's trivia page and plot/name information from Wiki."
briancham1994,"Nov 15, 2020",9/10,"This film is an interesting synthesis between a Franco era war film and a dark fantasy fairytale story. In some ways it reminds me of Spirited Away in that it features a young girl sucked into a fantasy otherworld with a lot of symbolism and interpretations. This film, however, is far more violent and tragic in both of the worlds. The art design and mythological feeling are amazing, and even better, they feed into an overall significance that is more than the sum of its parts."
LW-08854,"Dec 25, 2023",8/10,"First off this is on great looking film, on Blu-ray this looks magnificent, with a 16:9 aspect ratio it just looks superb, there's so much colour and depth to each frame, it's like you could reach out and touch it, there's never that flat digital look either you get with many modern films. This could be up there with some of the best looking films I've seen, The way the woods alone is shot with so much colour and light is wonderful, its like you can see and feel the beams of light, the pollen in the air. The film follows heavy themes of death, life, fascism, obedience and disobedience, as well as fantasy v reality. The casting, acting, camerawork and editing is fantastic. Rather than having monsters as a metaphor for humans or fascists in this the fascists literally are the monsters and the fantasy monsters are more imaginary than real perhaps. At night the creaky old house we find ourselves in seems to come to life with magic and noises. The plot involves a girl brought to a house in the woods by her mother, pregnant and unwell with her new stepfather, a captain in the Spanish army trying to defeat partisans in the area who he suspects locals may be aiding. The film's cinematography deserves huge praise, the way the camera moves and spins and glides through the locations in a way which might normally annoy me but absolutely works in this genera. The film has some very heavy violence, swearing, scenes of torture, it's not a film for children to be clear. The step father is a complete pig, there's no attempt really to soften his character, he's obsessed with simply ruthlessly destroying his enemies and making sure he has a son, everything is just a means to an end. That's not to say he's not an interesting or complicated character though, you spend a lot of time with him in the film and the acting is all round excellent, especially from such a young talent playing the lead. Scenes in the rain somehow look even more dazzling than in the sun, while the film has a very strong sense of fear and distress to it the ending felt slightly forced though with a few things happening I didn't quite believe even though our main antagonist describes pride as being his weakness, characters happen to be exactly where they are needed to be when it suits the story, otherwise though it's a really excellent film."
drqshadow-reviews,"Oct 28, 2025",9/10,"Dark, twisted and meaningful, like the best fairy tales, Pan's Labyrinth mixes elements of dream, fantasy, history and horror in a single, simmering vat. At its center is Ofelia, a young girl struggling to retain innocence in the aftermath of an ugly civil war. Though the conflict is officially over, resistance outfits still dot the countryside, disrupting the fascist transition with guerrilla raids and ambushes. As the adopted daughter of an occupying officer, Ofelia's caught in the middle and uses her imagination to escape as often as she can. In the wilds of 1940s Spain, there's plenty of room to indulge those whims. Amidst the split trees and stone monuments, she finds an overlap between fact and fable, where strange creatures roam the shadowy overgrowth and fill little heads with ripe delusions.Ofelia doesn't always know who to trust, and neither do we. In these unstable political times, the right secret in the wrong ears can be fatal. Thus, everyone in town is extremely guarded and suspicious, and the mythical creatures in the girl's fantasies follow suit. Tangible fears color her invisible fancies. Like the rebels she admires, though, and the pregnant mother she adores, Ofelia endures and persists. In both worlds.I'm not sure which side of the story is most unsettling. The dreams are certainly more vivid, which makes them more memorable. Writer/director Guillermo Del Toro sends this sweet young thing into all sorts of terrifying nightmare scenarios, dim and musky corridors of ancient evil with unsightly guardians. This is all incredibly realized, a genuinely disturbing realm of ornate uglies that borrows from and iterates upon the director's preceding work in Hellboy. I fell into the mental trap of expecting less from a foreign-language film and was bowled over by the top-notch costume and atmospheric effects. Pan's Labyrinth delivers on the premise and then some, lending an air of strange possibility to its fiction. This looks good enough to believe in.There's ample heart to go with that imagination, too. Heavy heart, with a lot of looking-through-our-fingers moments, but heart all the same. It's not easy to marry reverie with reality, to tangle the two until they reach a cloudy, extra middle ground, but Del Toro has managed it. The grandness of this drama, and the bittersweet nature of its twin conclusions, is a crooked parable on par with the Brothers Grimm."
Maryam-Jabr,"Aug 16, 2022",10/10,You will never get bored.A very pure movie that shows the good in some people in this world. With excellent acting and directing.A very lovely movie that i do recommend with an idea and a lesson that is shared.
KhallilR,"Jan 25, 2020",10/10,"Insanely good
Historical time is beautiful. Spain during the civil War
You learn about the revolutionaries, also about their dreams
The fantasy makes sense
You emphasize with the girl, through the fantasy you see her dreams and hopes
The villain is scary. The general is one of the best villains
One of the most beautiful endings. I cried.
You feel ""woooah"" at the beauty
The music complements the story perfectly"
jshayeb-55160,"Sep 26, 2018",10/10,"Pan's Labyrinth (2006), a drama and suspense packed Spanish film directed by Guillermo del Toro that had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the unfolding of the two storylines that take place. Initially this idea may seem to be a concerning as it could cause the film to lose a sense of depth, but reassured the film is full of substance as it seamlessly transitions between war and fairytale till the very end when it all fits together quite nicely. The story follows Ofelia, a 12 year old girl as she begins her new life under her new stepfather the brutal and intense Captain Vidal, who never seemed fond of Ofelia to begin with. Ofelia sets up upon a magical journey where her goal is to complete 3 difficult at times tasks, and Captain Vidal is going to great lengths to maintain his regime and eradicate the Republicans. Guillermo del Toro's film works because he allows us to build an emotional bond with his characters through a fantastic premise. The film possess a good mix of pain and joy, and just the right amount of light humor, such as the working women interacting in the kitchen.When looking at the editing of the film, my biggest take way was the different colored camera filters used throughout the film, which worked perfectly. Using blue filters during more sad scenes helped us sympathize with characters, while yellow filters put a smile on our faces as they portrayed hope.This film is an absolute must see, a true masterpiece to say the least. The film is just really well organized, as Guillermo del Toro magically takes two very different stories and almost seems to tell them at the same time without missing a beat as they constantly build off each other, until they become one. Overall, in my opinion the amazing balance of bitter sweet moments really made this one of kind, ten out of ten hands down."
King-Beyond-The-Wall,"Feb 28, 2016",8/10,"Pan's Labyrinth is a movie that's been high on my watch list for quite a while. What I had heard of it really sparked my interest. So finally sitting down to watch it, I was taken aback. The film gradually descends into a dark, dark place. And the movie hits you and it hits you hard and never lets you get up again. And I god damn love it.After the initial introduction, we're very well aware of the world we're entering. It's a country tortured by civil war. So straight up, you're in a dark place. And as the film progresses, it only gets worse. The darkness of the mythical side is truly scary and with this combination of real and mythical fear, this dark undertone never leaves me and I was always on edge.The acting was superb even from young Ofelia. The cinematography was great and all the characters work very well together to form a cohesive story. The special effects were eerily beautiful.Overall, a beautifully dark film that I thoroughly enjoyed."
