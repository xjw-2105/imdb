FilmOtaku,"Apr 11, 2004",9/10,"I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films.  It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life  when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly"
bat-5,"Aug 4, 1999",N/A,"Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people.  For Norma Desmond, fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her.  Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis.  For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life.  Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is.  Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic.  He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory.  In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity.  As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world.  A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all.  After all, stars never age."
preppy-3,"Mar 15, 2008",10/10,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday"" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.""I am big--it's the pictures that got small"". ""All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup""."
AlsExGal,"Sep 3, 2021",10/10,"... how would you feel if the sexes of the characters were reversed? Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood, completely broke who, due to a flat tire, wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered, she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly, what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion, her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed, she is never paid the promised cash for her work, a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy, and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?So I think Wilder meant for the audience to sympathize with Joe. Sure he makes some questionable moral moves, but he is to some degree cornered. He would have to get a hand out from somebody to go back to his job that he hates at the copy desk in Ohio, and his pride wouldn't let him. Also, some say he becomes attracted to Norma. He at best is giving her pity sex and at worst duty sex. He looks either revolted or bored every time she touches him.There are just great performances and interesting characters all around. Unpopular opinion here - I never thought Gloria Swanson was a pretty woman, but she had such severe features that she could come across as an attractive yet unhinged woman for age 50 as Norma. Eric Von Stroheim as Max. He was a great director who lets his obsession with Norma delude them both. And then there is Betty Schaefer, the down to earth girl who does the 50s thing and gets engaged to a man the way you would buy a car - she picks something reliable and likeable and omits passion from the equation. And then she finds passion. There could have been a sequel noir with her married to the dull dutiful Artie when she begins to call the mailman by his first name. The postman would only have to ring once in her case. But I digress.This is also a great look at Hollywood and Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. It's too bad we don't have more actual films from Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. To me this is a perfect film."
Don-102,"Apr 22, 1999",10/10,"Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. ""Norma Desmond"" and ""Joe Gillis"" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned ""10,000 midnights ago"". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard (""That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps."" says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying ""give and take"" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even ""wax figures"" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ""ruining the industry"". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have ""changed"". They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that ""Valentino once danced on."" There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10"
belikemichaeldotcom,"Jul 2, 2004",10/10,"This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin.  It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note.  If that weren't enough, there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era).  What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): ""...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces"", I'd like to also add that they ""didn't need movies; they had films.""They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10"
queenruejean,"Mar 12, 2005",10/10,"Although this movie was made 8 years before I was, I saw it for the first time yesterday and I was blown away! I have spent my life missing what has just become one of my favorite movies of all time.The acting was superb, the storyline riveting and the characters were people you could care about. Max was my personal favorite. There was a quiet, tragic dignity to him. I expected something to be revealed about him but was not prepared for the truth.I've always liked William Holden but my experience with Gloria Swanson was limited to her brief role in ""Airport 75"". I will now look for more movies by her. What an expressive face.It was fun to try to recognize some of the old time actors that were portraying themselves.An all around excellent movie. One I truly regret having waited this long to see. But it is definitely a case of better late than never."
lbournelos,"Aug 1, 2019",10/10,"I dare any, studio, producer, director to make TODAY anything even close to that film."
michaelRokeefe,"Dec 7, 1999",7/10,"Director Billy Wilder probably at his best. Shot in black, white and shades of gray; the screen sparkles with the brilliance of the script and very good acting. William Holden plays a once successful script writer down on his luck. He finds himself at the mansion of an aging silent movie star played by Gloria Swanson. She was kind of spooky and a whole lot crazy. Her butler and former husband is played by Erich von Stroheim. A true classic worth watching again."
jotix100,"Aug 29, 2005",10/10,"Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. ""Sunset Boulevard"" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.With the advent of the ""talkies"" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene, they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars, Norma Desmond, lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality, which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis, the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer, all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce, or just were plain, not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg, the loyal servant, who was himself, somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected, but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy, even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis, a character he wasn't even scheduled to play, but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson, having experienced that old Hollywood, was a natural choice to play Norma, which was perhaps, the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim, the great director, himself, is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Anne C. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately, it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic ""Sunset Boulevard""."
Jonny_Numb,"Aug 21, 2006",6/10,"""Sunset Boulevard,"" Billy Wilder's barbed take on the Hollywood studio system during its heyday is by turns volatile, funny, suspenseful, and--at its core--more than a little creepy. By today's standards, this 1950 film still takes some relevant shots at an industry that seldom acknowledges its superficiality, but is also just as dated in other regards. Wilder takes a truly original concept, bending Film Noir, satire, comedy, and pathos in the telling of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (the repo men are threatening to take his car, for Pete's sake!), who winds up all but imprisoned in the lonely, secluded mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a washed-up silent-film starlet harboring delusions of a comeback. When drafted to revise Desmond's self-scripted version of ""Salome,"" Joe becomes very aware of his unhinged provider, and quickly begins a collaboration with the young, rhinoplasty-friendly Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). While Holden and Olson are--in the midst of this send-up--fresh-faced stars, ""Sunset Boulevard""'s axis of madness hinges squarely on Swanson's full-bore performance, a blend of incestuous sexuality and mid-life crisis (she makes Baby Jane seem warm and cuddly by comparison) that makes her advances on Holden genuinely unappealing. The performance is a bit more tricky than one might give credit--as a woman whose fame has declined, her sustained hunger for it fuels her delusion, therefore rendering Norma Desmond an actress who literally acts out her everyday reality, to the point where any semblance of humanity is absent (her actions and words possess the overt dramatics of a woman seeking the Best Actress Oscar). While the film is beautifully photographed and performed, the sheer ambition of the project is something of a flaw--with so many genres represented, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is problematic in synthesizing a coherent vision. But what is here is quite influential, and certainly worth a look."
barnesgene,"Jan 19, 2008",5/10,"Sorry, I have to align myself with those few other reviewers who found the movie, well, trite. Not that it didn't have its moments -- that particularly riveting scene, for instance, where Norma sits in DeMille's chair and a stagehand acquaintance puts a spotlight on her and people begin crowding around her, how spooky can you get? But by and large, Gloria Swanson hams up her lines to the point where she becomes a TV skit caricature (only this skit goes on way too long), Holden runs his lines off too fast, and von Stroheim mumbles all his lines indifferently (I picture him saying to himself, ""Here I am, the genius who directed 'Greed', and what am I doing today??""). Let's face it, folks, this is the kind of claptrap that made the revolution in film-making some 20 years later so necessary, films like ""The French Connection"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" sweeping away the cobwebs of crass melodramas like ""Sunset Boulevard"" and never looking back. Tell me I'm wrong."
Sara_Golfarbs_fate,"Aug 2, 2003",10/10,"Usually, Cinema is considered as the most delicate form of art because it has the biggest potential to become 'dated' one day. Once a movie thought as 'mind-blowing' can easily become a 'turkey' a decade later.This is not the case here. Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood. It can give you the idea of the dream land's transformation into a nightmare.The film is about a troubled script writer 'Joe Gillis and a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond's weird relationship and the madness that surrounds them and the people around them. Don't wanna give much of the plot, on account the fact that it is a pure gem that should be invented without knowing nothing. But I can talk about the cinematic aspects of this movie.This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography. The moments of burying the dead monkey and watching the old film of Norma Desmond are exquisitely presented. The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film. The directing is top-notch but who are we kidding it is Billy 'the great' Wilder. The end of the movie is one of the most chilling part of the movie and it can truly give you some nightmares about insanity. The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage. The Hayes code was at its peak at the beginning of fifties which manipulates the producers to limit their bad thoughts on one subject, especially on Hollywood. The movie got 11 oscar nomination but only got 3 of them. Apparently, the reason was its harsh criticism on Hollywood.There are some arguements about Sunset Boulevard's genre. It is considered as the greatest film-noir of all time. I don't think it is a film-noir at all. For some aspects, the movie has some noirish elements such as the black and white German-expressionist cinematography and an 'on the edge of insanity', femme-fatale but these two are not enough to make a film-noir. I think this is a psyhcological drama with some horror(the end is horrifying for me) and with some very very dark comedy.Overall, This is truly a classic and one of the best movies of cinema history that will never lose its effects on cinema. Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive, also making those movies a must see. 10/10"
Incalculacable,"Mar 4, 2006",10/10,"Sunset Blvd. is a terrifyingly realistic portrayal of a washed up movie silent screen star and her quest to rekindle her popularity... and a poor writer on the run from the police who gets involved with her. The story starts backwards: you see a man floating face down in the water, and so the story begins... how it all started.Norma Desmond is a character that you hate, love and feel sorry for all at the same time... she is very selfish, self absorbed and needy. But I felt a strong pang of sympathy when Norma talks about her script for Salome... how she has such high hopes about her comeback. She just wants to be loved again. I could not imagine anyone else playing Norma Desmond.. Gloria Swanson plays it to perfection. William Holden is great also - and I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it to me, but playing such a casual, nonchalant character such as he did against such a strong character of Norma is quite challenging. He did it wonderfully and delivered the lines with ease.After watching it the first time, I watched the bits I wasn't sure of - I was sure if I liked the lines the way they were delivered - and it grew on me. For example, I always imagined the magnificent last line delivered more slowly than Swanson did it... but as I watched it again, I began to like it more and more. Now that I have watched it twice, I cannot really find anything wrong with this movie. It has it all: drama, romance, two fantastic actors, comedy, emotions of sympathy, hate, greed, lust... I would say this one of the top 5 movies of all time, if not the top.After I saw this for the first time, there was a wonderful feeling as if I had just seen a special bit of movie history... and I was a part of that history. I don't know how to explain it, but it was a great feeling that cannot be described. This can appeal to all ages, from 12 and upward's I'd say! A true Hollywood masterpiece - they don't make 'em like this anymore."
bkoganbing,"Jan 26, 2006",10/10,"In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom.Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband.Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together.Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see."
snow0r,"Apr 14, 2008",10/10,"It so happens that as I was watching Sunset Boulevard, I was chewing gum, and Gloria Swanson's clipped, derisive tone felt more like it was directed not at William Holden's washed up Joe Gillis in 1950, but at me, sitting on my couch in 2008. I didn't throw my gum away like Gillis does, but still, I did feel a little disconcerted. Norma Desmond knew I was chewing, and she didn't like it one bit.But this is part of Sunset Boulevard's charm. While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed, were continuing to change, and those they left behind, it also shows us how, in some ways, they've remained the same. Its references to the WGA, popcorn cinema, and the tragicomic nature of washed-up celebrity feel oddly contemporary while simultaneously being firmly rooted in the Fifties.While some of the period references to actors and directors went over my head - I'm no expert on the silent era - it didn't affect my enjoyment of them one bit. The fact that Wilder and his team were brave enough to include such comments gives the film a cool, relaxed feel even as the web that binds the characters draws ever-tighter.It's fantastically acted too. Holden is brilliant as the struggling everyman who quickly realises that he's gotten way more than he bargained for, and Swanson is pitch-perfect as the faded screen star whose grip on reality has crumbled far quicker than the walls of her mansion, right down to the wide roving eyes and claw-like hands. They're well-supported, especially by Erich von Stronheim's eerily restrained butler Max.Of course, great dialogue and performances are nothing without a plot to match. Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.Very rarely do ""old"" movies actually live up to their reputations, but I'm pleased to say that Sunset Boulevard does, and it's a credit to Wilder's team's ability that this noir-drama stands the test of time. A truly great film."
Boyo-2,"Mar 14, 2000",9/10,"Gloria Swanson must be commended for her bravery in taking a part which may or may not have echoed her own Hollywood career. William Holden took a role which required him to be a kept boy; and he's not the nicest guy in the world either. If this had been made with Mae West and Montgomery Clift, I would probably not be writing this and no one else would give a damn about this movie either.Both of them got Oscar nominations and I am sorry both lost. I am also sorry that ""All About Eve"" won Best Picture that year.  Of course ""Eve"" is a great movie, but its not this.This movie is part of our collective memory and most of the dialogue continues to be quoted even today. Thank God for whatever it was that brought Billy Wilder to Hollywood. I can't think of anyone who did such a wide variety of movies so well.And please, no remakes."
bsinc,"Aug 10, 2003",7/10,"Dom De Luise once uttered a line I use quite often:""Nice, not thrilling, but nice!"" That's exactly how I feel about ""Sunset Blvd."", because as much as the first 30 minutes of it were extremely promising the overly long and much less entertaining middle just slowed the pace a gear to many. I somehow hoped that Joe Gillis would get himself mixed up in a murder case or something, when in fact he wound up being a victim of one in the end.Good performance all around, although not really Oscar worthy(maybe the fact that I saw ""A Man For All Seasons"" just a couple of days ago speaks for itself). I truly hope it wasn't the murder plot or shall I say the final ""twist"" that impressed so many viewers, because as much as it is unusual (and for that time perhaps almost revolutionary) I saw it coming a mile away, which is the main reason with my disappointment with ""Sunset Blvd."" Once I knew exactly what was going to happen there just wasn't any fun in watching the lonesome and forgotten old silent-movie actress tormenting herself and others anymore. I can't figure out why this movie stands so tall in the IMDb 250 greatest; a great beginning, a nice ending and some of the best narration(By William Holden) ever put onto the big screen, but the predictability of it all made ""Sunset Blvd."" overly long and not nearly as pleasing and good as it could have been. 7/10"
claudio_carvalho,"Jan 18, 2008",10/10,"In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched ""Sunset Boulevard"" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called ""Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back"" (a.k.a. ""The Making of Sunset Boulevard"" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Crepúsculo dos Deuses"" (""Dusk of the Gods"")"
roddekker,"Sep 19, 2016",6/10,"For Hollywood (in its heyday) - The 1950's certainly began quite ominously with Billy Wilder's straight-faced freak-show known otherwise as ""Sunset Boulevard"". Without a doubt - This picture is, indeed, an oddity in itself, being a story-of-the-grotesque that is told by, none other than, a corpse.Yes. Perhaps the most revealing movie that Hollywood ever made about its own decline - ""Sunset Boulevard"" was, very much, all about the movie industry's rise to great power, its fabricated imagery, as well as its total worship of youth and its own dark past.And, of course - Irony of ironies - Only director Billy Wilder could imagine Tinseltown as a place where the dead go on speaking - Talking about their lives as if nothing had changed."
Petey-10,"Jul 1, 2004",N/A,"Joe Gillis is floating face down in a pool and tells his story.That story tells how he met Norma Desmond, a big star from the silent era who now is forgotten by the people.She's planning a major comeback with a script of Salome.She wants Joe to help her with the movie.The movie's no good, everybody can see that, but Joe still stays around to help her.Soon he realizes that it was a big mistake.Sunset Blvd. (1950) is a masterpiece from the master called Billy Wilder.The actors are really unique.William Holden is superb as Joe Gillis and Gloria Swanson, an actual silent film star, is absolutely brilliant as Norma.Erich von Stroheim does a wonderful job as Max von Mayerling and so does the beautiful Nancy Olson as Betty Schaefer.In cameos you can see people like Cecil B.DeMille and Buster Keaton.The movie is something really special from the beginning till the end.You can't see movies like this these days.Now we don't have directors like Billy Wilder to make them.In his movies everything usually worked.Especially the dialog was something you don't have so often in modern movies.What happened to the great writers? Only a few seem to exist."
ma-cortes,"Sep 16, 2011",8/10,"This excellent movie with bitter-sweet style deal with a hack , bankrupt screenwriter who writes a screenplay for a former silent-film star who has faded into Hollywood obscurity . It starts in the surprising opening scene by having the flick related by a body floating face-down in a swimming pool . What follows in long flashback is pulls into an ancient mansion in which a writer in search of refuge from his creditors , as he shelters and becomes entangled in the web woven by a known but now forgotten star of the silent cinema , being submitted to humiliation and exploitation . The star named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is high on hopes of a comeback and living in the past with her servant (Erich Von Stroheim).One of Wilder's finest and certainly the blackest and memorably sour of all Hollywood accounts of itself . Splendidly paced , the movie contains melodrama , acidity , bitterness , relentless indictment against Hollywood excesses , suitable sordid interpretations and precise direction . It's an over-the-top picture , though hampered by silly sub-plot related to sentimental triangle between William Holden, Nancy Olson and Jack Webb . Magnificent performances from William Holden as out-of-work gigolo-screenwriter who inextricably attaches himself to a faded possessive screen star ; Swanson is brilliant as the tragically deluded actress and realizes a real tour-de-force and of course superb Erich Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's devotedly watchable butler . Likable appearing in brief card-game scenes from silent stars as H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton , furthermore Hedda Hooper and extraordinary intervention by Cecil B DeMille while filming some scenes of ¨Ten Commandments¨ with Henry Wilconson . This prestigious film deservedly won three Oscars , including best musical score by Franz Waxman , and best screenplay by Wilder and Charles Brackett . Awesome camera-work appropriately ¨Noir¨ by John Seitz .The picture is stunningly directed by Billy Wilder at his best . It belongs his first and better period during the 40s and 50s when realized sensational films as ¨Double indemnity¨, ¨Ace in the hole¨ , ¨Sabrina¨, ¨Stalag 17¨ and ¨Seven year itch¨ ; subsequently in the 60s and 70s he realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨. Rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; harshly funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best movies ever made ."
Doylenf,"Aug 28, 2005",9/10,"WILLIAM HOLDEN really hits his stride in the role of Joe Gillis, the down-on-his-heels writer who just happens to be drowning in debt before he comes upon a secluded and decaying mansion that is about to change his life. Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway"" (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth, conviction and truth.And, of course, GLORIA SWANSON, as Norma Desmond, in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter), is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination, inflating her ego with self-important phrases like: ""It's the pictures that got small."" With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures, she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life, right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When, at the conclusion of the film, she says: ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille"", it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent, including NANCY OLSON, as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films, ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham, she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more, they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor.Summing up: Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note: Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here."
revere-7,"Nov 24, 2008",10/10,"With Sunset Boulevard film noir hit it's crescendo. The genre would linger on, but only as an echo of it's former self, like wind blowing through an old pipe organ. This story of a down on his luck Hollywood screenwriter and his peril fraught associations with a fading silent film star plotting her return to the big screen has all the things a noir fan loves; dark mysterious places, a near constant sense of looming danger, rapid and smart dialog and great narration by William Holden. But the film is about more than that. It is about the rough and perilous life that goes with any work in a business as tumultuous as Hollywood, and the unpredictable nature of celebrity. This is Hollywood shining a spotlight on itself and when the cameras aren't rolling, and the makeup isn't on, it can be a very ugly place indeed."
BlakeC303,"Aug 8, 2025",8/10,"Sunset Boulevard (1950) is a piercing reflection on Hollywood's Golden Age, a time when the industry shimmered with glamour yet concealed a darker undercurrent of impermanence. Billy Wilder's film captures this era's twilight, where silent stars like Norma Desmond, portrayed with aching depth by Gloria Swanson, grapple with obsolescence as talkies reshape the landscape. The introspective narrative probes the cost of fame's fleeting embrace, with William Holden's Joe embodying the era's moral drift. Through shadowy visuals and a mournful score, the film unveils the Golden Age's paradox: a dream factory built on fragile egos and forgotten dreams."

hall895,"Jul 5, 2015",7/10,"Sunset Boulevard is universally acclaimed. It is one of those films which should you dare suggest it is not among the greatest films ever made people think you're an idiot. Well, at the risk of being labeled an idiot, Sunset Boulevard is not among the greatest films ever made. It is a good film, certainly captivating in its own unique, macabre way. But is a film for which reputation outstrips reality.Most everyone is familiar with the story of Sunset Boulevard, that of faded silent film star Norma Desmond. The faded star lives in an equally faded mansion, plotting a comeback which is far-fetched to say the least. Failing screenwriter Joe Gillis stumbles into Norma's bizarre world and, at the price of his dignity, feeds her delusions. A man's gotta make a living and Joe will make his by brushing up the godawful script Norma has written as her comeback vehicle. Joe will soon realize Norma wants him as more than a script doctor. He is to be her lover, a kept man living in her grotesque mansion, surrounded by the relics of Norma's past, reminders of a life which for her is gone forever. Of course in her deluded mind Norma is just as big a star as she ever was. It's the pictures that got small.Gloria Swanson turns in a performance for the ages. Her portrayal of Norma does match the hype, even if the film as a whole may not. The descent into madness is breathtaking to watch. Yes, Swanson is a little over-the-top at times but that is who Norma is. Especially as Norma begins to lose all touch with reality. William Holden, playing Joe, is not bad but certainly not up to the level of Swanson. Joe is a bit of a dry character, he could use some more personality. Holden doesn't make him into as much of a presence as he really needs to be for the film to truly grab you. Erich von Stroheim, playing Norma's ever-faithful butler Max, does have a presence, a quite ominous one. But as we learn more about the character Max becomes less ominous and more sad. It's a sad world Norma Desmond lives in and that sadness grabs everyone who falls under her sway. Joe knows he has to escape. He tries to find happiness with beautiful young Betty Schaefer, with whom he secretly works on a script. But nobody escapes Norma Desmond easily.All in all Sunset Boulevard tells a very sad tale, centered around the quite pitiable Norma Desmond. Norma longs for a world which is forever gone. She won't accept it and nobody will try to make her do so. Max, her only companion before Joe shows up, allows Norma to live in her fantasy world. She retreats so far into her fantasy there is no way back to reality. Norma cannot be saved. She has lost her mind. And despite the fact she does some truly loathsome things you can't help but feel sorry for her. For you saw those moments where the old Norma Desmond shined through, where you could see her for the great star she once was. But those moments are fleeting and ultimately those moments are gone. Only a sad, pathetic shell of Norma Desmond remains. It's a sad journey the character takes, a journey Swanson captures ever so well. You just wish the rest of the film was up to Swanson's standard. Holden can't quite match her. Nancy Olson brings a desperately needed breath of fresh air to the film in playing Betty but the romance between Betty and Joe never fully sparks to life. von Stroheim is memorable in his own way but his character is ultimately almost as sad as Norma. So much sadness in this film. Sunset Boulevard has a captivating story to tell but in the end maybe there is a little too much sadness. And madness. By the end it veers dangerously close to parody. There is much to appreciate about the film but to label it as one of the greatest films ever is to give it more praise than it deserves. It is a good film to be sure. But perhaps upon close examination Sunset Boulevard is not quite ready for its closeup."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 28, 2023",10/10,"Down on his luck writer Joe Gillis is desperate for cash, one day he breaks down outside the home of reclusive silent actress Norma Desmonde, who quickly moves him in, and imagines returning to Hollw8.My first time watching it, and I was engrossed from start to finish, it's a fascinating film, the storyline crosses several different genres, it's somehow a blend of psychological thriller and horror. You know the conclusion before the film even gets going, the rest of the film is focused on Joe Gillie's journey.No wonder this film has such an illustrious reputation, it really is a captivating watch. It's haunting, it's a bleak reminder that not every Hollywood career was stars and Oscars, some careers ended up on the scrap heap.Gloria Swanson delivers an outstanding performance, she should have won The Oscar for it, those eyes and facial expressions, she's fabulous, I loved that Charlie Chaplin sequence. William Holden is equally terrific, I'd say the same applies, Oscar worthy.The acting is of course, wonderful, but it's also immaculately produced, it's very well presented, and moves along very quickly, it defies its age, made all the way back in 1950.10/10."
moonspinner55,"Aug 28, 2005",7/10,"Hack screenwriter chances upon mansion of a faded Hollywood silent screen star who 'hires' him to ghost-write her return project ""Salome"", but who really wants him for her lover. Poor Norma Desmond: she's 50 years old and over the hill! Literate, but queasy black comedy has a great script and majestic performances, but creeps its way to the depressingly inevitable. The palpable aroma of vintage cigarettes and the smell of rosy perfume hanging in the air permeates this incredible Billy Wilder film; yet, the deeper it crawls into its dark corner, the more repulsive it all seems. It can easily be called a masterpiece, but is it an entertaining movie? Great to see Hollywood circa 1950, with Schwab's Drug Store still there, but it's sad to think that even in 1950, stars were being discarded, replaced by the new and the younger, and even a star like Norma Desmond couldn't get a picture made. Thank goodness she had those oil wells in Bakersfield (""Pumping...pumping.""). There's a lesson to be learned from the film: invest! *** from ****"
elsajansson9,"Feb 8, 2015",3/10,"In my opinion Sunset Boulevard was a bland film that left me completely indifferent. The thing I disliked the most about this film was the character development. Joe along with the rest of the characters were two dimensional and flat. The acting by Gloria Swanson was distasteful and overdone which made the film more of a soup opera with an uninteresting story line. I had high expectations after watching Wilder's some like it hot but after watching Sunset Boulevard I was not impressed. In the films defense I am not a big film noir person, I would much rather watch a psychological thriller like Psycho or The Talented Mr Ripley. In conclusion the three words that would best describe this film would be obvious, long, and overdone. I definitely think this film is an acquired taste."
tostinati,"Sep 16, 2001",N/A,"Every time I go to L.A., which isn't too often, I look at these palm-bemused, once smart stucco facades, and wonder if a Norma Desmond from a later era might be hiding from the world inside them, buttressed by cable TV (AMC or TCM, no doubt), a poodle named FiFi or Sir Francis, walk-in closets full of leopard-print Capri pants that haven't fit in decades, and a world class liquor cabinet that has seen heads of state under the table on a good night. It is because of Sunset Blvd., for certain, that my mind could ever go there. It is one of the most indelible films you will ever see.This film is great for many reasons, not the least of which is because it is Hollywood's first look back at itself. In the milieu of this film, the silent era is only 22 years behind us. The people left behind by the rush to sound can still palpably TASTE the fame, the accolade, that particular past being not so very dim and distant. The sadness of their lives was real, and at that point in history, all around, if hidden. Way more has been made of the supposed ""savagery"" of this film vis a vis the faded star than I think exists now, or ever did. The often cynical Wilder is deeply in touch with the tragic here, as much as the grotesque."
SeminolePhenom,"Aug 29, 2005",10/10,"Joe Gillis(William Holden)is a Hollywood writer who gets himself caught up revising a script for the comeback of a silent film star named Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson), who is obsessed with her past and suicidal.Forget the chemistry in Casablanca, this movie has the best on screen chemistry of all time! I have always enjoyed film noir, but never really respected it as much as I would have for other movie genres, but Sunset Blvd. changed my mind. I could not find a single thing wrong with this movie. The acting, writing, and plot were all wonderful. The writing, of course, was the snazzy film noir type dialog that can be easily noticeable. The movie included famous lines such as: ""I'm still big, it's the picture that got smaller"" and ""Mr. Demille, I'm ready for my close-up"" The movie was still scary, even now, 55 years later! Overall, this is one of the greatest movies of all time and the best movie of the 50s.I highly recommend this movie."
DennisLittrell,"Jun 12, 1999",10/10,"Joe Gillis, a failed writer played with an efficient cynicism by William Holden, blows out a tire escaping the repo man, limps into the driveway of an old Sunset Blvd mansion to hide, and thus enters a decadent world that traps him like a babe in a sticky womb. In this morality-tale, a la Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, we learn that even an accidental gigolo earns his keep, and then some.The voice-over and frame are appropriately reminiscent of a Forties' radio show, perhaps ""Inner Sanctum"" or ""The Shadow."" The images, from Gloria Swanson's greasy face and spidery fingers, to Eric Von Stroheim's wheezy organ, to the lighted pool with Joe's face down in it, (""This is where you came in"") are indelible.This is a great movie, built on character and story, well-crafted amidst the haunting atmosphere of an ""undead"" Hollywood.

majikstl,"May 21, 2004",10/10,"SUNSET BOULEVARD will always be inextricably linked to ALL ABOUT EVE. They both came out the same year; they both star legendary actresses playing legendary actresses; they both are cynical, sometimes savage in their estimation of show business. And, of course, they are both great films.But they are very different stylistically and philosophically. A primary difference is that EVE is about a survivor. Bette Davis' Margo Channing in EVE accepts, perhaps grudgingly, that change is inevitable. Either she adapts to reality, or she loses all. That is what makes Margo more than just ""a great star, a true star."" Margo's rival, Eve Harrington, may someday end up like BOULEVARD's Norma Desmond, but Margo Channing never will.But if EVE is about life, SUNSET BOULEVARD is about death. Even their titles suggest this: ""Eve"" being the first bearer of life and ""sunset"" being the approaching night. In BOULEVARD, Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is to some extent already dead by the time the film starts, locked away in a haunted house, coming out only for the funeral of her pet monkey. She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of film-making that is long dead and nearly forgotten. Her life, like her career, is based on illusions of life.The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims; that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star, her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures. I don't buy that. The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant, still beautiful, still energetic and eager to make movies. Plus, she is filthy rich. This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice. Indeed, her voice is magnificent; sultry, insinuating and theatrical. I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her, rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad.I don't think we are getting the full story here. Something may have drove Norma mad, but it wasn't talking pictures. Indeed, she may have been unstable all along, but I think there is something in her past that destroyed her, and I suspect that involves Max (Erich von Stroheim). In his ""Great Movies"" essay, Roger Ebert suggests that the love between Norma and Max, her ex-husband/ex-director/butler, is the heart of the story; that it's Max's love of Norma that validates her continued existence. I don't see that. I suspect that Max is less a servant than a caretaker or even a jailer. Max (like Joe Gillis, Norma's erstwhile boytoy) may be trapped in Norma's web, but it is a web of his own making. He appears subservient, but he is the one in control, he perpetuates her delusions and enables her madness. I even suspect that he only allows Joe into the situation because he knows that Joe is weak and no real threat to his power; and that he suspects that it will help placate Norma by feeding her fantasy of a comeback. There is more than adoration that cements the relationship between Max and Norma; perhaps guilt, jealousy, desperation -- who knows? All I know is that it is best kept as a subtext, a part of the film's impenetrable mystery. The less we understand Norma, the more intriguing she is.However, if I were to be so bold as to make one major change in SUNSET BOULEVARD, it would be to replace William Holden as Joe Gillis. I respect Holden as an actor, but his screen persona has always been one of strength and -- if not integrity -- confidence; he is not one who plays vulnerable with any conviction. Plus, he doesn't play the part of Gillis with any gentle shadings. The ""romance"" between Norma and Joe is the least convincing aspect of the film. Joe treats her with barely concealed contempt and a bit of occasional pity, which makes it hard to believe that a self-absorbed diva would even tolerate him, let alone make him the house pet. The role of Joe was originally intended for Montgomery Clift, an actor with a proven ability to appear passive, even as he plays sinister. His work in THE HEIRESS and A PLACE IN THE SUN illustrate this point. I see Joe Gillis, not as a bored hanger-on, but as sycophant who is in awe of Norma, even as he exploits her, and therefore he doesn't realize that he actually is the one who is being used (sort of a younger version of Max). I think Joe should be someone who is cunning, but naive about his own limits, not someone who is already bitter, corrupt and cynical as the story begins.Maybe I am wrong, but I get the feeling that Holden was very uncomfortable playing the part of, well, a mistress, and especially one kept by such an older woman. Perhaps his manhood was threatened and that uneasiness shows. Clift, or an equally rakish young actor like, say, Farley Granger or Robert Wagner, would enliven the story and make the romance with the perpetually needy Norma more credible. I don't think it is enough that the film shows that Norma enjoys manipulating Joe, I think it has to also be implied that to a certain extent Joe loves being manipulated. The relationship is after all a romance and to be credible as long-term there has to be the spark that it is mutually enjoyable. Holden's interpretation that Joe is just doing it for the money just doesn't ring true. While a pairing of the aging diva with an ambitious -- and yes, probably gay -- younger man is practically a show business institution.Yet, even with these reservations, it is undeniable that SUNSET BOULEVARD is quite a film. A little bit Hollywood satire, a little bit moralistic fable and whole lot of Gothic melodrama. And Swanson's just-not-quite over the top performance is mesmerizing. It was assumed that BOULEVARD would revitalize Swanson's career. It didn't. But apparently, it didn't matter to her: she dabbled in acting now and again, when the part amused her, but she had better things to do with her life. Swanson played Norma Desmond, but she lived life as Margo Channing."
telegonus,"Oct 30, 2001",8/10,"Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts.As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral 'moral tale', it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the Selznick-Wellman A Star Is Born, but it does its job better, with pungent dialogue, brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today."
TheLittleSongbird,"Apr 1, 2010",10/10,"After seeing Sunset Boulevard for the first time ever today, I was surprised at how good the film was. While witty, it is savage, dark and original, and is quite simply too good to be missed. The story, while stark, is brilliantly constructed, about a former movie queen haunted by memories of her past greatness, and the script is both canny and knowing, sporting great lines such as ""I am big. It is the pictures that got small"". Billy Wilder, director of Some Like It Hot and Witness for the Prosecution, both of which are hugely enjoyable, directs briskly, and the black and white cinematography, sets and costumes are fabulous. The music score from maestro Franz Waxman is outstanding, haunting, rich yet beautiful as well.Bringing the screenplay and the story to life is the superb casting. William Holden is excellent as doomed writer Joe Gillis, who narrates in flashback from the scene of his death. Gloria Swanson though is a revelation as Norma, not only wholly convincing but also bringing a desperate and somewhat vampiric glamour to the role. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a wonderful film, wholly deserving of its masterpiece status. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
oconnor0930,"Apr 7, 2010",6/10,"""Sunset Blvd"" unfortunately wasn't as exciting for me as I thought it would be after hearing all the hype. Perhaps it is because the premise is either too dated or too cliché. Nowadays, sixty years after the movie was released, we all know the dark side of Hollywood. We know how it eats people up and spits them out. There is something very real about this film noir, but today it is not something new or particularly interesting. However, sixty years ago, this film was probably more intriguing and 'groundbreaking'.I am generally a fan of more character driven movies so I did enjoy that aspect of ""Sunset Blvd"". The movie is well cast and the female lead, Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, is a particularly interesting character is sad to watch because she is a fallen star who fails to grasp reality. The costumes in this movie are notable if you pay attention to them. The sets are also a strong suit.This movie accurately shows just how cruel Hollywood can be. However, this is no revelation to people who watch it for the first time nowadays. You will either greatly applaud it or it will be unappreciated."
christophe92300,"Jan 18, 2014",4/10,"Here is again a huge disappointing « classic » compared to the raving critics it receives.On the form, there is not much to say, it is your typical Billy Wilder movie with a perfect mise-en-scène and photography (very good work on lighting).There is however a lot of criticisms to make about the content because even though the movie tackles quite effectively, with a cutting look, the Hollywood scene, its fallen stars and aspiring artists, the plot is horrendously unimpressive and extremely shallow.This pseudo romance between William Holden whose role is too bland, too unidimensional, and Gloria Swanson who overacts from start to finish, never captivates the viewer because this story lacks coherence and cohesion, not to mention the movie sometimes looks like a thriller, sometimes like a drama, sometimes a romance, it mixes up too much genres without really developing any of them which ultimately serves it badly."
didi-5,"Mar 21, 2004",N/A,"Not a romanticised view of Tinseltown at all, this Billy Wilder movie was more or less ignored on release - the year that All About Eve took all the awards and the kudos.  It is a bitter pill to swallow since it takes a kick at Hollywood's guts and has one of the bleakest endings in the whole of cinema.Joe Gillis, a struggling writer, finds himself in the drive of a Hollywood palazzo when he wants somewhere to hide his car.  The house belongs to Norma Desmond, who 'used to be big' in pictures, and Joe gets drawn to Norma and drawn into her weird world of flickering shadows.The acting honours in this movie go squarely to Gloria Swanson, herself a 'star of yesteryear' as Norma, who is superb as the actress living in the past.  Not that she plays Norma as exclusively tragic(the scene where she impersonates Chaplin is priceless) but perhaps no one could get to grips with the demands of this part better.  William Holden plays Joe, his breakthrough role, and he does the part very well, while Erich von Stroheim plays faded Hollywood director Max von Mayerling (naturally a reflection of himself), and newcomer Nancy Olson plays Betty, a girl too nice to become submerged just yet in dreamland's poison.The script is its moments of OTT-ness, but it is never less than interesting and draws in the viewer to the point when you are with Norma when she visits her old studio and talks of the joy of coming home; you are with Joe and Nancy as they fall in love among the cardboard settings of movie sets; and you are in the hall with Hedda Hopper watching Norma's last descent into madness.The musical version which appeared in the 1990s had the heart and soul of this movie in mind, and was an excellent tribute to it."
RARubin,"Apr 7, 2005",10/10,"Film Noir, as it was filmed in black and white in the late 40's, early 50's is divided into three distinct categories. For the lowbrow, there is the brilliant Detour, so primitive and shot so cheaply, yet delivering a massive result. Then there is The Big Heat with Glenn Ford, a middlebrow film with the dark shadows, tragedy, and cynicism of Noir. Finally, for the highbrows, we have Billy Wilder's finest film, a true landmark dripping with edgy cynicism by a man that lost his parents to the Holocaust.In Sunset Boulevard, William Holden gives his finest performance. Holden is a very likable man and that comes through on the screen no matter which role he performs, but always that All-American persona, that likability leaks to the screen. Part of this quality is his obvious intelligence. As Norma Desmond's kept man, he knows it's wrong, at times it's downright creepy, but he works with Billy Wilder's vision and melds a bizarre group of Hollywood types into an indictment of the industry up to 1950.Are exploitation, money grubbing, and the status quest pertaining only to the early era of Hollywood? I don't think so. Ha, ha, ask Jessica Simpson, Jana Jamison, Michael Jackson, adnauseam.Gloria Swanson is a great actress. She lures Joe Gillis like a black widow spider. Her delirium is a cross between silent movie actress and Betty Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Perhaps Davis got the idea from Gloria's earlier film. Curiously, Betty's 1950 picture All About Eve won the Oscar. It is a fine film, but SB scared the studio heads, indeed horrified them, and the picture was passed over. Anyhow, this was a comeback for Swanson and she went for it. I don't know if she did a lot of work after this film, but it solidified her reputation as a Prima-Donna film actress. Her performance is unforgettable.Also kudos for Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nora's butler, ex-husband, and first director. Stroheim indeed was a fine silent film director and remarkable in Renoir's Grand Illusion. This fellow looks like he was born to wear the Kaiser's helmet.Finally, Nancy Olsen, pulled from obscurity, a college girl from Wisconsin, she is lovely as Holden's inspiration, and love interest. Her wholesomeness certainly contrasted with all the other grubby Hollywood types in the film.I have seen thousand's of films; many are of very high quality. I can't rattle them all off for you, but SB is in the top 25. Think about that!"
Dr. Ed,"Aug 10, 1998",10/10,"My all-time favorite film. Towering performances by Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Erich von Stroheim along with a perfect music score by Franz Waxman and a witty, biting script by Billy Wilder. Swanson's performance may be the single best performance by an actress in any American film--bar none. It certainly ranks with the best work of Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep. Swanson's vocal subtleties, ranging from imperious to coy to crazy are amazing. Because of its performances (Holden was never better), wit and bitingly honest look at Hollywood as a microcosm for the American Dream, this film is Number 1."
Hitchcoc,"Feb 24, 2006",10/10,"I don't know why I'm attracted to this film. It is such a sick presentation of greed and pity. William Holden can't face the music in his life and so he latches on to this over the hill, mentally ill, star of silent movies. He does the gigolo thing. We can only imagine. He can't get off the mark and leave, though he has numerous chances to do so. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond gives the performance of the century. She is vulnerable and evil; she has the power from her wealth to keep Holden in check. Most people who portray these kinds of characters are hard to believe. She is a bundle of eccentricity and believability. And, like a little boy, he can't leave his mother. We get glimpses of his other life which seems glamorous and exciting, but he cannot give up that financial support and sells himself out; unfortunately to the nth degree. Billy Wilder is a skillful director and what he does with the black and white images (this film has to be in black and white) with the Norma Desmond poses and dreariness of her existence, just works so well. Of course, we all know the final scene. She is not to be dismissed to the very end."
Quinoa1984,"Aug 25, 2005",10/10,"I was a little speechless after I first finished watching Sunset Blvd. I had an idea of what to expect, but I didn't expect that a film made over half a century ago would be so sharp, so artistically compelling, and so tragic while still containing a blistering sense of humor. In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire, ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad, but honest nostalgia. Gloria Swanson, the star of the film, plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind, Norma Desmond. There are a handful (how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable, but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else. Even as a kid and knew that line ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille"" was a basic, but dead-on swipe at ego, or at least stardom. That it was in this context makes it all the more comic/tragic. That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America.The story starts with our protagonist and past-tense narrator, Joe Gillis, who is a struggling B movie screenwriter in Hollywood. Fate, or maybe just odd luck, pits him into the driveway of a big, almost archaic estate that almost looks haunted to him on first sight. He meets Norma Desmond, whom he doesn't recognize as once being a big silent movie star. ""I am big,"" she says in one of her trademark lines, ""it's the pictures that have gotten small."" She confides in Gillis, after he tells her who he is and why he's there (hiding out as it were), that she has a screenplay she wants DeMille to direct as her 'comeback'. He very reluctantly agrees to do it, and very soon gets sucked up into her world, becoming disconnected to his small circle of Hollywood friends. But he still has one, as a kind of secret almost, Betty Schaefer (the beautiful Nancy Olson), who is an aspiring screenwriter. One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on, but like with Wilder's other great films, the unexpected moments and keen revelations/coincidences are the best parts; Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's 'butler', is surprisingly good.I've seen Sunset Blvd. several times now, but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around; I wondered why it was even considered in the 'film-noir' tradition (not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings, but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up). I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy, with Norma Desmond as the delusional, self-fulfilling has-been. For example, when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey- it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it, but also as they bury it Gillis' wry narration. The narration in this film is another great trademark, with that kind of snappy later 40's/early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films. And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs, in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio, and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head.In repeated viewings, the film does show itself as darker, with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters. Not just Norma, but also Joe, who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator. The final scenes, which link up to the ""end scene at the beginning"", and then the sort of crazy, classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase, more of the film-noir elements come through. The 'average Joe', so to speak, in over his head; the sinister elements that are around him (more so here psychological than criminal); and of course the 'black widow' in Norma Desmong. Swanson, in what should've been her Oscar winning role, never misses a beat. Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days (another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films), there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character.And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant, as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel, and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing. The relationships, like the one between Joe and Betty, is handled gently, so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact. Max, as well, is maybe even more a complex character than Norma; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp? Perhaps he is too. Maybe that's one, perhaps subtle, message to the film- as much as it is fascinating to look to the past, to get locked into it is something very detrimental. But the film may not have a very clear-cut message, as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people (like a Kubrick film)- it's funny, it's romantic, it's sly, and at times very weird. I can't wait to see it again."
Lechuguilla,"Feb 7, 2011",10/10,"With the spotlight on Norma Desmond, one of the greatest movie characters of all time, played majestically by Gloria Swanson, ""Sunset Blvd."" oozes Hollywood Gothic, in a story that is as bleak as it is timeless.Although the script's protagonist is Joe Gillis (William Holden), unsuccessful screenwriter and opportunist, the heart and soul of the film resides in the character of older woman Norma Desmond, a reclusive movie star of years gone by, living in the past, vain, egocentric, yearning for a return to the camera.What makes Norma so memorable is her singular strangeness ... those over-sized hand gestures, eyes bugged-out, ghastly makeup, grandiose emotions, and living with her servant Max (Erich von Stroheim) in that overblown, creepy mansion, antiquated, baroque, and "" ... out of beat with the rest of the world, crumbling apart in slow motion."" Norma and her world are bleak beyond words. And yet, there's a humor in all that bombastic eccentricity.And the film's theme runs deep, as it turns on its industry overlords with a stinging indictment of Hollywood suits, cruel and heartless, spitting out actors and writers when they no longer generate money. Hollywood insiders are portrayed thusly as desperate, vain, egocentric, opportunistic, shallow, and delusional, much like Norma and Joe. Indeed, the Hollywood savagery of 1950 looks very much like the Hollywood savagery of today. Thematically, the film has not aged at all.B&W cinematography captures the story's bleakness well. Sets and props are suitably specific and detailed. The film's score is at times as grandiose and majestic as Norma. And Wilder's stylistic and flamboyant directorial flourishes add to the film's supremacy.My only complaint pertains to the script. The voice-over narration is a bit overdone. And the second half plot gives a little too much attention to the Betty Schaefer character. It's Norma Desmond that I want to see and listen to.These quibbles aside, ""Sunset Blvd."" is one of the great classic films of all time, a noir drama, wonderfully dreary and grim, yet funny, too. And that final sequence with Norma descending the staircase, addressing those around her in a mannered whisper, head tilted back, all bug-eyed and never blinking ... then as she looks into the camera ... Just terrific!"
BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Oct 2, 2006",6/10,"A screenwriter who seems to have lost his knack and fallen into money problems winds up in an old movie star's home while running from debt collectors. She then gets him to write what is to be her tour-de-force comeback into the Hollywood spotlight. But things are not quite so simple...This is really one of those films that has aged. Meaning, some people will appreciate it, but others will find it hell to sit through. Painfully slow at times and just plain old aged it really takes a good understanding that this is an older film to appreciate it. The central message - a look at the Hollywood film making system, which caused loads of controversy at the time of initial release - remains interesting, especially for movie enthusiasts and film makers, but if you are just looking for a good classic thriller from director Billy Wilder, ""Double Indemnity"" would be a safer choice.After the intriguing opening, many of the scenes in the center film drag on and the atmosphere is much less than desired from what you'd expect from such a film. And that overall makes it not very engaging, though in parts, it remains poignant and is overall daring for a studio produced picture. 6/10Not Rated - has a scene of violence (not graphic) and some mature themes."
filmnoairarchivefilm,"Jul 7, 2025",10/10,"I saw Sunset Boulevard on the big screen and it was mesmerizing. The dark and elegant atmosphere, Gloria Swanson's incredible performance hit even harder in a cinema. The black and white visuals felt timeless and the score added tragic grandeur. Watching Norma Desmond descend into madness, larger than life, was chilling!It's not just a film about Hollywood, it's a ghost story wrapped in glamour and decay.A true classic that still stuns in every frame!The cinematography was breathtaking! The use of deep shadows, stark contrasts and dramatic lighting creates a noir atmosphere that perfectly matches the film's dark tone. Every frame feels carefully composed.Norma Desmond's mansion was shot like a gothic tomb, full of decay and faded grandeur.The camera highlighs both beauty and ruin. It's visual storytelling at its most haunting and poetic."

It oozes class and the performances are all first class.Wilder once again proves why he's one of the top 5 directors of all time. Catch all his work if you can."
siderite,"Sep 21, 2023",10/10,"It all starts with the jaded male narrator explaining what goes on while also playing the part, all black and white, the very definition of a film noir. The main character is a screenwriter down on his luck, three months late on paying rent and the rates to the car and contemplating returning (Oh no!) from glamorous L. A. to Ohio. But then he stumbles onto something and his life changes. The rest of the film is a satirical overview of Hollywood as it was changing from its golden years to the modern '50s. Of course, that scene has been done to death since, right?The acting is what makes this film great, but also the sets, the mood, the direction, the subtle hints and not so subtle hints to actual people and events and situations. People adored Wilder for his critique of Hollywood and other people hated him, taking the entire plot of the film very personally. After all, it is a film about the way the movie industry destroys people, by seducing and then trapping them into a soulless and empty existence.Gloria Swanson is just magnificent in a role rejected by other actresses for vanity reasons. Ironically, her career was practically ended by it since everyone wanted to cast her into the same role again and again. William Holden is also perfect for his role, but Erich von Stroheim steals the show by playing a role very close to his own personal life. It doesn't do it justice for me to go on about it here, but read on about the film and what happened to its cast and what it was based on.I have watched this film 73 years after it came out and it was still great, impactful, relevant, made me feel invested. Perhaps that's more a sign of Hollywood's stagnation than of the timelessness of the movie itself, but both me and the wife watched it in one go and couldn't find a flaw with it. Highly recommended."
Primtime,"Mar 10, 1999",8/10,"Not too many films could personify all that is Hollywood quite like this film. This film speaks Hollywood, shows Hollywood, cries Hollywood and dies Hollywood. Billy Wilder tried harder than any of his other film while making this one and it sure shows.The story of the aging film star that still lives in the past was something like a tribute to an era that even in the 50's had long lost its luster. Gloria Swanson in the best role of her career plays Norma Desmond, the silent screen star who is in the process of writing a script for a film to be directed by Cecil B DeMille, or at least she believes so. Norma entails the help of a younger man named Joe Gillis (played by William Holden), who in a bit of desparation of his own, decides to alter her script for her in return for money and a place to live.The haunting mansion that Desmond lives in with only her butler Max (Erich von Stronheim) shows only pictures of her, has a screen onto which her films are shown to her weekly and plays host to other former silent film stars (notably Buster Keaton in a surprise cameo), is a reminder of how time passed Norma by. Norma tries, though in vain to make Joe love her as she loves him. She even goes through the trouble of having a small orchestra play all night on New Year's Eve just for the two of them. When Joe asks when all of the other people are going to arrive, Norma responds ""this is a special evening, this is our evening."" From here on we see to what lengths Norma will go to show Joe how much she loves him, regardless of the fact that he does not love her.Joe is eventually approached by a script reader, Betty, (Nancy Olsen) that finds some potential in one of his older scripts and offers to work with him to bring it up to par. The only problem is the close grip that Norma has around him. Joe knows that he can only sneak away at night since Norma doesn't want him to be away from her for any amount of time. Joe leaves frequently to work with Betty, all the while falling in love with her.The tragic ending in this film reminded me of the one in ""The Great Gadsby."" It is another example of love gone wrong when a man should have been with the girl he loved, however, the circumstances he is in simply won't let him.I fully enjoyed this film and would recommend it to all. This film is truly one of the all time greats.8/10 stars."
x_manicure_x,"Aug 14, 2021",10/10,"""Sunset Boulevard"" has a special place in my heart as one of the first classics that interested me in cinema. It still works great after 70 years as it's a simple, straightforward, but focused film that manages to deal with timeless themes with sarcasm and intelligence without having no arthouse pretentiousness or making no life-changing statements. Video quality aside, there is nothing I would change about it.The characters are iconic thanks to the fact that they are played by actors that actually experienced the dawn of the silent era and the struggles to survive in the ever-changing Hollywood industry. Forgotten silent era diva Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson, who was herself a faded star who lost her job due to the advent of sound films. Her butler and former director Max is played by Erich von Stroheim, who happens to have directed some of Gloria Swanson's classics (one of them gets even projected in Norma's living room). Director Cecil DeMille plays himself, and other silent era actors and old Hollywood personalities like Buster Keaton also have cameos.I also loved how, in the end, none of the characters is really positive. Norma and Max are self-delusional and unable to accept that the world around them has changed, they would do anything to prevent their dream from falling apart. Joe and Betty represent the ""young"" Hollywood, but they are blinded by their ambition and egoism to the point they both chose to embark on a clandestine affair, even though they owe everything to their partners.First-person narration by the already dead protagonist Joe Gillis makes the film even more fascinating. Gillis is a talentless but arrogant screenwriter who succumbed to Hollywood's trap of fame, and it feels almost ironic that ""Sunset Boulevard"" could have been the first successful screenplay in his career.The dialogues tend to be over the top at times, but they perfectly suit Norma's character and lifestyle. Gillis' cynical tone in the narration, combined with the awareness of his tragic fate, also manages to make us understand that we are not dealing with the usual melodramatic sentimentality of Hollywood."
fercastro,"Feb 11, 2002",10/10,"A wonderful,marvelous, out-of-this-world picture. It is crude with Hollywood, but it is also a declaration of love to the movies, and all that they represent. Gloria Swanson is at the top of her career as one of the most bigger-than-life characters of the movies. And William Holden delivers his best performance as the gigolo-to-be Gillis. But the movie belongs, ultimately, to Erich Von Stroheim, the master of his art that was the influence on Wilder here. Wilder said he had ideas of himself for the movie, such as a scene in which he would wash Norma Desmond's underwear with romantic frenzy. Talk about screen rebels..."
AaronCapenBanner,"Nov 2, 2013",7/10,"Billy Wilder directed this dark comedy/drama that stars William Holden as hack writer Joe Gillis, desperate for work who agrees to see former silent movie queen Norma Desmond(played by Gloria Swanson) who has dreams of a big comeback in a picture directed by Cecil B. Demille,and wants Joe to write it, but in reality has become a delusional, even insane woman who lives in a self-contained world in her Hollywood home with her butler,and former director & husband, Max(played by Erich Von Stroheim) who remains steadfastly loyal. Joe and Norma start a relationship(she is still wealthy) but her jealousies grow out of hand leading to the inevitable outcome... Nancy Olsen and Jack Webb play Joe's concerned friends. Legendary film has many interesting and accurate things to say about that self-contained world called Hollywood, though only quibble is that this film is a little too out there, to the point it affects credibility by becoming a self-parody. Still, a witty and memorable film regardless."
adventure-21903,"Nov 9, 2019",10/10,"Billy Wilder, Director of Sunset Boulevard cast Gloria Swanson of Queen of the silent movies in this return project after Mae West and other great stars turned down the role. Lucky are we that Swanson was cast. Gloria rSwanson gives one of the greatest performances ever on film as the silent screen star Norma Desmond. It is inexplicable that Swanson did not win the Academy award the only way you can rationalize it is that she had been away from films for many years and the Academy didn't know Swanson. Bette Davis gave a great performance in All About Eve as did her costar Anne Baxter (the more I see All About Eve the more I appreciate Baxter's performance) Eleanor Parker was brilliant in Caged. But Judy Holliday was magic in Born Yesterday. It was a year of great performances.I repeat Gloria Swanson should have won the Academy Award.William Holden the perfect male leading man gives a great performance in Sunset Boulevard as does Nancy Olson and a supporting cast of great players but is Swanson who grabs your attention and never lets it go.The finale of this movie is one of the great finales of all time. Billy Wilder was a genius."
B-Seide24,"May 4, 2010",7/10,"I Thought that overall sunset blvd was a good movie. I did find it very hard to deal with Gloria Swanson even though she played a magnificent role and casting her was perfect for the role she had. You could tell she was a silence film actress because you could see how she used expressions and looks to portray just how she was feeling or dealing with things. This is what made it very hard for me to deal with this women. I felt the director did appropriate job of selecting a cast that met the demands of the movie including Nancy Olsen who plays the woman who gets William Holdens mojo for writing back. The score and dark ominous lighting did a amazing job of portraying just how dark a road William holden's character was moving down the line and just how far and extreme it might get to escape it. This is why the beginning scene which happens to be the last scene sets off a great example of what can happen in life if you just accept things and let people start to run your life. Wiliam Holden knew there was no escaping the dark, scary tones of what Gloria Swanson's life had become because without her he truly had nothing. Overall, this movie was brilliant and strange while keeping you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen to ""Joe Gillis"" next."
moonmonday,"May 3, 2015",3/10,"It was okay.Gloria Swanson stole every scene she was in, and her expressive slightly overacting perfectly reflected her character, a performer from an age where vivid facial emotion was crucial in the absence of spoken dialogue. Eric von Stroheim plays an understated role and provides a strong, often silent presence. And William Holden is pretty, but not much else.Honestly, the only person who is remotely sympathetic or identifiable is Swanson's character of Norma Desmond, and the rest are fairly awful, aside from Stroheim's Max, who is basically very interesting scenery; I was pretty sad to reach the end and feel that everyone had basically come away with more or less just desserts. Holden's character was especially difficult to like and seemed to choose, at any given time, the worst and most idiotic possible choice of action.Was this Wilder's attempt at self-parody? Some parts of it would seem to be more satirical than serious, and the whole thing was entirely over the top. It could work as a Gothic tongue-in- cheek work, something like the Addams Family meets the silent age of film, which had aged past its prime.Perhaps it's just that the premise and the characters that populate it cannot really be seen the way they might have been in 1951. Desmond and Max's pathos and need for love and companionship juxtaposed with their isolation in a decaying yet still darkly splendid palace cannot fail to draw sympathy and interest. But Holden's Joe is just a stupid schmuck with a pretty face who never does anything right and was a poor choice for a protagonist.Ultimately it's hard to feel anything for him, though part of that may be the truly asinine choice to begin a film knowing your protagonist is...well, see for yourself. Or don't. It's good for a watch. I don't think I'll ever need to see it again."
JSanicki,"Feb 11, 2003",N/A,"From the very beginning of this film, with the external shot of the corpse floating in the outdoor pool, the audience gets sucked in.  Sunset Boulevard is a fantastic example of artistry gone horribly wrong and selling yourself out for the betterment of yourself.  All four main characters, Norma, Joe, Max and Betty are definite characterizations of four different types of person in Hollywood. Norma is of course the faded silent screen star so desperate upon making a comeback that in essence it just kills her and everyone around her.  Joe is the down and out, very desperate screenwriter who stumbles upon Norma and falls head first under her spell.  By the time he gets sucked into her web, it is almost madness as to why he cannot extricate himself from her grip.  Max is the humble butler, who unlike so many other people has come crawling back to Norma because he simply cannot live without her.  So, in essence he takes a menial job just to continue to stay with her in one form or another.  Betty is the one ray of sunlight in an otherwise dark and foreboding world that threatens to crush anyone that gets ensnared in it for too long (i. e. the Hollywood system).  But even so, her light is almost snuffed out towards the end of the film.  We never really get to see what happens to her afterwards.I think what makes this film so great is its ability to wear its heart upon its sleeve.  It is an unflinching portrait of what Hollywood once was (and is no longer) but some of the vestiges from this film can still be seen today.  The bitterness and the knife-edge cynicism (not to mention the acting) is what, I think, draws so many people back to it for repeated viewings, myself included.  For even if we've seen this film before, we can always see it again and pick up on certain things that we never noticed the first time around.  For example, the home that the filmmakers used as Norma's mansion was also used a few years later in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without A Cause.Gloria Swanson gives a heart-rending performance as Norma Desmond, the silent screen star so desperate to make a comeback.  This film was sort of a ""comeback"" for her, having been out of the public eye since the early thirties.  She albeit succeeded but however, she failed to win the coveted Best Actress award at the Oscars that year (1951).  The prize even eluded both Bette Davis and Anne Baxter from All About Eve and went to newcomer Judy Holliday as ditzy blonde Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday.  Frankly, putting both Swanson and Davis in the same category, I have to say that Bette Davis did actually give the better performance that year, but Swanson's Norma is still a character and a force to be reckoned with!Sunset Boulevard lost out to All About Eve, the Hollywood masterpiece about the Broadway stage, at the Oscars that year.  Hollywood wasn't ready to award itself because some people didn't care for the way that the film was portraying itself (showing the dark, seamy side).  I, however, still love this film and will always love this film because I think it shows Wilder at his most perfect, most distinctive period in his life.This is a true classic.  Get this one on DVD as soon as you can!My rating: 4 stars."
mmallon4,"Mar 27, 2015",10/10,"Despite Louis B. Mayer's comments to Billy Wilder that ""You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you!"" - I feel Sunset Boulevard enhanced the Hollywood mythos. Who knows what Norma Desmonds may have existed; crazed celebrity lunatics living in their run-down ghostly mansions in the Hollywood area, not just back then but in the decades which have followed. However, the film also makes you feel sentimental for the silent era, that something really was lost when Hollywood made the transition to sound.Gloria Swanson's role as Norma Desmond is my favourite female performance of all time. Overblown, over the top, flamboyant, fantastic! A performance which could have been unintentionally comical (ala John Barrymore's Oscar Jaffe) but her insanity can be taken completely seriously; same goes for her butler Maxilillian played by Erich von Stroheim. In many ways she is that character, as Gloria Swanson has even said so herself; just looks at her reactions to watching her own pictures. Desmond is a character whose relevance for the modern world has not been lost, in an age when people are obsessed with celebrity, youth, and beauty more than ever. Likewise, Cecil B. deMille's performance feels entirely genuine, as if two old friends have just met for the first time in years.I also find the dynamic shared between William Holden and Gloria Swanson to be of fascination; an older woman seducing a much younger man who eventually gives into her when in classic Hollywood films it was often the other way around. It's clear from their actions as the film progresses the two characters are likely sleeping with each other, such as Joe happily flaunting his shirtless body in front of Norma by the poolside and she even starts drying him with a towel; there is a bit of Mrs. Robinson to her.Sunset Boulevard is possibly the most quotable film of its genre, although none its lines have become as famous in the pop culture lexicon as a film like say Casablanca, in which everyone knows its famous quotes whether or not they've seen the film or are even interested in classic cinema. Yet among circles of classic Hollywood fans, Sunset Boulevard is one of the most widely quoted films in discussions. Joe Gillis (William Holden) narrates the film despite his character being dead but it still works in an otherworldly way, like he's narrating from the afterlife. Holden holds an ideal narration voice to showcase Billy Wilder's ability to turn exposition into poetry. Likewise, Buster Keaton's appearance may be my favourite celebrity film cameo ever; there's something about his reaction when playing poker (""pass!"").For as cynical a film as Sunset Boulevard is, ultimately it is a movie for movie lovers. Particularly the scene in which Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) tells Joe Gillis of how there is no shame working behind the camera while walking through the empty back stages of Paramount Studios at night as she tells him about her childhood spending time on studio back lots, is very life-affirming. It's such a beautiful and romantic scene; it's easy why these two were paired in several films together. Olson's character is the opposite of Norma Desmond, humble and down to Earth, not concerned with her looks or fame and fortune; and unlike Norma she can actually write movie scripts.Say goodbye to Hollywood, say goodbye my baby."
alphaspace,"Aug 16, 2001",10/10,"This was the best of Gloria Swanson ever.  Sunset Blvd was the best dark comedy meets real life picture I have ever seen bar none.  Norma Desmond aging has been actress long lost from the modern stage sits going ever so quietly insane in a huge mansion that serves as here self imposed creaking prison complex.  Surrounded by lavish furnishings in a one time architecturally masterful home that while still unique and beautiful are now aged crumbling threadbare relics of a bygone era much as is their mistress. Poor dear Norma has but one fan left an equally pathetic hanger on.  A man in name only who clings to aging film star Norma Desmond hoping his acting career gets a much needed jump start.  They both use each other much the way a Remora clings near the mouth of a shark in hopes of enjoying bits of food that steam past as the shark feeds.  Norma whose star has long ago cooled into a pile of solid iron covering an even colder neutronium core has no life giving food to share with her mercenary paramour.  So both Norma Desmond and, her toy boy do what all parasites in co-dependant relationships do eventually.... They feed off each other and, last one left standing in this case gets an imaginary close up taken by non-existent camera's as crowds of adoring fans cheer if only between Norma's ears.  Her savvy bo has taken a dip in the pool which he entered as he did the relationship with Norma eyes wide open blinded by his lust to what she was.This was an awesome story quite ahead of its time.  Brutally funny but real and eerie.  This one makes you think even when you do not want to. There is a little Norma Desmond in us all.  The want of things out of reach that lust to have just a little more time in the sun before our inevitable twilight engulfs us.  Life for Norma Desmond is a shroud that only she does not see she is wearing it.This is a must own DVD or video get the DVD when it becomes available."
Aditya_Gokhale,"Mar 3, 2006",10/10,"""Sunset Blvd."" is a film that you cannot possibly miss! It has got to be one of the darkest movies I have ever seen. And to think it came out in the 50s.....It is the story of a lonesome actress of the Silent movie era, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot come to terms with the fact that her days of glory are long gone....In such a scenario, a series of events lead to her meeting a young screen-writer by the name of Joe Gillis (William Holden). What follows is a tragic tale of madness....a tale which will show that Hollywood is not always the rosy picture it is made out to be!The film is brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder. Hats off to Gloria Swanson for her extraordinary performance as Norma Desmond. She totally rules the screen throughout the movie! William Holden is great as Joe Gillis. Also, equally good is Erich Von Stroheim in a supporting role.Most people may just ignore this film on face value, since it is Black and White and was released in 1950. But I would like to state here, that just this once, at least for this film, make an exception. Rent this movie or just buy the DVD. It's very well worth it.10/10."
joshuafagan-64214,"Oct 12, 2015",10/10,"First off, read that name a few times. Then a few more. 'Sunset Boulevard.' Does that not just send shivers up your spine? Yes, I am well aware that it is the title of the famous street in Los Angeles in which the film takes place. But it seems more... invocative than just that. If such is pure coincidence, then it is a coincidence that makes a great film even better. But i don't think it was. Knowing the quality of this film, I think that it was meant to invoke deeper feelings in the viewer than just 'oh, that's the name of a street in Los Angeles.' When the film begins, we are greeted with a flash-forward to the end of the movie. I always love it when films or books do this. Surprise is sometimes good, but it is often overrated. Once enough time is out, everyone knows your secret. So there is certainly something to be said for just revealing what happens at the end of the film and launching into an elucidation of how such came to be.We are also greeted with an opening narration. From that moment onwards, this film had me. Not because I am just a sucker for opening narrations (though I am). But because it is just so good. And I say that as a novelist. Truly, it is one of the best openings narrations I've seen or heard, in literature or film or any other medium. With one fell swoop, it sets the tone of film, establishes intrigue and tension, and messages your brain and heart.The style of this film is excellent. Every decision is conscious and It also establishes the fact that this film takes heavily from film noirs. I don't think I would quite consider it a noir on its own night. But it certainly was made by someone who not only loves film noir, but knows how to make use of it, and what it adds to a film. As a lover of noir myself, I will always support that.purposeful, advancing the fabric of the tightly woven story. But style isn't everything. Which makes it a good thing that this film succeeds on grounds of substance as well. It should tell you something that the first work that came to mind as I watched this was The Great Gatsby. It's not a perfect comparison, of course, but it does manage to invoke some of the same complex feelings.There are so many themes at play here that I could be up here until midnight three days from now and still not have covered everything. But you don't need to fully unravel them; for mood and story's sake, it is enough to know that they are there, that they are present and will keep being so. It's like you're a kid watching a complex work for the first time; you may not know every intricacy that is on display, but you nonetheless are comforted by their presences.At its core, this film is about a young, out of work, broke scriptwriter who is just ready to give up on the Hollywood Dream and head back to Ohio when he is confronted with a grand mansion that is owned by an Old Hollywood fading star who invites him in. She sends him to work on her overblown, worthlessly-written screenplay that she thinks will make her a star once more. For this and above all else, for comfort, she persuades him to stay with her. Having no other place to go, the young writer agrees. For a while, he lives the high life. he even gets an expensive suit. But when he wants to leave, she gets clingy and... things get interesting.It gives off the feeling that he is being pulled deeper and deeper into a spider's web. But, in a bit of a twist, the spider does not want to kill him. Yes, she is delusional and insane and dangerous to herself and others. But she has no vile or inherently malicious bones in her body. She is just, at her heart, a lonely and insecure person who is caught up in yearning for past glories, who makes herself feel far older than she really is. The young man has a great quote about this that is both fitting in context and translatable out of it. It goes like this: There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25. Simple. Concise. And flush with enough resonance to fill up a twenty-mile long crater.If you could take away only thing from this film, let it be that realism is not always needed to make a movie pierce on a real and scathing level. This film is heightened and almost reminiscent of a nightmare. But it is the best Hollywood does Hollywood movie ever and the most definitive.See you on Sunset Boulevard."
Fellani,"Sep 27, 2001",10/10,"Usually, when I watch classics from the early part of the century, I can usually appreciate the historical values and innovations in those movies, but they don't usually blow me away like Sunset Boulevard did. I was speechless for most of the movie and the ending, although I knew about it, still amazed me.Everything is perfect in this movie: direction, script, scenario, photography and the acting. That movie and Double Indemnity really made me appreciate the genius of Billy Wilder.One of my top ten movies of all time.10/10"

The idea that people played by the actors today do still exist today isn't so far fetch.I think the acting was on point. People picked up upon the highs and lows of the characters they played.Sometimes we wonder if life is imitating art or is art imitating life. With the way the world is today, there are some movies like this when you really do wonder what the basis is.Things in Hollywood were hush hush back then, I guess we'll never know."
botavuan,"Dec 9, 2022",3/10,"I was finally induced to watch this film after reading favourable remarks on it in one of Simon Callow's memoirs. I didn't have high hopes, so they weren't dashed when I watched.Like almost all Hollywood films, it was form without substance - slight, bland and superficial. I thought the acting atrociously over the top; in fact the only good acting came from Cecil B. DeMille, playing himself. There was the usual excess of alcohol laced with lame wise-cracks which pass for humour in American cinema. There was almost no plot, no depth of character, The unappealing William Holden was evidently taken off the shelf for his role, and Gloria Swanson was merely grotesque."
csdietrich,"Feb 23, 2001",10/10,"SUNSET BOULEVARD, this writer's favorite American film and an ageless, deathless and eternal classic about Hollywood and the victims of fame and unrequited love. Gloria Swanson's bravura moment, the bravest role of her career, is positively mesmerizing. The script crackles with brilliance in every line (so many unforgettable statements and remarks about the star system) that it packs a whallop as no other film can or ever has. William Holden is perfectly cast as the definitive writer-turned-gigolo (the role was originally meant for Montgomery Clift) and Erich Von Stroheim gives yet another star turn as her manservant, Max. There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to convey the power and dark poetry of this quintessential cinematic classic. Franz Waxman provides one of his greatest scores here. The injustice of the time was that ALL ABOUT EVE stole nearly every Oscar this film deserved to have, but clearly illustrates what sour grapes  Hollywood's elite felt after this movie hit the screens!"
LeonLouisRicci,"Dec 16, 2013",10/10,"Most Film Buffs and Critics Love this Movie. Because it's a Great one about The Movies.

Sybee,"Jun 13, 2004",10/10,"I just saw Sunset Blvd. for the first time as it was aired on finish channel two. I was amazed! Totally brilliant! Billy Wilder is a superb director and William Holden a terrific actor. And the plot. Very good indeed. As a whole the movie is a perfect combination. Actors, screenplay, music and all key elements are all very close to the best I've ever seen on film. I can on only wonder about the imagination of Billy Wilder. Of course I have give credit to the other writer Charles Brackett as well. And Gloria Swanson plays the neurotic and psychotic has-been movie star with so much authenticity that it is quite scary. What more can I say? Probably quite a lot, but I'll just end by saying that Sunset Blvd. is in my opinion one of the greatest movies ever."
Prince-P,"Dec 17, 2023",7/10,"Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered one of the most biting satires of classic Hollywood. A cruel tale of the capriciousness of movie fandom. In his mockery of the industry's sordidness, Wilder turns the history of Tinseltown inside out. He tells a story where a former silent star plays an aging movie diva. Her butler is portrayed by ""The Man You Love to Hate"" - Erich von Stroheim. And yet Billy Wilder himself hadn't come to America until he was almost 30 years old.The director was born in 1906, in the small village of Sucha, Austria-Hungary. When Billy Wilder was 20 he moved to Berlin where he began working as a screenwriter. After the Nazi Party's rise to power, he fled to the United States. There, Wilder finally ended up in Hollywood where he could continue his career in film. In 1939 Wilder had his first success with ""Ninotchka"", a collaboration with fellow German immigrant Ernst Lubitsch. Swedish superstar Greta Garbo appeared in the lead, which, by the way, was her first role in a romantic comedy.""Sunset Boulevard"" began life as a comedy. As work progressed, however, the script became more melodramatic than funny. Wilder first offered the main role to Greta Garbo. When she declined, he turned to Gloria Swanson instead. Then, Montgomery Clift was approached for the male lead, but he wasn't interested. According to him, the notion of an innocent young man being kept by a 60-year-old woman was downright disgusting. The part eventually went to William Holden.Hardly surprising, ""Sunset Boulevard"" became the most anticipated film of the year. The magazine ""Newsweek"" even put Gloria Swanson on its cover before the release. And William Holden's performance reignited his, at the time, dwindling stardom. So, even if the movie was offending Hollywood's powerful moguls, ""Sunset Boulevard"" was rewarded with 11 Academy Award nominations. Billy Wilder himself took home one of them for having written the screenplay."
Katherina_Minola,"Dec 4, 2013",10/10,"You know when occasionally you watch a film, and you think it sounds okay, but then it totally exceeds your expectations and you're just blown away by it? Well, Sunset Boulevard (aka Sunset Blvd.) was just such a film for me.William Holden – who also narrates the film – plays Joe Gillis, a small-time screen writer, down on both money and luck; as we find out right at the beginning of the film, Gillis won't be alive by the end of it. He meets former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot and will not accept the truth that her star has long since faded into obscurity and she has been all but forgotten by both the film industry, and movie-goers. Determined to have another hit film, she hires Joe to help her edit her self-penned script, but she soon becomes obsessed with him, and Joe finds himself less a guest, more a prisoner, at her dilapidated home, with only Norma and her mysterious butler Max for company.As you may have guessed, I loved this film. The storyline is a caustic and witty dig at a fickle Hollywood. The fact that viewers are informed by Joe's voice-over right at the start of the film, that he will not survive to the end, fills the ensuing scenes with a bitter sense of doom, and the contrast between Joe the narrator, who knows his fate, and Joe the character who we see on camera, who is unaware of what will befall him, is very effective (A similar idea was used years later in American Beauty, also with excellent results, although Sunset Boulevard was, for me, a much better film.)Gloria Swanson was excellent as Norma Desmond, and at times was difficult to watch. I disliked her character, but couldn't help feeling great sympathy for her. Deserted by her fans and her colleagues, she is losing her grip on reality. At times, she was manic and unpredictable; at other times, she showed tenderness and extreme vulnerability (the scene where she entertains Joe by dressing up as Charlie Chaplin is both sweet and disturbing, as her happy mood turns to anger). Swanson was nominated for an Oscar for her performance; the same year Bette Davis was nominated for her role in All About Eve – both lost out to Judy Holliday for her role in Born Yesterday, which also starred William Holden. He was also nominated for Sunset Boulevard.William Holden shows his real talent for acting here. A not altogether likable character at the beginning of the film, he nevertheless gets the audience on side, as he and they come to realise the untenable situation in which he has found himself. He imbues his character with passion, tenderness, ruthlessness, and resignation – oh, and he's darkly funny too.Eric von Stroheim is perfectly cast as Norma's taciturn and mysterious butler – this role could easily have been a caricature in different hands, but he plays the part brilliantly.The main cast is rounded out by Nancy Olsen as Betty Schaefer, a young writer who wants Joe's help on a script; she is perfectly cast as a feisty but tender young woman who is dragged into Joe's nightmare world.In short, my opinion for what it's worth, is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's gripping – I felt unable to turn my eyes away from the screen; it's sad, it's tragic, and it's bleakly funny. It was a real victory for director Billy Wilder, and it's the best film I've seen in a long time. Very highly recommended."
timothywalton-31924,"Jun 3, 2023",7/10,"Someone will have my head for giving Billy Wilders Sunset Boulevard, arguably his magnum opus, a mere 7 out of 10. But perhaps that proves that movies are oh so subjective, and nobody should claim to be the high priest on what is good or bad.Which is not to say I didn't enjoy sunset boulevard. The film is bleak, and scathingly so. It is an unflinchingly brutal look at Hollywood and the star system. Nora Desmond was an actress whose star has faded, but propped up by egotistical delusions and the machinations of a loyal butler, she continues to think herself more important than she is. Joe Gillis is the young, troubled screenwriter who enters her life, first as a friendly companion, then as her kept man. In the end when he leaves, Desmond murders him, and becomes an unhinged lunatics so absorbed into her own delusions of power that she literally sees nothing else.It is doubtless, an extremely dark story, told to perfection by Wilder. It is unflinching and penetrating, questioning hollywoods star system, wherein actors can become so absorbed that they do not come to terms with the world outside. It also questions the simultaneous zealousness and callousness, then capriciousness of fans. Fans are not privy to their idols' personal or deepest lives- they form this passion for their idol from their public persona, which inevitably corrupts the idol who cannot separate her private and public life. Then the whimsy and capriciousness of fans means stars will lose their shine, as in Desmonds' case. The film may also be a critique of the star system Hollywood put through many young actors and actresses, where teenagers barely 16 become absorbed into the system, and they hence do not have the requires space to develop emotionally and mentally in the ordinary coming of age. We see this most notably in Judy Garlands case, who was thrust into the limelight as a child star, and hence could never develop the manual fortitude or emotional stability due to abuse by the studio bosses. The film also hints that Desmond, discovered by Max at the young age of 16, suffers a similar fate, except she is continually led to believe that she star hasn't faded by Max, and as a result lacks the mental strength to face the truth.The film is also acted exquisitely by Gloria Swanson, who gives a bravura performance as Desmond. She is at first, authoritative and commanding, befitting her supposed celebrity status. Then she breaks down because of various delusions, whether about Joe, or about the imaginary film she would soon be shooting. In the end, Desmond becomes an unhinged lunatic, totally incapable of perceiving, let alone accepting reality. William Holden also turns in a good performance as the kept man, a man stripped of all manhood in this male dominant world, a man who is frustrated yet cannot bear to leave his comfortable surroundings.While sunset boulevard is definitely full of memorable performances and rich insight into Hollywood, it sorely lacks any entertainment value. To those who say that movies can do away with entertainment value, I say look at documentaries. The plot of Sunset Boulevard moves along fine, but there isn't much intruige, much stakes involved. Joes death is already shown at the start of the film, and we can easily guess that he falls in love with Betty, and it is his leaving Desmond which gets him killed. There is no tension or suspense with the plot, no satisfaction with its resolution, and no likeability or ability to connect with its characters. I do not advocate for pictures full of sunsets and buttercups, but sunset boulevard felt slightly abstruse and distant for me to connect with. I much enjoyed Wilders other Noir, Double Indemnity, which seems to be the opposite- it felt so real, as if we were inhabiting the characters ourselves, and it is full of suspense and tension, while being steamy, thrilling, and tragic at the same time. I'm afraid for me, Sunset Boulevard will be dour and passionless, a technical and artistic triumph, but a triumph which is faraway, a triumph I cannot share and enjoy as much."
k-cronin,"Nov 12, 2009",5/10,"Classified as a film noir, or a black comedy it held true through and through. The movie started out with great imaging in the first first few scenes of seeing Joe dead with his eyes wide open basically looking at you in the pool. I noticed this whole movie was based around that one big pool. Then, once the image is set in our mind, the story and plot comes in, and time is reversed back to where it all began. This was the first film that I have seen where the Mis-en-scene was really breath taking. It was the first film where a movie used real names in Hollywood at the time. Wilder showed that the set was at Paramount Pictures. Wilder showed how movies were started and made. Also, this was the first movie of that time where i noticed other references to movies in the film. First film I have seen relevant to todays time period. Great lighting throughout the film. The settings looked expensive. Yet again, I have seen this house before in other films. They use the same houses to film quite often. Gloria Swanson was a great, intense actress. I really felt her character during the whole movie. I loved how she went insane at the end over her fame and not being what she once was. She really pulled this character off and made it believable. It was a good movie, I wouldn't watch it again, but it was worth watching the first time."
lauloi,"Sep 7, 2001",N/A,"Despite a few flaws, Billy Wilder's condemnation of Hollywood's egotism is one of the best. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is grim, often depressing, and truly unforgettable. Its portrayals of a narcissistic woman's hunger for now-vanished fame, and the tough-guy writer who is engulfed by her destructive ambitions, overcomes some slight script flaws that result from over-striving for the noir tone. Sometimes the emphasis on the characters' utter doom is hard to take; more often, it is extremely effective.William Holden is perfect in the role of Joe Gillis, a down-on-his-luck scriptwriter; many actors could not convey his mixture of repulsion and fascination with the ex-movie star. Gloria Swanson is occasionally too melodramatic, but her grotesqueness distinguishes her character from the classic femme fatale of most films noir. Altogether a great film-- the camerawork alone is worth watching."
brefane,"Aug 21, 2005",10/10,"Brilliant film that is easily Wilder's best. A true classic that deserves to be ranked alongside Citizen Kane. And comparing the 2 films in terms of acting, atmosphere, dialog, conflict, symbolism, and theme (to say nothing of depth): Sunset Boulevard surpasses Kane. The ending is unforgettable and ironic:Max gets to direct, Norma makes a ""comeback"" before the cameras, and Joe has a story, his own. Like Kane, Sunset Boulevard begins with the end. The first shot is of the gutter with the film's title printed on the curb,and the first shot of Joe floating lifelessly in Norma's pool shows us he has sunk even lower: the film proceeds to show us how he got there.Sunset Boulevard is about the march of time:what time and technology does to people and what happens to those who don't or can't keep in step. And like Norma, the new Hollywood seems to be leaving Joe behind. The 2 cars in Norma's garage represent an unspoken bond between Joe and Norma; except for those cars the outside world has little use for these two. The finance company wants to repossess Joe's car and Paramount wants to use Norma's for a film.The acting is unsurpassable;the dialog and narration memorable, and the atmosphere in that decaying mansion is palpable. One of those films, like Kane, that improves with repeated viewings. Endlessly brilliant. The film hasn't aged a bit, and Swanson and VonStroheim lend it an authenticity that would be impossible for any subsequent version to equal. Essential viewing.The Paramount released DVD looks great and has worthwhile extras."
Dan1863Sickles,"Jan 27, 2010",10/10,"Do you want to be disturbed?Are you ready for a clammy, ice-cold classic that's relentlessly sad, chilling and upsetting?Try SUNSET BOULEVARD.Where else can you find a movie that starts -- actually starts -- with the main character being dragged out of a swimming pool dead? And then, the poor dope spends two hours telling you how he lost his job, his career, his girl friend, his self respect, and his life.But he got that swimming pool he always wanted.It's horrible to watch Joe Gillis lose everything. William Holden gives his character so much smarts and charm, you just can't believe he can be snuffed out so easily. But that's what Hollywood does -- and the message is that if it can happen to Joe, it can happen to anyone.On the other hand, Norma Desmond is truly a fiend out of hell. Gloria Swanson will never be equaled in her courage, playing a woman who is more repulsive and hateful than any modern serial killer or hatchet wielding maniac. And yet all she wants is to go on being young and beautiful forever, sharing the magic of her stardom with ""those wonderful people out there in the dark!"" And the message is, if this monster is what's in front of the camera, who knows how many other monsters are out there -- in the dark?At the heart of this movie is an intriguing contradiction. On the one hand, the chilling madness of Norma Desmond is as real and modern as the ghastly antics of the late Michael Jackson. (Funeral for a chimpanzee, anyone?) On the other hand, the anguish of Joe Gillis at being ""kept"" by an older woman is almost (and I do mean almost) too sexist and out of date to keep the viewer involved in the story.Consider how this story would play if the gender roles were reversed. What if Norma Desmond were a tough, male Western star of the silents -- someone like legendary stuntman/cowpoke Tom Mix. And what if the young screenwriter were a pretty young woman with a cheerful, irreverent, upbeat personality, sort of like Carole Lombard or Katherine Hepburn? If the two of them got together it would seem sweet, romantic, not repulsive and chilling. Particularly if the eager young female helped him to get over the death of a beloved wife, or maybe his horse.The point is, no one would be horrified if a 50 something male star seduced a bright young woman in her late twenties or thirties. In fact it would be regarded as rather romantic by a lot of people.A lot of the ""horror"" of SUNSET BOULEVARD comes from an unthinking assumption -- that women with money and power are unnatural creatures and that they can only attract younger men through evil and manipulation. And there's also the double standard that a woman over 50 is no damned good to a man, but a man over 50 is still in his prime.One final thought: William Holden had a wonderful career well into his seventies, and deservedly so. One of his last great performances was in THE WILD BUNCH, where he plays an aging outlaw named Pike Bishop. Note that Pike has the same basic concerns as Norma Desmond. Have I outlived my era? Can I still command respect? What was my life worth? Yet Pike's struggles to pull off one last job are not only not laughed at -- they're rendered as poignant, admirable, and unbelievably heroic. Pike plays the kind of noble, courageous life-giving elder whose wisdom and humanity -- and even his violent tragic death -- simply serve to rejuvenate an entire community.That's the kind of part a mature actress should be able to play as well!"
slokes,"Oct 10, 2006",10/10,"""Sunset Blvd."" is the funniest movie ever made about the saddest of human conditions, loneliness.Struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) bounces around Hollywood like a pinball, flipped at every turn by the big wheels who ignore his attempts to latch onto their world. Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return (""I hate that word,"" she says of ""comeback""). In her effort to elude time's heartless march, she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's ""The Loved One"" (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points, but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback, but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (""As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?"") or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in ""Young Frankenstein,"" she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased ""Queen Kelly"") shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it.""Sunset Blvd."" makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting."
Mikeonalpha99,"Sep 9, 2005",10/10,"Rumor has it that Gloria Swanson was absolutely devastated that she didn't win the Oscar for Sunset Boulevard. 1950 was an unusually tough year for competitors, with the statuette eventually going to Judy Holiday for Born Yesterday.Admittedly, Gloria is fantastic in this film - she's able to send up herself, while also scandalizing the business she was product of - but the acting chops must really go to William Holden, who provides the willful self-loathing thread that ties much of this noirish and twisted tale together.Director by Billy Wilder, Sunset Boulevard represents classic movie making at its peak. Set in Los Angeles, it's a dark, twisted, cynical tale of love, deceit, and opportunism. The film is all about Hollywood behind the scenes and how screenwriters, directors, and actors will sell themselves out for fame and fortune at a moments notice.Spiritual and emotional emptiness, and the price of fame, greed, narcissism, and ambition is at the heart of this devilishly stylistic film, with the somber mood beginning almost immediately when a dead man is found floating facedown in a swimming pool.The man is hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (a very sexy William Holden). All we know is that Joe was at the run-down mansion of deluded former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Through Joe's voice over narrative it soon becomes clear that he was somehow involved with the wealthy Norma.Down on his luck, three months behind on his rent, and with his car about to be repossessed, Joe accidentally stumbles upon Norma's faded mansion while trying to escape the police. Norma initially mistakes Joe for a coffin-maker for her deceased pet monkey, but once she figures out that he's a screenwriter, she gets him to read one of the scripts she's been working on.Norma is an insane and faded silent-film star, who is hoping against hope to make a comeback. She's bitterly resentful of the price the ""talkies"" have taken on her career, so now she soaks in her own misguided and imagined greatness, in profile with the flickering projector lighting her outline in the dark.Joe is initially hesitant to help the glamorous woman, and then asks $500 a week for his writing services. But slowly we come to realize the contract is actually the other way around. In preparing for her return comeback, Norma quickly turns Joe into a pawn - or more to the point, a slave.Joe becomes a virtual prisoner in her rundown mansion; the moment he leaves, she slits her wrists, forcing him to come back. With minimal resistance, Joe allows himself to settle into the life of a kept man, as Norma desperately showers him with gifts and fine clothing. The house butler, Max von Meyerling (Erich von Stroheim), grimly looks on, tending to Norma's demanding whims and tolerating Joe's disruptive presence.Joe wobbles back and forth between heedless acceptance of his strange companionship with Norma and his half-hearted pursuit of a career. He sneaks away to collaborate on a project with Betty (Nancy Olson), a Paramount script reader who is engaged to Joe's best friend. Betty is gradually falling in love with Joe, but when Norma finds out, that he's been sneaking out to meet wit her, all hell breaks loose.The self-loathing motif is rampant throughout Sunset Boulevard. Max completely does away with his self-respect, Joe hates himself for his unwillingness to commit to a career or love, and seems to sell himself out for money and clothes almost immediately, and Betty despises herself for falling in love with Joe while she's engaged to another.Norma, despite her haughtiness, is the most blatant case of self-disgust. When she isn't raving about her greatness, she comes across as a frightened and tortured soul  a sad and lonely woman, who is not only remarkably self-delusional, but is also trying to grasp one last chance at happiness. She thinks so little of her current 50-year-old self that she no longer acknowledges the present.Sunset Boulevard is a must see movie for cinema buffs. There are lots of treasures to be had here, including Nancy Olson's strangely under appreciated performance as Betty, whose misguided love for Joe spirals the film to its grisly conclusion. There's also the hilarious appearance of a skinny and madly grinning Jack Webb as a happy-go-lucky assistant director, and viewers will get a kick out of the excessive exuberance that Norma displays when she towels down a hunky and hairy-chested Joe at poolside.The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic.Billy Wilder's accomplished direction is full of wide shots that capture the depressing set and brave close-ups of our anti-heroes. But in the end, Sunset Boulevard stands out, as one of the finest examples of the frenzied circus of obsession, fixation, and greed that is oftentimes symbolizes Hollywood.

bmacv,"Sep 9, 2002",10/10,"Nineteen-fifty proved a spectacular year for Hollywood.  The studios enjoyed maximum power and influence, following a decade of unprecedented numbers of ticket-buyers.  Never again would `The Industry' ride so high, with (among other factors) the advent of television.  And three movies released that year have attained almost scriptural status, at least among acolytes sharing a rarefied if rigorous cinematic faith: All About Eve; Caged; and Sunset Blvd.  All three glitter with brilliant epigrams flashing from the polished facets of their gem-like scripts - lines that have entered the language at large, often quoted in ignorance of their provenance.All About Eve was a theater story but Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. was THE Hollywood Story.  (Caged was a women's prison story; enough said.)  And it is as a myth about movie-making, and the erratic trajectory of stardom, that Sunset Blvd. most frequently merits attention.  But of many movies made about Hollywood, none can claim the peculiar potency of this masterpiece, which can still wring from viewers those old Aristotelian emotions of pity and terror (plus a good deal of unholy fun).Its corrosive force springs from the fact that Sunset Blvd. is, first and foremost, about that oldest and deepest of human preoccupations, gender. It tells of catastrophic upheaval in the long-honored `natural' order of affairs between males and females: A virile young man falls prey to an older, more powerful woman.  His tragedy is not the watery end into which he plummets but the slow and painful process of emasculation to which he has given tacit consent.Ohio newspaperman Joe Gillis (William Holden) went west to make his fortune writing pictures, but he works in his bathrobe in a one-room apartment three months behind in the rent.  His car payments are in arrears, too, so his attempts to elude repo men become the fuse that ignites the plot.  A fatal turn takes him into the driveway of 10086 Sunset Boulevard, the Gothic manse where, in wealthy if stifling seclusion, lives legendary queen of the silents Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She grants him asylum, in his view a temporary convenience.  But she has other ambitions.At first those plans seem to be a rather hopeless pipe-dream about returning to the screen, through the vehicle of her screenplay Salome (another cautionary tale of reversed gender roles).  But soon the resourceless Gillis finds himself accepting her largess (a garage apartment, vincuna topcoats, a gold cigarette case inscribed with ""Mad about the boy"") and her control (from `And must you chew gum?"" to `Of course you didn't - I wouldn't let you').  Once Desmond sinks her talons into him - and Swanson's own stint in the silents pay off handsomely, for no one in the sound era ever deployed claws like hers - he finds he cannot leave, even at the cost of his self-esteem and greater happiness.The third character in the movie offers a dress rehearsal of the submissive role Gillis is bound for.  Desmond's Teutonic butler Max (Erich von Stroheim) caters to her every whim and guards her castle of illusions.  In a role suggestive of the male - and generally gay - assistants, publicists and fans who cluster dotingly around female stars, he fusses over girlish details (`Madam will pardon me, but the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced"").As the movie charts its inexorable course, new humiliations and revelations strip layer after layer from Gillis' own illusions.  In a chic haberdashery where Desmond takes him to smarten up his wardrobe, a clerk whispers, ""Well, if the lady is paying, why not take the vicuna?""  (Holden wordlessly reacts with rage and shame.)  And when he sneaks back from what Desmond suspects is a night of tom-catting - he's actually writing a script with a young colleague (Nancy Olson) who's falling for him - the vigilant Max lurks in wait for him.  Challenged by the fed-up Gillis, the butler reveals not only that he discovered Desmond when he was the great auteur Max von Mayerling (Stroheim, of course, was a grandiose director of the silent era), but that he was ""Madam's first husband"" as well.   In the hard-as-ice script by Wilder and Charles Brackett, this stands as, hands down, its chilliest moment.  (By contrast, its sunniest involves Desmond's return to Paramount studios, when a light swings upon her so a new generation of actors and crew can pay homage to her glory.)Sunset Blvd. catalogues the kept-man's degradation to which Gillis acquiesces.  He's moved from chauffeur's quarters to the lavish suite adjoining Desmond's - and from which, owing to Madam's ""fits of melancholy,"" the locks have been removed.  He endures the raised eyebrows of Desmond's bridge partners (Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton) when he interrupts their game to ask for money.  He finds himself as the sole guest (apart from Max and the orchestra) at her New Year's Eve soiree, tangoing on the tile Valentino told her to install, where she finally confesses her love for him.  (As though he never expected this development, he storms out to a raucous party among his young former friends, only to race back after she swipes his razor and succumbs to her melancholia.)  He even lets her towel off his bedewed torso after a dip in the pool she has had filled for him.Desmond, in a nutshell, has taken a scalpel to his manhood long before the final denouement - precipitated by one final, doomed bid for freedom.  And perhaps he prefers the end that he must know awaits him to taking a bus back to Dayton with his tail tucked between his legs.  But fate proves `strangely merciful' to Norma Desmond. In the movie's last, most iconic scene (`I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille'), she once again triumphs under the harsh lights and in front of the clattering cameras.  The full fetch of her looniness at long last unleashed, she gets what she wanted all along: not the boy she was so mad about but the ""return,"" however delusional, she craved."
simplyfsl,"Feb 21, 2009",10/10,"I am a big fan of Film Noir Genre and also love Billy Wilder movies especially 'Double Indemnity', 'Witness for the Prosecution' and 'Apartment'.No one can keep you more glued to the seat than him but when I watched 'Sunset Blvd', in 20 minutes I was already aware I was watching his masterpiece, The best film noir ever.The tension created by Wilder to the mystery of Norma Desmond character acts as duel progress to show a lonely woman and also the changing trends of Hollywood and the impact on stars that fade.It also tells the story and struggle of nascent writers in Hollywood.Well throughout the movie I didn't stop saying WOW!! The lighting, the camera angles, the sets, the screenplay all add to the noir atmosphere but it is all topped by wonderful Direction which is really flawless.Also, realistic acting performances by both William Holden and Gloria Swanson are 10/10.You can't really chose which one has done his/her part better.I never put spoilers in my reviews so I would highly recommend to watch this movie.Even if you are a Noir fan,you will love it.If you want to start watching this genre,start with the best,the crown jewel of film noir and that's undoubtedly 'Sunset Blvd' ."
Russian_buttermilk,"Jun 15, 2007",6/10,"Not a horrible movie. This movie is supposed to be a behind-the-tabloids kind of movie (think liza minelli reality show). It is so stereotypical of how the media views washed up celebrities. I do not understand how this film is rated so high. It is a decent movie (a borderline good movie) I should say but the story, plot, and directing is uninspired and unimaginative compared to the other films rated high on the lists of film critics. My review of this movie may be a little off though as a mere 24 hours earlier I had watched zoolander for the 3rd time. Which by the way brings me to another point. This movie takes itself way too seriously. Its hard to take someone seriously if that person is too serious himself."
British_Revolver,"Oct 5, 2005",10/10,"Billy Wilder's classic ""Sunset Blvd."" is a masterpiece about suspense, mystery, and intrigue. I think that Gloria Swanson should've gotten an Oscar for her performance as Norma Desmond. Swanson stole the movie and this is one of the best acting I've ever seen.Rating: 10/10William Holden and Nancy Olsen did okay jobs as the supporting characters but it was still good. Wilder also did well with the cinematography and directing in this. From the very beginning with the music and the narration, you know that something's going to be excellent.The plot was also suspenseful when you have two people like Swanson and Holden working together on opposite sides. The idea of having a ""Norma Desmond"" in ""Sunset Blvd."" gave it more mystery and made it more interesting.In conclusion, everybody should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime!"
august_sanders,"Apr 8, 2025",6/10,"Ah yes, my favorite type of movie to review-those that fall into the gray area, neither pitiful nor extraordinary. Sunset Boulevard has some interesting moments that add to the suspense it's trying to create. While it may drawback the curtain of Hollywood, does it really? It doesn't show anything of real value in that department in my opinion. The romance is fine. Drawn out and confusing as you try and figure out exactly what everyone's relationships are but fine. The characters are good and are honestly the backbone of this movie. The dialogue can be dull at times though. Other than that the story, music and acting are all fantastic. Ok the music is great for 1950 and I'm not too picky so I may not be the best person to talk to. I can say that the acting is good especially Norma at the end. Absolute cinema. Watching him get shot was also fun."
gezmar,"Mar 28, 2002",N/A,"After reading Wilder Times, one of the many biographies of Billy Wilder, just recently, I naturally revisted many of his films in the last few weeks. And today, I have just read of the death of the great Billy Wilder. This has prompted me to write my first review, on the IMDB, of my favourite of this man's long series of great films and screenplays.Sunset Blvd is suspenseful, witty, and tragic. Brilliantly written and directed, it is a classic for many reasons, but most notably that it is possible to like the movie more each time with each viewing. It may not be possible to appreciate such a detailed and rich film in one viewing. Whether it be the real Hollywood stars in cameos(Buster Keaton, Cecil B. Demille etc), or the skillful casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich Von Stroheim, that adds such a grim reality to their, all ready, well written roles, to just how frank and bleakly honest this movie was for it's time, in it's portrayal of Hollywood.For William Holden, a very handsome Hollywood leading man, to take on the role of a poor bitter writer,Joe Gillis, was, I consider a brave role, even by many of todays leading man standards. Gloria Swanson prevents the character of Norma becoming a ridiculous caricature and keeps her real and therefore tragic.(None the less, Ms Swanson also gives a famously delicious performance in this feisty role) And Nancy Olsen, who plays a very grounded and honest, Betty Schaefer,  perfectly matches the unreality of the world of Norma Desmond.Goodbye, Billy Wilder. You will be missed."
agrawalmannu,"Aug 30, 2005",8/10,"This movie opened my eyes to the genius of Billy Wilder compelling me to dig all his other movies. I watched his other movies one after the other and I was never disappointed. He really made some great movies on great themes without ever losing his focus on the entertainment value of the movie. 'Stalag 17', 'double indemnity', 'the apartment' all are such great movies.Most of the movie is narrated in first person and you see what the protagonist sees, a technique which has been used in so many movies after this. The narration is flawless and drama so intense that I watched the whole movie without batting an eyelid. The characters are real with shades of grey that you empathize and dislike at the same time. The whole thing is dark and a film noir in true sense.One of my all time favorites and I cannot over-recommend this movie to anyone."
Lejink,"Aug 3, 2010",9/10,"What a movie! Boasting one of the best ever opening scenes and most remembered conclusions, with filling to match, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a magnificently cynical overview of Hollywood, uncommonly using real names and real people for veracity.Starting with the magnificent conceit of having the whole movie narrated by a dead man, we roll back from the unforgettable shot of William Holden's corpse looking down at us from the bottom of Norma Desmond's pool in what must be the longest ever flashback in movie history taking us up to the moment of his death and its aftermath.The movie works on so many levels, taking in the hollowness of Hollywood, the transience of fame, the fear of rejection, the onset of age, there's all this and more as William Holden's kept man finds in the end he can't escape the gilded cage that faded movie goddess Desmond has built around him. The plotting is sure, the direction masterful and the cinematography at times evocative of the best monochromatic shots from ""Citizen Kane"" (there can be no higher praise), especially in its handling of perspective shots.It goes without saying that Wilder and Brackett's dialogue is brilliant with so many of the phrases entering movie legend the second they're given breath. Holden is superb as the doomed writer, closely followed by Erich Von Stroheim as Desmond's first husband now reduced to being her lackey, excusing her every erratic action out of love. Gloria Swanson goes over the top to Everest level and occasionally overdoes it, but that may have been the director's point anyway, although I think it was right that she didn't win the Oscar this year, despite being nominated and heavily tipped. It's not every film you'll see boasting Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper and Cecil B De Mille in a row in the acting credits, but while the first two get the merest of cameos, De Mille is completely natural and sympathetic to his requirement to both indulge and yet brush off Desmond's misplaced ambitions as himself.Add to the broth Franz Waxman's atmospheric score and you have the perfect recipe for a genre - busting film noir from maestro Wilder. I make it a point never to watch films more than once if I can help it but I just know there's so much more here than meets the eye, and that's more than enough for starters."
SpaceComics,"Sep 24, 2005",9/10,"Sunset Boulevard is a real classic I first learned about from parodies on The Carol Burnett Show in the 1970s. I didn't see the film until some 20 years later, when I found it fascinating. William Holden (Rachel And The Sranger, The Earthling) plays Joe Gillis, a bankrupt B-movie writer who drives his car into the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard to dodge the repo men. But the dilapidated place is occupied by two fascinating but weird characters, former silent screen star Norma Desmond (Goria Swanson) and her butler, balding, German-accented Max (Erich von Stroheim). Norma hires Joe to ghost-write a screenplay for her come-back, but he soon finds he's as much a kept-man as a writer, enabling more than one of the has-been starlet's delusions. The characters of both Norma and Max are fascinating enough to keep the movie going, and their relationship turns out to be more than it seems. The cast includes a very young Jack Webb, actually speaking like a human being, and appearances by Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves. Carol Burnett made great fun of the role with Harvey Korman in the Max role 2 decades later, but the movie (directed and co-written by Billy Wilder) remains a grand drama, character study, and serious comment on the Hollywood star system."
werefox08,"Aug 24, 2012",10/10,"Yet another magnificent motion picture directed by the great Billy Wilder. The magical performance by Gloria Swanson will be analyzed and deeply appreciated for ever. William Holden as the young novice writer also is great here. The play between the two ""stars"" is tactful and completely convincing. The movie is full of memorable lines (the writing is flawless) ...its such a great pity movie writers to-day simply CANT do it. I wonder why that is...but its true. Swanson gambles everything on her ability to go for broke....without looking fake. She does it with an amazing piece of breathtaking acting. Watching her is almost like watching a tight rope walker....without the net. This can be viewed multiple times...a real Classic. Gets an automatic 10 / 10."
Steffi_P,"Apr 14, 2010",9/10,"With a medium like cinema, which had such a distinct and holistic culture all of its own, it is bound sooner or later to lose itself in nostalgia. Either that or cynical self-parody. Sunset Boulevard is not about the way motion pictures were – it is about the way motion picture people were, and continued to be.Indeed, the style of Sunset Boulevard was the very epitome of modern film-making – voice-over narration, fluid camera-work, crisp cinematography. These contemporary trappings really serve to deepen the contrast and sharpen the disrespectful onslaught upon the olden days. Take the protagonist voice-over, something writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett really made an art of. It may often be functional, cutting corners in the narrative or elucidating on screen events, but more often than not it is superfluous to the story, and acts as a kind of enjoyably wry commentary on proceedings. It's a stylistic layer as much as the overstuffed set design and chiaroscuro lighting.Director Billy Wilder is often said (by Ed Sikov for example) to be someone who ""does not call attention to the shot"". On the contrary, he actually constantly grabs us with the images. While he was never fond of obvious trickery, Wilder loves the weirdness of natural effects – such as Swanson's face skull-like in her sunglasses, or the close-up on her spinning parasol which begins the bathing beauties routine. He is great at filling the shot with ""clues"" and reminders, bringing them to our attention at the right moment – such as those holes in the doors where the locks should be, which a line in the dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts.But this is really a movie about stars, and central to Sunset Boulevard is the performance by Gloria Swanson. It was incredibly brave of Swanson to play such a brazen caricature of the kind of woman she could have become. But she brings all her long-standing talent and the knowledge of experience into the role. Norma Desmond is as much a creation of Swanson as she is of Wilder and Brackett. She has the kind of sleek, animalistic movement of a silent-era vamp, but tinges it with a frank depiction of middle-aged indignity. Her acting may be exaggerated and far from realistic, but remember she is playing a woman for whom life has become an act. Swanson is hammy because hamminess is real for that character. She clearly knew exactly what she was doing and what the pictures was about. Compare that to DeMille, who really had no sense of irony, and it's amazing he agreed to appear here. His performance is assuredly naturalistic (and ironically far better than most of what passes for acting in his own pictures), although that is also perfect for the part he plays here – being himself! Whether or not he had agreed to appear, DeMille would have been a central figure to this story. He was really the sole survivor of the silent era; the only individual – star, producer or director – from that time who was still a top dog. And although Sunset Boulevard sets its sights on the Hollywood of yesteryear, it was really the Hollywood of 1950 that Wilder and Brackett were gunning for. Like Norma Desmond, the post-war industry had passed its heyday and was really living off the receipts of its past glories. The studio system was crumbling, and TV was encroaching on its territory just as sound had encroached on Norma's thirty years earlier. It was now the more modest productions by younger, free-spirited filmmakers – productions like Sunset Boulevard itself – that were beginning to rise to the surface."
ccthemovieman-1,"Dec 23, 2005",8/10,"On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too. This is a good visual film, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again.Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn't supposed to look good. That's one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim. He's amazing in this film. In supporting roles, I also enjoyed the wholesome Nancy Olsen and the young Jack Webb of ""Dragnet"" fame.This combination of drama-soap opera-film noir is one of the professional critics all-time favorite films. Odd how they love movies and Hollywood stars so much, yet relish films that tear them down, as this does."
dudumnz,"May 11, 2022",7/10,"It's nicely filmed, Gloria Swanson's performance is majesticly horrifying.For that time it's interesting to see a strong critical remark about etharism in the cinema industry."
yenlo,"Aug 20, 1999",9/10,"Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Erich von Stroheim star in this Billy Wilder cinematic masterpiece about an aging essentially forgotten silent film star who has delusions about returning to pictures. Made in 1950 this film will capture the viewer each time it is seen. The references to the bygone silent movie era are somehow chilling. Much like when a person walks around ancient Rome or Egypt wondering how something so powerful and advanced could come to an end. Both Swanson and Stroheim were of course giants during the silent film years and their performances is this great movie even seem to show their perhaps real life animosity toward talking films.Holden as Joe Gillis a rapidly becoming down on his like screen writer who stumbles into Swansons world is fantastic. This is certainly one motion picture that could never and should never be remade or colorized, as the Black and White photography is brilliant. It didn't make AFI's top five of all time and perhaps should have. You can't consider yourself as one of ""All those wonderful people out there in the dark"" if you've never seen Sunset Blvd."
JEBaeza,"Jan 31, 2024",7/10,"From my point of view, Sunset Boulevard touches on various uncommon themes and it does it creatively. It also has some twists here and there which I honestly did not expect. The characters are well-written and the performances by William Holden and Gloria Swanson are very good and impressive.The idea of having a forgotten silent film star and a screenwriter without a stable job as the main characters is very interesting. On one hand, she can afford to have a luxurious life, but her life feels incomplete without working on movies and being a protagonist. On the other hand, he has lost passion for the art and just writes to make a living. From here, the same message applies to both characters: to prioritize what really matters in life. For Norma, she has to accept that fame is not forever and she is no longer what she once was. For Joe, he must learn that money isn't everything, and it is certainly not more important than the relationships with the people you love.Although it didn't have me on the edge of my seat and it is not the type of film I love, I enjoyed Sunset Boulevard and would recommend it."
ss3,"Feb 22, 2005",9/10,"I have no problem with the acclaim Billy Wilder has received for this movie but I would like to call attention to Charles Brackett, probably the main writer. In particular I would like to see his ""To Each His Own"" a very fine tear jerker, made into a DVD. Brackett had a deep sensitivity to the older women he wrote about. He should be rediscoveredAll the usual kudos about this movie are well deserved. I don't personally enjoy it that much because I find it hard to react to creepy characters even when I can understand them and my head tells me this is true and well done. But as a character Norma Desmond is unforgettable, powerfully executed if unappreciated by me."
dwpollar,"Jan 4, 2003",8/10,"1st watched 1/4/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Billy Wilder): Wonderful performances and edge of your seat story-telling in this classic Billy Wilder film.  What I think really holds this picture together is the well-down over-the-top portrayal of silent film star Norma Desmond by Gloria Swanson.  William Holden also does a good job of standing his own as well in a quiet but effective performance.  Basically, this is a story  about a failing screenwriter's accidental encounter with Norma Desmond who still lives in the past with the household staff playing along at every beat. He then becomes entangled in her web and has to fight himself out of her grip, but struggles with this because he is being taken care of financially and socially. But once Norma gets jealous of Holden's encounter with another woman the inevitable happens(which I will not give away).  Overall, this was daring filmmaking for it's time with only some minor annoyances but otherwise splashingly good."
Pamsanalyst,"Nov 8, 2004",10/10,"Is it ""The Player"" were movie people come up with ideas for films like Rosemary's Baby meets Amadeus? Everyone loved these lines, and the cameos, but it had all been done before in Wilder's opening scene, and done better!I saw this in 1951, eight years old and living in an oil camp with my parents in Venezuela. Twenty years passed before I saw it again, but all those years it stuck with me. There was the man floating dead in the pool, but telling me this story, the mysterious funeral for the dead monkey, the old people sitting around playing bridge, von Stroheim flitting in and out, menacing to a boy my age, and bug-eyed Norma descending the stairs.It is a movie obsessed with death, but aren't most of our great films? Joe Gillis is like the female lead in a Gothic novel. 'Don't go in that house, Joe' but he does, and he meets the wicked witch, except she is dressed like Charlie Chaplin and she has real talent, while Gillis is no more than an interloper, an uninvited guest who does not come out the other side in the end.It was the first film I remember seeing, and will always remain my favorite.And of Wilder, the Viennese cynic? Who else can combine Sunset with Double Indemnity and Some Like It Hot, and have The Apartment etc etc etc hiding in the background."
Richie-67-485852,"Apr 1, 2018",8/10,"From the fifties to the seventies, Sunset Blvd was the place to go and be. You could cruise it and there were places it could be walked for blocks and nightclubs galore. I even visited an old empty mansion in the hills, broke into it and walked around. Everyone said it was haunted and the police used to come and chase people away. Great night out. Some of that nostalgia is captured in this movie and is in the background as well as theme of the movie. As far as the movie itself goes, it is a good story, well told and acted out to perfection. It presents an older woman using a younger man for her vain and selfish purposes and the man going along with it first out of necessity and later on like an insect in a spider's web. Stuck and no where to go with a hungry female prowling around. Nicely done on this point and the point of everyone coming to Hollywood to struggle until they got recognized for anything and start to make some real money. Schwabs drugstore in the movie was a real hangout too. BTW...when one wasn't on Sunset Blvd they were cruising Hollywood Blvd. There was always some action going on these two streets. Lastly, I got the chills watching this as I had a woman chasing me just like this one chased William Holden (no sex) offering me money, free lunches/dinners and gifts galore if I only devote myself to her. Mind you I am married but it didn't stop this obsessive person including her making me her heir. I even told her off (many times) and she would not let go. Creepy and dysfunctional to say the least. Enjoy this glimpse of real life back then but still happening today here and there and everywhere.... Come and visit ..."
orangehead225,"Nov 11, 2009",7/10,"this was a great movie it started with a flash forward. the camera man narrates us through the movie until the main character takes over.great lighting and shadows, clear picture liked the way they told the story. They had a fake background while driving the cars that was really unrealistic. Loved the staircase design in the womens house but the pictures of herself were a bit much and it almost always seemed dark in the house maybe because of her attitude she seemed to be a dark sad woman. music went with everything especially when it was dramatic like when the man finally got mad at the end. There were some things that caught my ears not my eyes like the verbal usage the rainbow was the bathroom, he used the word gilluopie (sp) to refer to his car and the white elephant to describe her house. overall this was a good move I enjoyed it very much.

ramazini-76390,"Sep 22, 2018",6/10,"With all those annoying superheroes flicks being released on a daily basis, I have decided to explore some classic material. Arbitrarily, I decided exploring the 50's. So far, I am loving it. So many cool stories and talented actors. I am glad to have decided doing it.My favorite one so far has been Bette Davis' ""All About Eve"". Such a cool movie in many ways.About Sunset Blvd, i was also very pleased. However, I honestly expected more from it. It's not that It didn't live up to my expectations. Acting was nice, in general. Plot a little predictable, but well constructed. I think my problem was that maybe i just didn't like Mister Holden that much. I just didn't find him charismatic enough.Anyway, it was a cool movie, but definitely not an 8.5 (maybe a solid 7)."
HotToastyRag,"Nov 12, 2018",3/10,"""Alright, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup,"" is the oft-misquoted line from Sunset Boulevard, one of the greatest Oscar-baits in history. An aging silent movie actress lives reclusively in her Sunset Boulevard mansion and dwells on her past fame instead of her ability to adjust to the modern era. A young hopeful screenwriter crosses her path and she becomes obsessed with the idea of a comeback. Wouldn't every actress over the age of forty kill for that part, knowing they'd probably reserve the Best Actress Oscar in 1951? Well, Pola Negri, Norma Shearer, Mary Pickford, Mae West, and my personal preference, Greta Garbo, all refused the part. Anyone who knows their history knows that Gloria Swanson didn't win her Oscar in 1951; she was beaten out by the ridiculous Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday.Part of Sunset Boulevard that tugs at the audience's heartstrings is the similarities between Gloria Swanson's career and the plot points written for her character, Norma Desmond. Gloria was a silent movie star who worked prolifically for Paramount Studios; Norma has a line of dialogue: ""Without me, there would be no Paramount."" Gloria's career tapered off when sound pictures became popular, as did Norma's. Many of Gloria's silent movies were directed by Erich von Stoheim; in Sunset Boulevard, Eric plays Norma's devoted butler who believes she's the ""greatest star of all"". If you find all those connections heartwarming, you'll probably like this movie.All the other parts of Sunset Boulevard, the ones that don't tug on the audience's heartstrings, make me dislike the movie. First off, the opening scene is one of the worst opening scenes in any old movie I've ever seen! The beginning ruins the entire story, and there's no way the audience can forget what's just been spoiled. If by some miracle you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and fast-forward the first five minutes.I'm not a William Holden fan, so I would have preferred Montgomery Clift, who was actually signed on for the part, and whom I like very much. Fred MacMurray, another choice during casting, would have also been great, since he mastered the ""voice-over"" film noir technique years earlier. All the scenes of Bill by himself or with his love interest, the forgettable Nancy Olson, feel like a B-picture. The first few times I saw this movie, my mind had tried to help me by forgetting William Holden was even in it; I was continually disappointed to watch him in the vast majority of the film.This one's a classic, so if you're an old movie buff, you can't really get away with skipping this one. Don't feel bad if it doesn't become your favorite, though; you're not alone. I don't really like this one and feel the connection Gloria Swanson had to her character elevated it to Classic status. She may have won the ""part of a lifetime"" but in my opinion, many, many other actresses could have given an equally effective performance."
bigsleepj,"Aug 21, 2002",N/A,"Sunset Blvd is certainly one of the best movies I've seen, and I enjoyed it immensely. The mother of all Anti-Hollywood movies is still the best.It is unusually abstract for a 1950s movie (even for a modern movie) and any arthouse lover would enjoy this it.But what I did not like about it is that it is a very cruel movie. But I guess it's part of the movie's theme: Hollywood is cruel and don't have anything to do with it.It works on the same concept of the Coen Brother's ""Barton Fink"" that says warns you that ""if you want to win in Hollywood you'll have to be willing to loose your soul.""Scary though.But still I can't wait for the DVD of Sunset Blvd."
ambusched94,"Dec 11, 2023",10/10,"A masterpiece. The whole cast is superb. An iconic film from the 1950s. The film noir atmosphere is moody and evocative. The film set piece of Norma Desmond's decaying mansion is decadent but has a ghostly quality where it's seen more fulfilled days. Which yes, it has. Norma is still holding on to her past glory days of fame as a silent film star and she finds this easier to deal with having screenwriter Joe Gillis be her companion and, in her mind, more than that. A film about obsession, pessimism, ageism and Hollywood's cruel treatment of stars who outlived their heyday. A MUST-WATCH for all film lovers."
jamesjustice-92,"Aug 31, 2022",10/10,"""Sunset Boulevard"" is written and directed by the remarkable Billy Wilder and stars William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim. The story revolves around an aged and forgotten movie star and a young and down on his luck screenwriter who happen to cross their paths and gain something out of their relationship: a young man seeks for money and fame and the old lady is simply looking for company and someone to care for.The movie's plot reflected on so many different silent era actors who just couldn't transit to the talkies and had to leave the limelight they deserved. Most of them turned out to be abandoned and died nobodies, legends once great and shining brighter than sun but now nothing more than a mention in the history books. This picture is about a person so devoted to her own self she didn't see the years go by, she didn't want to; she lived in the past absorbed by her days of glory and the only thing she needed was adoration. That's what she found in a young man's soul who came to her house by mistake: fate brought them together but instead of giving her what she longs for he uses her wealth to gain his own profit out of the poor woman's heart and her troubled mind. ""Sunset blvd"" is not only a street, it's also a place where dreams crash, where hearts break, people suffer and literally anything can happen.Mr Wilder's masterful script and directing, covered in the most beautiful score by Franz Waxman (undoubtedly his best work for which he received an Academy Award) and peppered by the most outstanding performances by the silent movie star Gloria Swanson who got to shine brightest again as well as the silent movie director/actor Erich von Stroheim and splendid work of the talented William Holden that altogether made this motion picture one of the most brilliant movies ever."
bryangary65,"Jan 7, 2021",8/10,"Worth watching alone for the brilliant performance of Gloria Swanson, and its a travesty she did not win the Oscar for her role."
JasonHMA,"Sep 28, 2023",9/10,"Billy Wilders work setting the stage for more modern cinema here almost acts like a passing of the baton. Swanson's performance is so crazy over the top that it is certainly absurd by today's standards. But she owned it. She was a silent film star descending into madness in the age of talkies and in that context her performance is justified and stands out against the more realistic portrayals elsewhere in the movie. I have to admit... I'm a latecomer to this movie and I knew Kristen wiigs impersonation long before seeing the movie. This resulted in some unintentional laughter as I thought back to the Vincent price Halloween skit on SNL. But this did not lessen my enjoyment of the movie, maybe even enhanced it. I continue to enjoy my trip through the Billy wilder portfolio (double indemnity, 7 year itch, some like it hot and sunset)."
j-schardt,"Mar 31, 2010",7/10,"Sunset Blvd. is a excellent murder mystery thats leaves you guessing until the end. There is a great shot right in the beginning where the camera is underwater looking up at the dead body directly above face down in the water and the detectives looking down upon him. This scene is actually the end of the movie. Then the movie starts from the beginning and shows you how the body got there. The film starts off fast with a great car chasing scene. There great sound effects off tire's screeching around turns and eventually one of the tires even pops. The main character Joe soon arrives at a mysterious,creepy,and what seems to be abandon Maison. This mansion gives the perfect creepy vibe to the movie. Right away there's a very scary shot of Norma looking down at him through an upstairs window, a very classic shot to warn the audience something just not right with the house. The inside of the house is even creepier with tons of weird directions and organ music playing in the background. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Norma is standing in front of the projector light and it looks as though smoke is coming off her head really signaling to the audience of her evil mysterious ways.Norma's character overall is great she did a very wonderful Job of play the crazy old actress from Hollywood with priceless facial expressions. I think without her strong acting it definitely would not have been such a good film. I didn't enjoy how Joe and the younger Women fell for each other so fast and didn't really understand the scene where they looked like they were going to make out in the bathroom of her boyfriends party. It was very awkward and strange, as well as the rest of the film but I just didn't think it made sense to put in. Overall its a good film and would recommend it."
philip-ct,"Mar 3, 2006",10/10,"This is a gem of a film: wonderful acting from William Holden (as a struggling scriptwriter in Hollywood), a mesmerising performance from Gloria Swanson (as a faded ""silent"" star, yet to come to terms with the ""talkies"") and very good support from Erich von Strheim (as the faithful manservant) and Nancy Ohlson (as Gillis'(Holden's)girlfriend.)It is a mesmerising film: even the over-the-top performances are measured! At once a mystery-thriller, social comment, satire, drama with touches of comedy, this film really impresses. This is a timeless classic, a brilliantly insightful commentary on Hollywood.Yet the film isn't only cerebral: there is an emotional facet to it. I was amazed, enraptured. Get the DVD: the special features are excellent, too."
danjakubik,"Mar 7, 2004",N/A,"March 7, 2004****  Excellent!""Sunset Boulevard"" ranks with ""All About Eve"" as one of the best written and best acted films of the 1950's. To me, 1950, ranks as high as the golden year of 1939 for Hollywood.I have just seen ""Sunset Boulevard"" for the very first time. I was very favorably impressed. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is the inspiration for all other Hollywood inside story films that came after.Gloria Swanson plays Norma Desmond who is a lonely insecure once famous silent film star living in isolation with her servant in a lavish, but neglected Hollywood mansion from the 1920's. William Holden plays the role of Joe Gillis, a down on his luck B film Hollywood writer who accidentally discovers her mansion. Erich Von Stroheim plays the loyal house servant Max Von Mayerling to Norma Desmond.A combination film noir, satire with dark, cynical humor, ""Sunset Boulevard"" excels. Being narrated by a dead man is a nice dark touch. There are cameos of several famous silent film stars including Buster Keaton, who play themselves in the film. Most notably, Cecile B. DeMile plays himself, who directed Gloria Swanson (in real life) in some of her silent films.The film has a romance substory that is done well. I believe this substory really serves as a distraction from the film's dark cynical tone.Both ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""All About Eve"" are two excellent films of the same year (1950). Both were nominated for Academy Awards in many categories including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Both films had similiar stories. To decide which film was the best film of 1950 was truly difficult and shows the folly of the Academy Awards. Both are excellent films (in different ways): most notably for writing and acting. ""Sunset Boulevard"" has the advantage of better cinematography for it's film noir, moody look and feel. ""All About Eve"" does have a ""stagey"" look and feel to it, using basic and simple cinematography. Both films excel with similiar stories, done with different tone and mood.""Sunset Boulevard"" stands the test of time as a classic film, perhaps better understood and appreciated by film buffs, nonetheless, one of Hollywood's best films."
aprilzh,"Jan 3, 2020",10/10,"Sunset Blvd. is a beautiful film and a masterpiece to behold. It is shot in the most gorgeous black and white which truly gives the silver screen its name. Everything about this film is gorgeous. The lighting and shadows are masterfully done. The acting is wonderful. And the story is absolutely brilliant. It may be true that it's the same thing we've seen a million times since this, but this was the first. This was the film that started it all. The story is so out of the box and the tone is perfect. It was written and directed by a true master. This is a wonderful classic that will live on for centuries to come."
inkblot11,"Aug 19, 2013",9/10,"Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a ""kept man"". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it."
williwaw,"Jul 27, 2011",10/10,"Billy Wilder who has my vote as the Greatest Director of all Time with a body of work that is stunning: Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, Sabrina, and his comedic masterpiece Some Like It Hot, made his greatest film Sunset Blvd and today when I see it over and over I discover new tidbits of Information. Brilliant. William Holden who would win an Oscar a few years later in Wilder's Stalag and would star in Wilder's great late career masterpiece Fedora is superb as Joe Gillis. The key role in this movie is played to a fare thee well by Gloria Swanson who is magnificent, and gives in my opinion the finest performance by a female star ever; Gloria Swanson became Norma Desmond. As we know Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar to Judy Holiday for her wonderful Born Yesterday, seen today Swanson should have won. From the brilliant opening to the incomparablefending, this movie works on all levels. Masterpiece.Billy Wilder pushed the envelope his films, very daring, for example Some Like It Hot touched upon many themes one of course was Jack Lemmon's character wherein in the end it appears Lemmon and Joe E Brown will end up together.Wilder cast his films brilliantly with stars such as Stanwyck, Holden, Swanson, Monroe reaching new heights under his guidance. Billy Wilder had a bit of a stock company using Holden, Lemmon, and McMurray,over and over. One film that deserves reappraisal is the Kiss Me Stupid with a fine performance by Kim Novak. Other stars that worked for Wilder included a Who's Who of Hollywood: Marlene Dietrich,James Cagney Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Walter Matthau, Paula Prentiss, Henry Fonda, Shirley MacLaine et al.Bravo Billy Wilder"
DOUG-BROWN-2013,"May 1, 2025",10/10,"Between 1944 to 1950, Billy Wilder directed three groundbreaking films, they were Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard.Sunset Boulevard is a classic tale of how old and new Hollywood don't have anything in common with each other.It also makes a powerful statement about the myth of the so called good old days.William Holden is excellent as a struggling writer who finds himself trapped by an ageing silent movie star. His performance in this film, is the best next to Bridge On The River Kwai and Network.Mr Holden who plays the unemployed writer, does a good job telling his story throughout the film.For Gloria Swanson in the role of Norma Desmond, what a great comeback for an actress in a part, that any actress at the time, would have given there eyeteeth to play.Two of the best highlights in this movie, is the cameo from legendary film director Cecil B. DeMille, who unlike Norma Desmond, doesn't reminisce about the so called good old days. He has become an older respected figure in modern day Hollywood, who has moved with the times.The second highlight is the clever writing of the screenplay, which was co-written by Billy Wilder.A must for all movie buffs."
laurenspierre,"Dec 7, 2023",9/10,"As the movie capital of the world, Los Angeles has always managed to capture people's imaginations. This goes all the way back to the early 20th century, when the advent of the big studios brought about the first Golden Age during the roaring '20 and Hollywood became the center of the film industry. Film became in fact an industry, presenting itself as a 'dream factory', selling to the public the idea of the American dream. This industry was built on bonafide stars, good-looking men and women with whom the audience could identify and who, in their pictures, overcame obstacles to achieve success. Stars like Norma Desmond (or Gloria Swanson, for that matter). In selling the public their dreams, Hollywood has attracted many hopefuls in search or their own American dream. People from all over the world with dreams of being in front of (or sometimes behind) the camera, of becoming the next big star and seeing their name up in lights. Up until this day, Los Angeles is a lightning rod for hordes of aspiring actors/actresses or other artistic hopefuls. Obviously, Hollywood itself is in no small part guilty of sustaining its own myth. Most films about 'the movies' perpetuate this romanticized version of Hollywood as a magical place where dreams come true and anything is possible ""if you just want it enough"".Sunset Boulevard, however, takes a somewhat different approach: through the story of a would-be screenwriter and a washed-up movie star, it offers us a blunt examination of the dark side of Hollywood, a cruel industry with a short memory that stifles creativity and ambition and is quick to dispose of its expendables. We follow B-movie screenwriter Joe Gillis, unable to sell his work and struggling to make ends meet. He is ready to go back to his hometown in Ohio, when a fateful incident makes him stumble upon the decaying Sunset Boulevard mansion of faded silent-movie star Norma Desmond. All but forgotten by the movie-going public and living in isolation, Norma is delusional, believing that fans are still longing for her and that she will make a triumphant return to the big screen. She proposes Joe to move in and help her finish the script that will propel her back into the spotlight. Initially reluctant, but ultimately seduced by the comfort of Norma's wealth, Joe agrees and basically becomes her gigolo.With its brutal dissection of an equally ruthless industry, Sunset Boulevard doesn't so much deconstruct the Hollywood myth as shatter it completely. It looks into the gaping mouth of the monster, one that chews up its stars and spits them out whenever it's done with them. Former stars like Norma are abandoned, neglected by studio executives and the public alike, desperately clinging to their glory days and longing to return to the spotlight. Norma roams the ruin that is her mansion like a vampire, a relic of an older time, in search of a purpose in a fast-changing world.This the fate of the lucky few, the talented people who in addition were fortunate enough to once achieve such success. For the other 99%, the common suckers like Joe, who are either untalented or unlucky, Hollywood is simply a place where dreams go to die. They are never even chewed up by the monster in the first place, but rather spit out immediately. In the world of Sunset Boulevard, these are the people that end up on a bus home to Ohio, their heads hanging in shame. Either that or they become gigolos for middle-aged, mentally disturbed former movie stars, one false move away from ending up face down in the pool of a broken down mansion.Gloria Swanson's gloriously outlandish performance is fully deserving of its iconic status in film history. Her histrionics and over-the-top facial expressions are perfectly suited to the (once) larger-than-life star of the silent movie era, Norma Desmond. She gets to deliver classic lines like ""I AM big, it's the pictures that got small."" Or, when Joe suggests that her script needs a bit more dialogue: ""What for? I can say anything I want with my EYES."" The fact that this was a comeback role (sorry, a RETURN) for Swanson, who in real life was one of the grand dames of Golden Age Hollywood and star of many Cecil B. De Mille's films, obscures the line between fact and fiction. This meta-aspect adds a fascinating extra layer of intrigue to her performance and the film's commentary on Hollywood's shameful treatment of its talent. ""Without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio"", Norma Desmond's claims at one point in the film, but it might as well be Gloria Swanson herself speaking.Swanson's flashiest scene (in a movie full of them) comes at the very end, in an epilogue that is both compelling and deeply tragic. As Norma is about to be arrested for the murder of Joe, she has lost all touch with reality and has disappeared fully into her own dream world. The last scene of the film is transcendent. As Norma comes down the stairs, her descent into madness is complete. A look of insanity in her eyes, she stares directly into the camera, addressing ""those wonderful people out there in the dark."" At this point, I got literal goosebumps. Such a chilling ending, utterly devastating, but perhaps also somehow some sort of perverted tribute to the allure of the spotlight and the magic of the movies? In any case, for me it is up there with the greatest endings of all time.Finally, a word on this film's legacy. It is interesting to see how Sunset Boulevard inspired more films to look at Hollywood through this darker, more cynical lens, like The Player, Birdman, or my all-time favorite film, Mulholland Drive. Sunset Boulevard was undoubtedly a huge inspiration for David Lynch. There are little references throughout his filmography (FBI-agent Gordon Cole!), but specifically the parallels with his own magnum opus are remarkable. There are many plot and thematic similarities and even the title is a nod to this film. Most importantly, just like Sunset Boulevard, Mulholland Drive offers a scathing criticism of the soulless nature of Hollywood and the destructive effect that the movie industry can have on ambitious and talented people. The general concept of an (aspiring) actress in search of an illustrious career on the big screen, gradually growing more disillusioned, before finally giving way to insanity, is the same, but being the singular filmmaker that he is, Lynch of course put his own uniquely nightmarish twist on it. With Mulholland Drive, David Lynch pretty much made it a wrap for the 'cynical exploration of the dark side of Hollywood' subgenre, effectively making it pointless for anyone to have another stab at it. However, it is probably safe to say that Mulholland Drive would have never been made, had it not been for Sunset Boulevard (by Lynch's own admission, it is one of his favorite films ever made)."
TRULEIGH,"Apr 23, 1999",N/A,"Much has been said, mostly praising the very trivial exposure-of-true-Hollywood-glamour-emptiness aspect of this great movie. However, the movie deals with some interesting personal psychology as well - or perhaps - primarily.The irony of the Holden character narrowly escaping his harsh creditors only to be much further (morally) indebted in his relationship with Swanson is most funny. He engages in a relationship without true commitment. As the story goes on, he even wants to replace the love he has created with Swanson for the love of a younger woman. The classic fall of the noir male character is elegantly underway.The Swanson character is not evil. The murder she commits is not committed in cold blood, but as a result of the betrayal and lies of people she thought she could trust. I.e. Holden and the too kind director who does not have the courage to tell her the truth about herself.When Holden's true intents towards Swanson are revealed the punishment is immediate, but of course, on her part, well over the limit. The development of his character in the movie is, however, more interesting.I find the ""kill-and-be-famous"" ending of the movie to be a bit unnecessary even for the cynical story. It is true that a murder would probably be the only way for Wilder to convincingly dust off an old star and lead her back in to the fame light. Thus, however, Wilder chooses to prefer the theme about what leads to personal fame to the theme about betrayal of an indebted man and its consequences. The two themes do hardly float together like blood and water, even in a film noir, at least not in this one. It is great, though."

Sunset Boulevard urges us to look at the horrific, tragic realities underlying the  comic, melodramatic, surface of tinseltown, while American Beauty  asks us to discover the traces of beauty-perhaps even the footprints Of God-hidden behind the banality of everyday existence. In short, a wonderfully written, acted, and filmed movie, full of unforgettable, touching, moments."
patryk-czekaj,"May 23, 2012",8/10,"There is a reason why Sunset Boulevard became a sort of defining movie of the film noir genre. It involves ruthless murder, sexual connotations, deceit and failed romance. However, there is difference between this film and other noir titles, which actually made people more interested in seeing Sunset Boulevard. Mainly, Billy Wilder's depiction of a story of a forgotten movie star seemed so real and believable that everyone wanted to experience it from the side of a passer- by. For ages humans were interested in the lives of the rich and famous. And this film presents one of the saddest and toughest moments in the life of a celebrity – the sudden and unexpected fall into the nothingness after years of being on top. Additionally, Wilder gave a very strong and gloomy twist to it, making the movie a real directorial masterpiece.The movie sets a very fast pace right from the start, showing a dead man floating in the swimming pool, as the police arrives at the scene of the crime.Then starts the retrospect, presenting the viewer with a tragic tale that centers on an aged woman, Norma Desmond, who was once a huge silent movies' star in Hollywood. However, with the beginning of the sound era she simply became useless. No one wanted to cast her in the new productions. Yet, she still believes that her fans are writing to her and that she will once again rise and be on the posters all around town.Sunset Boulevard, the address of her house, is a great allegory to her position in the film world. She had her time on the pedestal, but know the Sun has inevitably set on her career and she can't do anything about it. Every day she is struggling with thoughts of a comeback (a word, which she actually hates), but it just won't happen. Only her butler (and first husband) Max is aware of thisSomewhere along the road, completely out of the blue, comes her savior, the screenwriter named Joe Gillis. He is desperate for some money to cover his loans. She is desperate for someone to edit her personally written script for a movie, in which she will also play the main role. Her insanity makes her incredibly jealous over him. She doesn't let him leave and meet other women, even though he is just using her and her money without any feelings. That the story ends in great tragedy mustn't be stressed, obviously. Going deeper and deeper into the madness leads to the final outburst, the 'beautiful' crime. Paradoxically, this is the moment when the cameras start rolling again and she is the main object of interest. And she loves it, like she didn't even know what happened a few hours before.Gloria Swanson definitely steals every scene that she's in. She is marvelous as this old star, who still thinks that she is younger, prettier and more talented than all those young Hollywood actresses. Her fantastic style, seriousness, way of speaking – it all makes for an unforgettable performance. William Holden stressed with this role that he is a marvelous actor and possibly one of the greatest in the 20th century Hollywood.Also, fine use of narration to add to the dark atmosphere of the profoundly calamitous events occurring throughout the movie.All in all, this is definitely one of the movies that are a must see in the history of American cinematography. It shows how thin is a line between fame and obscurity. We don't even know how many of the once-famous characters were suddenly deemed useless and replaced by new generations. It sounds as sad, as it is inevitable."
squirrel_burst,"Nov 20, 2014",9/10,"""Sunset Blvd."" is a classy film noir that threw me for a loop at first. It features excellent performances and is paced well, building up the tension as we see the madness of the strange Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) unfold. Swanson's performance at first seems very silly and over the top, until you realize that due to her silent film career, her speech patterns have become as broad as the expressions she used to convey emotions in her films. She's become this kind of otherworldly figure that doesn't fit in with normal people at all. I guess you could argue that she's the villain of the film and appropriately steals the show, but I also really like the more... sympathetic characters. William Holden and Nancy Olson have great chemistry and it's refreshing to see them on the screen together while the rest of the movie keeps showing off this weird relationship that develops between Holden and Swanson. If you don't know what the film is about, at first you may find it a little slow.

TheFearmakers,"May 17, 2019",6/10,"When much too wordy for a dead guy narrator William Holden tells us about the dark ominous mansion he's happened upon, the direction and atmosphere doesn't match up. He could be walking up to a drugstore in the middle of a busy intersection and it'd be equally as suspenseful.Perhaps the best thing about the outrageously overrated Sunset Boulevard is it's a monster movie and in that, a terrifyingly creepy Gloria Swanson makes up for a bland and overly glib Holden who, outside the main location, has a flirtatious affair with cute ducky-lipped Nancy Olsen as part of a soapy Hollywood-satire melodrama that simply isn't thrilling enough to be called a thriller. And it's definitely not a Film Noir.If anything, Sunset is a satire on Hollywood BY Hollywood with its built-in gripes not very universal: a lot like another Hollywood satire (considered a classic as well) decades later, also starring William Holden. Both are vastly overrated."
Snow Leopard,"Apr 9, 2002",N/A,"Watching this memorable classic is like traveling to a strange and fascinating world.  It succeeds as few movies do at drawing you in and setting an atmosphere that is both convincing and interesting.  The trio of Holden, Swanson, and von Stroheim make a fine combination, and bring their characters to life most effectively.  Aside from a couple of relatively slow stretches, it is crafted with great skill, and it's a film-noir worth watching and re-watching.Holden's restrained, gently cynical performance is an ideal way to look at the unusual world where Swanson's character, an aging former silent movie star, lives.  Swanson succeeds very well at being weird but yet believable, sometimes even sympathetic, and von Stroheim rounds out the picture pretty well as a character with his own quirks.  The physical atmosphere of the decaying mansion and its grounds, done with many well-conceived details, is also an effective and important part of the setup.  It all works so well because it comes across as true-to-life not just as a portrayal of Hollywood but as a generalized picture of living in a bygone era.When you have interesting characters, an unusual situation, a good cast, and a director like Billy Wilder to tell you the story, you have rather high expectations.  ""Sunset Boulevard"" does not disappoint."
Janey-5,"Apr 5, 2002",10/10,"The absurdity, drama & sheer pleasure of this movie are a tribute to a time when movies were golden.  Great acting, great scenery chewing, and some of Hollywood's classic lines -- they're all here in Billy Wilder's sui generis flick.  Why this movie is not on DVD is beyond me!  As far as I'm concerned, EVERY Wilder movie should be on DVD -- especially now that he's no longer with us."
gitrich,"Dec 12, 1998",10/10,"It is rare when a film gives away its ending in the opening scenes but, in Sunset Boulevard it works and works well. Gloria Swanson and William Holden give absolutely riveting performances along with a great supporting cast which consisited of Erich von Stroheim, a devoted butler, Nancy Olson as a sweet young girl who finds herself falling in love with Holden's character and ,a young, Jack Webb as a close friend. This is a movie that I rate a 10. I could find no flaws with it. Rare these days."
mateusolivotti,"Oct 28, 2020",10/10,"Sunset Boulevar is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema and certainly one of my favorite films.The film tells the story of an unsuccessful screenwriter who has a flat tire and seeks shelter in a large mansion that appears to be abandoned, but the owner of the house was Norma Desmond, a big silent movie star who hasn't made a film in twenty years. . So she decides to hire the boy to write the script for her next film.I'm in love with this film, everything about it is incredible, soundtrack, direction, visual and obviously Gloria Swanson's brilliant performance, which I consider one of the best female performances in cinema. For me a mandatory film for everyone who says they love cinema, it is an absolute classic that deserves to be seen. He is certainly worthy of the 11 Oscar categories in which he was nominated."
s-diblasicrain,"Dec 15, 2009",6/10,"I was left with an extremely odd feeling after I watched this film. It left me with this ambiguous and bittersweet feeling and it actually took me quite some time, in which I had to roll it around a bit in my head, before I could figure out whether I enjoyed or detested the movie.The character of Norma Desmond certainly drove me up the wall. I pitied her but at the same time felt an odd disgust. However the huge old mansion that she resided in was spectacular, glamorously decorated and covered with nostalgic photographs of her back in her glory days when she was a silent film star. I think that this more interesting extension of Norma Desmond and her world maybe made her a bit more tolerable."
strong-122-478885,"May 23, 2014",5/10,"Yet, Another Wrong Turn.Now, here's a real piece of over-rated, vintage rubbish if I've ever seen some.And, Yeah-Yeah - I know that Sunset Boulevard (SB), like Citizen Kane, has been praised, since its initial release back in 1950, to the frickin' high heavens by critics and film-buffs, alike - But, hey, it's now 60 years down the yellow brick road, already, and, sorry, but SB just doesn't pass the mileage test as a 'Classic' of movie-entertainment, at all. No, it doesn't.Of course, I really liked actor William Holden as Joe Gillis, the out-of-work gigolo/screenwriter in SB. Sadly enough, in 10 years time Holden would become a chronic alcoholic, eventually killing himself in a drunken fall. Prior to that fateful moment, Holden was, without question, one of Hollywood's most attractive and likable male actors of the 40's and 50's. His presence here in SB can certainly attest to that appeal.But - On the other hand, I totally hated Actress Gloria Swanson, big time. I thought that she was a thoroughly despicable cow. (Moo. Moo.)Ironically, here was Swanson, the frickin' Hollywood has-been, playing just that on screen as Norma Desmond, the aging, Hollywood has-been. About the only diff between Swanson and her character was that Norma Desmond was a certifiable nut-case - While Swanson, herself, wouldn't reach that stage in her career for another 10 years when Alzheimer's finally sent her flying over the rainbow, for good.Back in her early twenties, Gloria Swanson, had once been the paid mistress of producer/politician, Joseph Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was the father of sons, John and Robert, through his mousy, little wifey, Rose.Kennedy had actually financed a number of Gloria's starring vehicles early on in her career. With each one being a subsequent flop, one right after the other, this would eventually seal the inevitable fate of Kennedy's little, hush-hush affair with Swanson, who was an utterly awful actress, indeed, even back then."

These are the painful words from aging actress Norma Desmond as she grapples with fame right after she committed a murder. This phrase is one of the most memorable phrases in cinema's history. Billy Wilder has a knack of making such endings in his movies as evidenced by Some Like It Hot. Sunset Blvd. Is one of the best movies about Hollywood. It tackles a very relevant topic as it deals with fame and what happens when fame run its course. The movie is every bit of a film-noir as it is a comedy. Just like Wilder did with Double Indemnity, he created a movie that thrills at nearly every turn and the relationship between William Holden and Gloria Swanson keeps coming and grabbing you until the shocking ending. You can also classify the movie as a black comedy. Personally, I did not have any belly rolls but rather uncomfortable giggles which is by design. The pet monkey funeral sequence is just an example of one that illicit such giggles. Regardless of the genre, the movie is about as good as it can be. It is a surefire classic and one that cements Billy Wilder's as cinema's most impressive director.Billy Wilder had an eye on a story like this for quite some time. Living in Berlin in the 1920's, Wilder was always fascinated by American culture that was depicted through moving images. He had interest in the star system and the luxurious homes that came with this star system. Two decades later, living in Hollywood, he would think about these homes and ponder what became of the Greta Garbos or the Mary Pickfords of the silent era as many of these stars struggled to continue their careers with the advent of sound and dialogue. People tried to guess, but no one really knew who Wilder based Norma Desmond on. It is likely a composite of different actresses. Of course, with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stronheim being important figures of the era, we see a little bit of themselves. A movie von Stroheim directed with Swanson as the lead is screened for Holden's character. In fact, Wilder made it a point to use authenticity. Cecil B. DeMille played himself. Former silent stars such as Buster Keaton make an appearance. Hollywood's influence is everywhere. It is an age-old theme that is even relevant today as we always see stars who lost their luster years ago try to make a comeback. Wilder's and Charlie Brackett's screenplay is highly intelligent and uses several genres to make a story about characters, young and old, trying to make their way through the unforgiving valleys of Hollywood.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a struggling B-writer who is having problems financially. His car is on the verge of being possessed by creditors. While trying to avoid them, he stumbles upon a mansion of former Hollywood, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Norma lives with her servant, Max (Erich von Stronheim). His job is to satisfy her ego and make her believe she is still loved by the public. Joe takes this opportunity to create a screenplay for Norma's comeback but does not realize what Gloria has in store for him. As he becomes seduced by her wealth, it might be too late to realize just how far he needs to go to satisfy his needs and Norma's needs.Gloria Swanson, a product of the silent era, was one of the few who made peace that her film career ended and went into radio/television. She was superbly intrigued when Wilder approached her with the script. Because of her healthcare routine, she looked really good for her age. I am glad she took the role because she is fantastic. She is a nutcase, but you understand where she is coming from. I am sure I would feel it if I lost my fame because of changing times. Acting opposite from Swanson's star performance is the younger William Holden. Eager for roles since coming home from the war, Holden made every scene count. As he was drawn into the luxurious lifestyle of Norma's, so were the viewers. Erich von Stronheim, originally a director, is mysterious and more than just the personal valet. He is pivotal in the story and when we find out who he really is, the reveal works. Also, Nancy Olson is good as the girl who falls in love with Holden as she wants to start a career in Hollywood herself.Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Sunset Blvd is one of the best movies if not the best movie Hollywood has made about itself. Paramount did not really know what Wilder was making as he started shooting without a finished screenplay and worked the screenplay a little bit at a time. The idea about an aging actress in Hollywood is very similar to another 1950 classic, All About Eve. Both are similar, yet different in their own ways. Of course, they both need to be seen. This is the film-noir version of the 1950 Best Picture Oscar winner. It is thrilling, has some unpredictable twists, and is an important character study about fame and how it can affect people. One of the best endings the movie has!My Grade: A+"
jdoan-4,"Nov 15, 2005",9/10,"Hollywood doesn't produce many effective satires, much less an effective satire about itself. This movie is very effective. I would rank this with ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as one of the greatest satires. Wilder is able to keep a balance between absurd parody and intelligent commentary. He very evocatively portrays the corrupting influence of the Hollywood establishment.All the actors are perfectly suited for their roles. Holden is great as the desperate and ultimately lonely writer Joe Gillis. He is willing to do most anything to keep alive his hopes of becoming a great screenwriter. He remains sympathetic of Norma (as I do), and yet disgusted by her (as I do). Swanson is almost perfect as Norma Desmond. She is grandiose, grotesque, and pitiful. She is able to disguise her true emotion with over-exaggerated melodrama.Several times on the DVD it is noted that Wilder is not considered a great visual director. I think his visuals are above par, and very effective. The scene in which Norma and Joe are watching her silent picture is a good example. She stands up into the projector light with a Gothic, almost surreal appearance. It is as though she exists merely as a two-dimensional projection. In her mind, there is no world outside of the silver screen. The New Year's Eve party is another. There is an overhead shot of Norma and Joe dancing on the tiled floor. You see Norma and Joe all alone amongst the opulence of the house. They really only have each other. As we see, they cannot exist without each other. It is just them and no one else. This is one great movie"

Ursula_Two_Point_Seven_T,"Nov 24, 2006",10/10,"There's nothing I can say to praise this movie enough. This movie is simply the most excellent, perfect movie ever. To give it a 10 is an insult.I've lost track of how many times I've seen this film ... close to 50 would be my guess. How many movies can you watch that many times and the movie remains just as perfect, just as entertaining, just as enthralling and fascinating each time you watch it? Very few, that's for sure!Gloria Swanson was simply perfection in this movie. What a brilliant casting move on Billy Wilder's part! And what a performance Swanson gave. Her theatrics and eye movements were so dead-on ... but then what else could we expect from a genuine mega-star from the silent screen era, playing a faded mega-star from the silent screen era? What a totally unself-conscious portrayal. One of the best screen portrayals ever, in my opinion.Von Stroheim as the butler / former silent director ... again, genius. Erich von Stroheim made some GREAT pictures in his day, I mean VERY GREAT (can you say ""Greed""?), but ended up on the outs in Hollywood thanks to his legendary ego and his battles with Thalberg. How perfect to get a dethroned former major silent director to play a has-been silent director! Remember, it may be de rigeur nowadays for actors to play characters that mock their former selves (a la William Shatner and his newfound popularity), but this was half a century ago when Billy Wilder and Gloria Swanson and von Stroheim pioneered this type of tongue-in-cheek, knowing self-referentialism.And William Holden ... handsome, sarcastic, jaded, sexy-voiced William Holden as the down-and-out writer who turns gigolo. His character is only about 30 years old, but already the Hollywood system has chewed him up and spit him out. He can't even pay his rent or his car loan. His dry, witty, noir-esquire narration of the story adds yet another layer of perfection to this 11-out-of-10 movie.What else is there to say? How does one adequately describe perfection? One does not."
Tweekums,"Dec 24, 2018",10/10,"This film opens with narrator, Joe Gillis, telling the viewer about a 'nobody' being found shot dead in the swimming pool of a once famous film star. We then move back six months and Gillis tells us about his own life. He is a hack screenwriter whose scripts are not in demand; he is behind on his rent and debt collectors want to repossess his car. One day he flees from these debt collectors and turns into the driveway of an apparently abandoned house on Sunset Boulevard. Of course it isn't abandoned; it is the home of fading star of the silent era Norma Desmond and her butler Max. It emerges that she is dreaming of a return and has written a script which he offers to polish, despite knowing it will never be anything other than terrible. Soon he has moved in and she is spending money on him... and he feels more and more trapped. As the story progresses the more tragic Norma appears.This is one of those classic films that one fears won't live up to its reputation but actually exceeds it. It manages to be both tragic and comic with its look at Hollywood's darker side. Norma Desmond is shown to have been one of the great stars of the silent era but now she is virtually forgotten by younger people and pitied by those who do remember her. She is clearly troubled when we meet her but by the end it is obvious that she is mad. Gloria Swanson is excellent in the role. Gillis is no less tragic a character; failing as a screenwriter, becoming a kept man in a claustrophobic environment and when he does appear to be finding real success and love it goes tragically wrong; William Holden captures this character perfectly. There are also fine performances from Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nancy Olsen as romantic interest Betty and Cecil B DeMille in an extended cameo as himself. Having DeMille playing himself could easily have broken the suspension of disbelief but in fact it adds to the feeling of realism. As well as being a good story it looks great; the shots of '50s Los Angeles are evocative of the era and the crumbling mansion perfectly mirrors how Norma's grip on reality is crumbling. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fans of classic cinema."
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Mar 15, 2024",7/10,"Gloria Swanson, what a presence!She dominated every single scene she featured in. I do not know much about her other works; this is probably my first time watching her act on screen, yet I could tell with assuring certainty that Miss Swanson must have been a force to be reckoned with in her glory days as is evident herein as well.What a fantastic performance! It had me invested until the curtains were drawn. I could not get my eyes off of her, nor for a single moment.As for the film, although it didn't fascinate me as much as some of Wilders' other films I have seen before likes of The Apartment or Witness for the Prosecution, I still found myself quite engaged with the story, or rather a character study on the peculiar yet interesting Norma Desmond, a faded star who's too reluctant to let go of her sense of stardom and superiority!It definitely made for an exciting evening watch."
RM851222,"Aug 16, 2015",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Sunset Blvd."" (1950) is simply one of the best movies i have ever saw. That is a brave statement after watching more that 3.000 movies in my life, but after first time seeing ""Sunset Blvd."" only today in 2015, i was blown away by it in every sense.This is a movie making at its very best. The real star of this movie in my opinion was the script. Every sentence in this movie is great, it's lead up to something, and it fully engages you in this movie. The story itself is very simple, yet the script makes it astonishing. There is not one boring or uninteresting line in this movie - this has to be of the most polished scripts in the history of cinema.Acting is superb by all involved, but the best comes from Gloria Swanson. Maybe it is a bit overplayed here and there, but this is how aging and narcissistic movie star from ~ 1930 was interpreted in 1950 - this is superb performance. Music, cinematography, directing - they are first rate here.Overall, ""Sunset Blvd."" is a movie must be seen by all movie lovers. The movie itself is like a love letter to a movies itself and those who loves watching them. All in all, this an amazing motion picture, were everything works and at the running time 1 h 50 min you just want it to continue - it perfectly paced and not overlong. If you haven't seen this gem yet, do your self a favor and see it, don't afraid that it was made in 1950 and it's black and white - this a spellbinding motion picture."
Camera-Obscura,"Feb 12, 2007",N/A,"Although my recent revisit to SUNSET BLVD. must have been close to the twentieth time I've seen it, I'm just as stunned and captivated by it as the first time I saw it. In SUNSET BLVD, everything just clicks, complete with all the now classic taglines; ""It's not me that got small, it's the pictures that got smaller."" ""We didn't need dialog. We had faces then."" ""I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr. DeMille."" I can't think of any other picture about Hollywood - or the world of film in general - that has achieved this unique self-reflective look at the film community. Ironically, none probably could have dreamed of the magnificent performance Gloria Swanson turned in. At barely 5 feet tall, she commands the screen like no-one else and really towers above them all as Norma Desmond, the aging, completely delusional film star from the silent era. Hard to imagine Gloria Swanson wasn't first choice to play the part of Norma Desmond with Pola Negri (too much Polish accent), Mae Murray, Mary Pickford (too sweet) and even Mae West all considered for the part of Norma Desmond.The movie opens with the bullet-riddled body of a young man floating face down in the pool next to a mansion. Soon, the story is told with the brilliant device of a voice-over of a dead man, Joe Gilis (William Holden), recounting the events leading up to his death. A broke screenwriter, down on his luck and desperate to take on any job, he stumbles upon what looks like a deserted mansion, when he's hounded by some creditors. Soon, he's ordered into the house by a female voice that turns out to belong to legendary silent screen star Norma Desmond who retreated from the outside world, now living a lonely and isolated existence with her aging servant (Erich von Stroheim). After some lamenting the current state of the film industry, she offers Joe a job of doctoring her script for SALOME, which she plans as her comeback vehicle. Clearly this is never gonna happen, but Joe decides to take the job, and he money, but soon becomes a virtual prisoner of the actress's creepy past and increasingly delusional dreamworld.Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is. After the death of Norma Desmond's chimpanzee, Holden acidly remarks; ""This must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King-Kong perhaps."" ""And then the rains came, over-sized, like everything else in California.""This film closed the door to the old Hollwyood-generation, opened one to the new and basically started a new era in self-conscious film-making and - in the process - reconciled the until then completely forgotten silent film stars. Of the three directors featured in the film, Cecil B. DeMille was still well respected and would make some of his greatest films in the years to come. Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while. It's quite outstanding how the cynical Wilder achieves to really make us care about the characters, all of them, but especially Norma Desmond's, whose oblivious outlook on the world surrounding her and her own long since gone fame (Von Stroheim writes her fake fan letters) really makes you pity her fate.With the right ingredients, the right script, the right casting, Wilder was able to achieve phenomenal results. Needless to say, he made a whole string of films now considered classics, but this is the pinnacle of his career and head and shoulders above any other self-reflective turn Hollywood embarked on in all the years to follow. If forced to make a shortlist of ten films I couldn't do without, this one's on it.Camera Obscura --- 10/10"
gsygsy,"Jun 28, 2007",10/10,"A recurring theme in Billy Wilder's work is the price we pay for opportunism. It haunts Jack Lemmon's C.C. Baxter in The Apartment; it is life's blood to Kirk Douglas' Chuck Tatum in Ace in the Hole; it is ironic in Stalag 17, in which William Holden's Sefton, the most opportunistic of the prisoners, ends up as the most heroic. Before all these comes Holden's Joe Gillis, whose nemesis is one of the most terrifying and glorious of all screen goddesses - Norma Desmond, incarnated by Gloria Swanson in one of the greatest ever movie performances.Swanson obviously was, to some extent, the character she portrayed: she had been one of the biggest of Hollywood names, had faded from public view, and was, in this very film, returning, as her alter-ego was attempting to do. But there the resemblance ends. With every step that Norma takes to the madhouse, Swanson moves further towards greatness. They can make the story over all they want - add songs, reshoot it frame-by-frame (someone'll undoubtedly try one day). It won't matter. Swanson will never be outrun. She knew the prototypical Norma Desmonds first hand. If things had worked out differently she might have even turned into something like one. But in the end she poured her knowledge and experience of a unique moment in artistic history into a character that could only have been created then (when sound in movies had been around for only a generation) but, through the imagination of Wilder and Brackett, became something bigger, more powerful, absorbing the weak in her wake. And that brings us back to Holden's superb turn as the spineless Gillis who, through the intercession of the splendid Nancy Olsen, finally sees the light, and dies for his insight.Writing about it, it becomes clear that this is a piece of work that transcends its time and place to join the real classics of drama. Totally brilliant."
Flups21,"Aug 22, 2013",10/10,"Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was.It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime.Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time.They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate.This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are."
blackburnj-1,"Jul 8, 2009",10/10,"Billy Wilder's haunting and masterful tale of possession and fallen glory remains one of the most iconic, entertaining and disturbing films ever produced. It's focus on the great lost generation of silent films stars and its unforgiving look at the cut throat and fickle world of Hollywood is chilling and, at its heart, are two magnificent performances from William Holden and, especially, Gloria Swanson as the reclusive, fallen star, Norma Desmond. It is a work of utter genius reflected by its oft quoted lines (""All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close up."") and memorable visuals (the body floating in the swimming pool).The story of the chance meeting of down on his luck writer, Joe Gillis, with the former silent movie star, Norma Desmond, is brilliantly written (the film was a deserving recipient of the Oscar for screenplay). Gillis is an unscrupulous and seemingly hopeless dreamer, out of money and out of time. Desmond is similarly hopeless, but tragically so. She is not the architect of her own despair, but has been abandoned by everyone and yet is determined that she is still desired and loved by the ""millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen"". She sits in a Kubla Khan as detailed and as haunting as Citizen Kane's, protected by her mysterious butler (an effective Erich von Stroheim, who later dismissed his part in the film as ""that butler role"").The treatment of Desmond is distressing, and Gillis joins the fun, leading her on and taking her money, before he suddenly realises that he is trapped. Gillis is not as inhuman as he perhaps needs to be to follow the road he has started on and he is, thus, doomed. He cannot leave Desmond, who will undoubtedly kill herself in despair and is unable to write the script that may make him or be with the women he loves. The villain is Hollywood and its cut-throat and unforgiving nature which is brutal on its people and impossible for a man with the smallest slice of conscience.This was a brave film for Wilder to make, not so much biting the hand that fed him but cooking it in butter and serving it to the dogs. However, he got away with it and no wonder why. Even the hardest man had to step back and acknowledge the brilliance of craft, the harshness of wit and power of storytelling in this film. It is brutal, dark and excellent in every way."
Lucabrasisleeps,"Feb 11, 2009",7/10,"That's how I felt about the movie overall. Certain aspects of the film seemed dated. But there are many aspects that are quite relevant too.It has an interesting premise. A struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis(William Holden) starts living with an old star of the silent era Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson) in order to write a screenplay for a movie she wants to act in(which is supposed to be her big comeback). Joe is amused by Norma's behaviour. She still lives in an illusory world in her mansion where she is still a big star. Her faithful servant Max Von Mayerling also feeds her ego and keeps telling her that she is a big star. Norma begins falling in love with Joe and gives him presents in order to keep him. The movie then follows Norma's degeneration and the final over the top conclusion. The situation of old actresses who were stars in the past is very well portrayed in this movie. The dry humour and sarcasm in this movie is also an aspect that raises it above the other classics of the Old Hollywood era. It can also be seen as a satire of the Hollywood system. The scene where the director tells his assistants not to call her again - the same director who had once promoted her heavily - is a sad scene which shows the fleeting nature of showbiz. The portrayal of Norma's obsession with Joe is also excellent. The way Joe gillis uses the opportunity to his own advantage is also quite funny in a sad depressing way.The attitudes of the people reveal a somewhat dated attitude that doesn't quite fit in today. The scene in the shop where the shopkeeper says ""Well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicuña?"" shows a somewhat derisive attitude towards a woman having a ""trophy man""(while the opposite has been accepted). The attitude of Joe Gillis also seems dated. He behaves as if he is embarrassed that an older woman is interested in him. The line ""I had to be with people my own age."" shows the derisive attitude he has towards Norma's love towards him. I felt that the movie was a bit behind the times in these aspects. The ending was also a bit too over the top for my liking.The performances are top notch. The laidback acting style of William Holden is complemented by the over the top performance of Gloria Swanson. The over the top performance was appropriate in this movie, I guess. In many scenes she even seemed cute when she proclaims that she is one of the biggest stars. There is a likability to her character even though she seems a bit unhinged throughout. Nancy Olson is gorgeous and she is adequate for the role. Erich Von stroheim is very good as the faithful servant Max and it is surprising to note that he wasn't a professional actor while doing this film. Cecil de mille's cameo is actually quite good.I liked the movie but felt that the movie seemed a bit too dated for my taste. It can be taken as a stinging critique of Hollywood that is relevant even now. The dated aspects prevent it from becoming a great movie though.7/10"
sjanders-86430,"Jan 22, 2021",10/10,"Gloria Swanson is only 50 when Sunset Boulevard was filmed. But she's a has been even though she looks great. Cecil DeMille much older than she is still working. The script cuts the Hollywood glamour to a number that says young actresses only. This film should have won Best Picture, but the Oscar Board didn't give it, because the whole film industry was shown for the cruel town that it really is.
William Holden should have won an Oscar and didn't. Gloria Swanson should have won an Oscar and didn't.
I have one criticism of the plot. The locks had been taken off the doors. Under the careful watch of Von Stroheim, how did Swanson get hold of a loaded gun?
I loved when Von Stroheim played the organ with those white gloves he never took off. I loved when Gloria played Charlie Chaplin. I loved when she and Holden watched her silent films. The Isotta Frachetta car they drove around was also wonderful.
Swanson's walk down the staircase with the lights, cameras rolling, and of course us sitting in the dark watching captures the core of all Hollywoods' glory and tragedy. She let the dream enfold her says Holden the narrator from beyond the grave.
Billy Wilder used narrators in his films, because it saved time to have someone explaining things."
efren_aa,"Nov 12, 2017",6/10,"Let me start this review by saying that this is a good movie. The plot works on various levels with different interpretations and an actual focused theme. It's not just a love story, it's an honest Hollywood depiction, it's a meditation on fame and time. Good work there! The movie, though, presents some important flaws. Most relevant the off- voice, which was distracting at the beginning and honestly very on-the- nose sometimes, not centered in giving feedback or highlighting a concrete point, but rather there as a lazy job on the director's part. Swanson's performance (what an appropriate name!) is borderline unwatchable by the way."
Chuck-149,"Sep 18, 1999",9/10,"After reading my summary, I know that some of you that are fans of Jose Ferrer are going to write some bad stuff about me and what I've said which I do expect.  Only hear make sure you know what I mean when I say Holden was robbed.  I'm not saying that Ferrer wasn't good in ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", I'm saying Holden was a lot better in ""Sunset boulevard"".  The reason I'm saying this is simply because throughout the movie, you think that there is no William Holden in the movie, that there was simply Joe Gillis playing himself through the whole movie and I'm not just talking about his acting, but his look and the voice-over especially, made you think that Joe Gillis made a movie about a part of his life.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a down-and-out script writer who owes everybody some money, especially his insurance company which has had enough of waiting for him to pay and threatens to take his car if he doesn't pay on that day.  Naturally, Joe doesn't pay and decides to leave town for a while to let things cool-off.  But as he is leaving, he runs into the men from the insurance company and so they run after Joe on a road that leads far out of town and luckily for Joe, as he is in a rather sharp turn, he hits a nail and drives his car directly into a lost driveway losing the boys from the insurance company.Joe has no clue where he is.  In fact, he thinks he is in an abandoned house's driveway.  But as he approaches the garage, a man comes out of the main house claiming that ""Madame"" is expecting him.  Joe doesn't know what the man is talking about but enters the mansion as he is asked to and follows the man upstairs where he meets ""Madame"".  Now being a script writer, Joe recognizes ""Madame"".  She is in fact the star of the silent movies, the great Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson).  But Mrs. Desmond thinks that Joe is the undertaker who is there to bury her dead monkey.  Joe explains the misunderstanding and asks if he could just borrow a spare tire and he would be on his way.  But Mrs. Desmond refuses because she wants Joe to polish off the script she has written and that she wants to show to Cecil B. DeMille so he can direct it.  And so her servant Max (Erich Von Stroheim) shows Joe to his room and he begins to work as a gigolo for Mrs. Desmond.Masterfully directed and acted, this is one film-noir you won't want to miss.  Personally, I felt that Holden and Wilder did a better job with ""Stalag 17"" but ""Sunset boulevard"" is still an American classic.  It was good to see Gloria Swanson back in action again.  She was very good looking in this movie and played her part very well.  But it is really the Holden-Wilder team that makes ""Sunset boulevard"" so good.  The movie leads to a great ending and the filming is excellent during the whole movie.  It's one of my favorite movies made by the great Billy Wilder and starring the exceptional William Holden.  This one you really don't want to miss."
Artimidor,"Dec 24, 2011",10/10,"An audacious look into Hollywood film making and its victims ""Sunset Blvd."" is a film about obsession, opportunism and the rise and fall of stars and writers as cogs in the remorseless movie making machine of the Hollywood dream factory. The great Billy Wilder as the director, William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim as the principal actors, get their point across so brilliantly in a movie about movie making that it hurts. One of the reasons why it works so well is that ""Sunset Blvd."" is fiction placed in the real Hollywood, where references are explicitly sought, not hidden: Star director Cecil B. DeMille plays himself, ""movie zombies"" of times past like Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have roles equivalent to their importance as movie stars at the time the film was shot, even former celebrated actor/director Erich von Stroheim pretty much plays himself. This lends the film authenticity and weight, sometimes a comedic or an unabashedly cynical touch, but more often revealing shockingly tragic insights in an all too common parallel universe celebrities use to live in - insights that have not lost any relevance to this day: Once caught in a dream world it's difficult to see through the haze of glory and notice that impending doom is just a step away...It was an audacious concept of Billy Wilder to target the film industry within its own medium, right there at those very sound stages where usually the blockbusters were made to rake in the big money and produce celebrities on conveyor belts. The direct assault that ""Sunset Blvd."" represents for sure did NOT get Wilder the Oscar for Best Picture of 1951. Well, this one has survived them all nevertheless and turned into a timeless classic. It's a film that transcended the Hollywood machinery - well informed, impeccably written by Charles Brackett and Wilder himself, full of verve, innuendo and dark humor, directed with technical proficiency and sense of great storytelling. An ultimate film-experience in the literal sense."

dcombs6365,"May 15, 2019",6/10,"This picture takes the happily-ever-after myth of Hollywood stardom and shatters it for good. When talking pictures became the standard virtually overnight, the big studios turned their collective backs on most of the silent icons that had helped build them. This film offers a frequently sympathetic view of the descent of one of these icons into despair and madness - and for silent film buffs, offers a rare opportunity to see the likes of Anna Q. Nilsson and Buster Keaton in speaking cameos. This film greatly pushes the limits during a time where the code ruled over Hollywood. A Real trend setter"
cbentrott,"Nov 22, 2020",6/10,"This film has robust, story-telling dialogue but leaves something to be desired at the end. The acting was commendable, but I left confused at the motives of each of the characters."
alekspredator87,"Sep 27, 2025",5/10,"""Sunset Boulevard"", directed by Billy Wilder, is a story where cinema itself becomes stage, actor, and audience all at once. Strange as it may sound, that's exactly how I see it. The plot follows Joe Gillis, a young, not-so-successful screenwriter who finds himself drawn into the closed-off, increasingly unsettling world of Norma Desmond-a once-great star of the silent era, long since forgotten. While trying to solve his own problems, he ends up trapped between nostalgia for the past and the hopelessness of the present.Released in the middle of the last century, the film seems to divide Hollywood into ""before"" and ""after."" This is no longer the naive, luminous cinema of the early years. Instead, bitterness comes to the forefront-characters adrift, boundaries between good and evil dissolving. Perhaps it's just my impression, but Sunset Boulevard feels like a turning point, where studio glamour begins to crack, and through those cracks emerge raw human dramas. The movies grow darker, more complex, more ambiguous.At the heart of the film is not a clash of good and bad, but the coexistence of the broken and the lonely. Joe is a writer who doesn't want to be a kept man, yet cannot escape it. Norma is an actress stuck in a past where she still reigns as a goddess of the screen, even though the industry has long abandoned her. Max, her butler, is absurdly devoted, building illusions of stardom just to keep her from collapsing entirely. All three are trapped in their own worlds, and none of them inspire either condemnation or blind sympathy-only compassion. The actors embodying this trio are excellent: William Holden, Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stroheim-each performance is filled with tension, drama, and raw nerve.Shot in black-and-white, in a style we often associate with the classics, the film nonetheless reshapes what ""classic"" means. This is cinema where the charm of old Hollywood collides with an unflinching look at its shadows. Wilder's direction is precise-merciless, even-in how it underlines the tragedy of each character, gradually building tension and leading the viewer to a strong, emotionally honed finale. It's the kind of ending that doesn't let you go. And never will.The film was rightly celebrated by critics and the Academy, winning three Oscars-for Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Score. It received eleven nominations overall, including Best Picture, Best Director, and acting nods for all three leads. A pity none of them won. At the Golden Globes, the film triumphed with awards for Best Actress in a Drama (Gloria Swanson), Best Director (Billy Wilder), Best Score, and Best Drama of the Year. These honors only underscore how significant this film truly is.In the end, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is strong, gripping cinema, leaving the aftertaste of true drama-not sweet, not bitter, but real. For me, it was a worthy film. I wasn't exactly blown away, but I deeply appreciated the craft of everyone involved. A solid ""good.""7 out of 10."

filipemanuelneto,"Nov 16, 2022",10/10,"This movie is really special. Not only does it show us a lot about the world of Hollywood during its golden age, but it also reveals a lot about the actors' egos, vanities and their titanic struggles to preserve their careers and stay in the limelight. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, it is considered by many to be one of the great movie classics, combining entertainment, artistic value and cultural relevance. In 1951, it won three Oscars (Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction in a Black and White Film, Best Comic Film Soundtrack) and could perfectly have won one more, for Best Actress. But awards like these are never completely fair, especially in years so fertile for good films.Starting with the iconic scene of the dead man in the pool, the film intrigues us, and curiosity grips us, as the film shows how it all happened, introducing us to an average screenwriter who struggles to write a successful script that can leverage his career. He owes money, is in serious trouble and takes advantage of the opportunity to earn some easy money at the expense of a retired silent film actress, who decides to hire him to revise and type a script, written by herself and designed to mark her return. The script is mediocre, and he knows that the film will never happen, but he is coerced into silence, becoming the privileged eyewitness of the former star's gradual loss of lucidity. Of course, things get complicated as he loses his individual freedom and becomes more dependent on the whims and desires of his mistress.Despite the fiction, the film is based a lot on several loose true facts: one of them, the most obvious, is the fall of several actors in the course of the transition from silent to talking films. There were great actors who looked magnificent on screen and had great physical and facial expression, but who didn't survive this transition due to things as prosaic as a poor English fluency or a strange accent. Others, however, simply did not know how to understand and adapt to the novelty. The collapse of their careers and personal lives led to alcoholism, drugs, mental disorders. The film is able to condense almost all of this into a single character: Norma Desmond, the epitome of the fallen star.The cast has several well-known names, three of which - William Holden, Erich Von Stroheim and, obviously, Gloria Swanson - offer us the interpretation of their lives and their work of greater value and recognition. Of course, we cannot ignore that Swanson was a great star of silent cinema and that she shone in films like ""Trespasser"" or ""Indiscreet"", and that Holden would continue to be a highly sought actor after this, having won his Oscar for Best Actor in a film that starred two years later. But there is no doubt that this film immortalized the three of them.Technically, the film is impeccable, and the merit lies a lot in the brilliance of the dialogues, in the excellence of the conception and development of the characters, in the extraordinary way in which Wilder managed to get the best out of Swanson and lead the actress to a magnificent performance, which has so much to brilliant and difficult as well as provocative (especially from the point of view of many Hollywood shooting stars, who saw themselves in character and felt offended by it). With an excellent pace, the film does not waste time or let the atmosphere of tension and drama fall into a standstill. The mansion, owned by the Getty family, acquires character by itself as it becomes the most obvious symbol of the disturbed personality and only of its resident. The black and white cinematography is magnificent, and accentuates, in its details and shooting angles, the dramatic feel of the film. The soundtrack isn't memorable, but it's effective and functional."
carolajayisavon,"Sep 7, 2020",6/10,"It's worth a watch but nothing out of the ordinary, at the beginning you see the end and as you watch the film you keep thinking how did it end like that. It was interesting through out was not bored at all. What brings the film to life is Gloria Swanson who is a scary crazed woman she acts this beautifully. She brings the movie to life its worth watching only to see her. Not a bad film but nothing great, cannot give it more than 6. But throughout wondered if it would have been better in colour, there were so many scenes i am sure would have been better in colour."
avik-basu1889,"Oct 27, 2014",9/10,"This is the third Billy Wilder film I have watched after Ace in the Hole and The Apartment. After watching these 3 films, it is quite clear to me that unlike most films of that era, Billy Wilder's films used to have substantial and thought provoking messages underneath the basic plot and Wilder loved to visually voice his opinions about the different strata of contemporary society. Ace in the Hole was an uncompromising and dark study of the media and its effects on society ,while the The Apartment was a comedy with subtle commentaries on corporate/office culture. Sunset Blvd. is a film which shows the dark side of the film industry. How cutthroat this profession can be and how quickly actors and directors can become obsolete if they fail to adjust to the dynamic nature of the business. The film revolves largely around Joe Gillis,a struggling screenplay writer and Norma Desmond, an arrogant and scarily delusional former Hollywood star of the silent era. Norma finds it difficult to accept the fact that her days of stardom are behind her and the film industry and film directors no longer care for the actors from the silent era. In order to hide from the current film industry which she considers demeaning and abominable, she has completely isolated herself from the world and deliberately caged herself in her lavish and extravagant mansion where she still is a celebrity. When she meets Gillis the screenplay writer, she thinks that he can help her finish a script which she has written on her own for a film which will be her grand comeback. Gillis looks at this as an opportunity to get money out of Norma and get some respite from his financial problems. But slowly he finds himself trapped in this mansion with no freedom (which is a metaphor for the film world and how it allures and then traps people with dreams of making it big). This fatal partnership in the end leads to devastating and diabolical conclusions for everyone involved. While watching the film, I became certain that the character of Norma Desmond must have inspired and influenced Satyajit Ray to create the character of Huzur Biswambhar Roy for his film Jalsaghar(The Music Room). Like Norma, Biswambhar who was once a respected zamindar was also arrogant and separated himself from the world, a world where aristocracy was slowly fading and giving way to modernism. But while Jalsaghar was a poetic and musical masterpiece which oozes empathy and the essence of humanism, Sunset Boulevard had a dark,neo-noirish feel about it. Billy Wilder uses a lot of metaphors and symbolism. The dream about the monkey dancing for pennies, the drawing of the curtains, the rats in the pool, the limelight falling on Norma for a few moments before being taken away,etc. all these metaphors will be very meaningful to the discerning viewers. The acting is marvelous. Gloria Swanson is fantastic with her over the top and extremely dramatic representation of Norma Desmond and William Holden's realistic acting provides a good contrast to the larger than life Norma Desmond. But the only thing that didn't work for me was the melodrama in some scenes. There were a few moments which felt too unrealistic and melodramatic,especially the scenes involving Betty Schaefer. But overall this is a chilling commentary on the film industry, the miserable plight of old, forgotten actors and the glitz and glamour of the movie world which can lead to delusions. The film ends with catastrophic consequences. But the final scene has to go down as one of the greatest scenes in all of film history. That final scene is poetic, profound and yet filled with immense horror."
ohlabtechguy,"Mar 1, 2018",6/10,"Am 58 and just saw this on TV. Very familiar with William Holden and have heard of this movie, but just now watched it. It's sad that this former silent movie star, Norma, is clearly mentally ill and had been for sometime. But the movie is not about mental illness. Norma is portrayed more like an older, wealthy, eccentric, former movie star that just can't let go of her dream of being forever young, forever loved and forever a relevant star. Because her illness goes unrecognized and therefore untreated, she carries out a horrific act at the end and then we get to see the full extent of her illness as she enters the realm of nonreality and pretends to be back in the studio being filmed. Just really sad that in 1950, this was how they viewed mental illness - just eccentric people who didn't quite think and act like everyone else."
Calysta,"Jan 13, 2000",10/10,"The film industry obviously did not know what had hit it when Billy Wilder's masterpiece was released in 1950. Fifty years later, such mastery in craftmanship still shows by still being fresh and alive, evident from the first of the unforgettable reels when William Holden's character, an unknown writer, is lying face down and dead in the pool of an extremely possessive star of the silent screen.Although not my favourite of Billy Wilder's works, (""Witness for the Prosecution"" is my own special favourite), this was not actually the first time he had stirred Hollywood. ""The Lost Weekend"", a film more scarce in its circulation but just as brilliant, had five years before almost lost a release because the type of slap-in-the-face reality was something audiences were unused to. And it eventually went on to be the best picture of 1945. However, by casting light on an industry still even seen today as the perfection of life, the Paramount studios caused an uproar from coast to coast.One of the more interesting contenders at the Oscars ""Sunset"" had that year was ""All About Eve"". The Bette Davis/Anne Baxter film did eventually take the coveted prize best picture prize, but it is obvious that ""Eve"" too runs along pretty similar lines, but instead of shattering the myth about the golden days of the silver screen which went for the throat, the 20th Century Fox executives gave it a gentler shape by provocatively going after the theatre.Haunting music and even the black and white cinematography made me feel I was in for a special ride as the opening credits rolled. William Holden was in one of his best roles. This movie unfortunately made Gloria Swanson be better remembered by us as the tragic aging movie queen of the silent era, who was one of the many actors and actresses who phased out as the sound picture experiments became a sensation. Featured also are Erich von Stroheim as the first husband turned servant and Nancy Olsen as the young girl writing collaborator. All four received Academy Award nominations, though none won. Cecil B. De Mille, one of the great directors of the silent era puts in an appearance on the featured Paramount lot as himself.The screen play, as in all great Billy Wilder movies, is gripping and fiercely brilliant. Just some of the emotions captured on film, and some of the darker imagery has made it one of the best films of the 1950s, and one of the best movies in Hollywood history. ""Singin' In the Rain"" may have made it better known to us with the use of colour, dance and song, but it did not even go anywhere near ""Sunset"" despite the bitter sweet sensation the musical gem leaves.Deservedly so, this cinematic genius is first rate.Rating: 10/10"
poppinginnocentyears32,"May 10, 2006",N/A,"Few filmmakers dare to open the curtains to the public on what really takes place beyond Hollywood's glitter and glamor as Billy Wilder did with SUNSET BLVD. Unforgettable performances, effective visuals, faultless, inventive direction and a biting, comical and melodramatic screenplay make this a legendary film on filmdom.Joe Gills' (William Holden) corpse is seen floating in a swimming pool while his off-screen narration recalls his dangerous professional and personal involvement with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and the events leading to his demise. Joe, a B-movie screenwriter, inadvertently winds up at a decaying mansion, where faded silent film-star Norma takes residence with her faithful butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim). The insane Norma has certainly past her prime but she mistakenly believes she can achieve a ""return"" as an actress again. Joe wishes to leave but when Norma insists that there will be serious cash involved, he takes on a job offered to him as an editor of her defective, self-indulgent screenplay. At first, Joe, who is now obliged to live with Norma, is treated like a gigolo, having every one of his needs catered. However, when Joe secretly co-writes a script with the attractive level-headed Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma takes extreme measures to assure herself that she is a star who will not be abandoned.Wilder productively creates the eerie, dreamlike and surreal atmosphere in the beautiful black-and-white images of the crumbling mansion and the wicked, wraith-like characters. Nevertheless, not a single characteristic of the film seems fabricated or fictitious. Its sense of realism is undeniable. Many can relate to Desmond - rejected by Hollywood after years in front of the camera. Another unusual yet valuable aspect is its sense of humor and ability to laugh at itself. Even the most famous lines in the movie are both heartbreaking and amusing, intensifying the illusion that Norma has forever been a superstar.Gloria Swanson is exceptional in her magnum opus and most memorable role as the purely malevolent, manipulative Norma Desmond, a woman stuck in the past. Gloria, herself, was a silent movie queen of her time and had been missing from the silver screen for 16 years. Now, it is unimaginable to picture anyone else as Norma. Though less remarkable, William Holden is excellent as a skeptical screenwriter knowing Norma won't be able to attain the star-status she once had. He has moral flaws of anyone walking down the street but he slowly becomes the likable protagonist. Just as competent is Erich Von Stroheim who plays the silently sadistic butler, who guarantees Norma that she has always been the celebrity that she thinks she is. The final major character is ingénue Betty Schaefer played by Nancy Olson. Her composure and calmness is a pleasing contrast to Norma's irrationality.SUNSET BLVD. is really a black comedy-satire with a sardonic, derisive screenplay, film-noir with perfect direction and character-driven drama with terrific acting all together. Though most significantly, it is a painfully captivating work of art and a candid peek on the fickle world of showbiz and its devastating effects."
abel_posadas,"Jun 4, 2004",9/10,"Billy Wilder and Charles Bracket got the definite ghost story about Hollywood broken dreams. There's something vicious about the place and, on the other hand, this movie means the end of an era: Hollywood up to 1950. That year means, in my opinion, the last curtain for the so-called dream factory. And in that dream Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis become crazy. She becomes a fiend and he a pimp. The horror is that after 1950 Hollywood would never be the same and we can say that it's the end of the modern era and the beginning of postmodernism -what with the idiocy of the 50's era-?

kyle_c,"May 31, 2002",8/10,"""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered to be one of the quintessential Hollywood films.  It takes a bitingly satirical look at what makes Hollywood work. However, beneath its surface it is more than just that. It's a uniquely strange look what happens to a prima donna who's fallen from her high horse.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a young, down on his luck Hollywood writer. He's just scraping by, trying to hide his car from repo men.  He winds up in the house of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging silent film star who is working on her comeback screenplay.  She gives Joe the job of fixing the screenplay, although her aim is basically to have him for company.The characters are well formed and incredibly well acted, specifically in Joe and Norma.  They are three dimensional - each has their own internal struggles and desires.  Joe, on one hand, relies on Norma to keep up his good life that it has, but on the other hand wants to go out and be with the girl that he loves.  Norma is stuck in the delusion, kept up by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), that she is still famous.Holden and Swanson perform their parts brilliantly.  Holden is the man trapped, with no way out.  Swanson overacts, intentionally, saying every line with such grandiosity that she perfectly captures the way Norma feels about herself and her perceived stardom.This movie is about a woman who was once great and has fallen.  She reacts to it not with acceptance, but an unconscious denial.  She, along with Max, has convinced herself that she is still a star with legions of fans.  Joe keeps up the charade because of everything that he is offering her.  The idea of the middle aged woman keeping the young man for company is genuinely strange, but it fits the picture that Norma is trapped in the past, and fails to move on, but rather deny it.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a brilliant movie.  It works on two levels - as a satire about the hollowness of fame and Hollywood, and also as a look at what happens when one has fallen from grace.  Its status as one of the greatest movies of the era is certainly well earned, and it has certainly survived the test of time.**** out of ****"
Irecken,"Jan 9, 2002",10/10,"Gloria Swanson and William Holden are supreme in this hard look into the dark side of Hollywoodland. Gloria Swanson as the insane Norma Desmond, a mad silent movie star languishing in her old mansion surrounded by reminders of her glory days, and William Holden as a bitingly cynical screenwriter playing gigolo to Swanson while carrying on an affair with nice reader Nancy Olson is great. The other scene-stealer is Erich von Stroheim, who plays Swanson's fromer husband and director, and now her butler."
RetroStylistic,"Apr 18, 2003",10/10,"Sunset Boulevard was absolutely amazing to watch again given the fact that it was made some 40 odd years ago and still holds up as a very modern film whose commentary on Hollywood is still right on.  Gotta love Gloria Swanson for having the balls to take on this role, given the fact that she was, at this point, a faded star in real life.  William Holden is magnificent, the kind of man's man that never seem to be onscreen nowadays.  Just to have Von Stroheim and DeMille in a film playing themselves is a trip in itself.A tribute to just how amazing Billy Wilder was.  They'll never be another quite like him."
Kubris,"Nov 14, 2011",10/10,"IMDb Top 250: 32I'm going to get this out of the way: it's hard for me to formulate coherent thoughts about Sunset Blvd. If you haven't yet seen the score, I loved it. LOVED it, like one of the few 10's I award love it. But it's a difficult film to describe, you simply have to experience this one-of- a-kind masterpiece.Sunset Blvd. follows hack (love that description) writer Joe Gilles, in the gutter, as he finds himself in the lap of eccentric silent star Norma Desmond, who is planning a comeback (""It's a RETURN! I hate that word"") and wants Joe's aid. In a sentence, the film shows that relationship. But it's so much more than that. You see right from the start, beginning with very cool credits, it's also a murder mystery to constantly think about. It's also famously a look at Hollywood, post- sound transition.Where to start? The acting. Our narrator and protagonist(?) Joe is the cool, straight man in this odd tale, but like everything, he isn't a perfect person. His performance is however. We're never sure what side of the game he's playing, but he sure looks like he does.Joe may be the protagonist but Norma Desmond is the star. Up until today, if someone asked me to name an amazing female performance, I couldn't. But Gloria Swanson, in a role much like her life (minus the crazy) fully realized this intriguing character. She's a woman who can't let go of the past, someone unable to look forwards. we all know someone like that. And her ""development""- she's a silent star alright.The whole thing has a creepiness to it, and I can draw several connections between this and 'Psycho'. Creepy isn't quite the word, 'queer' is a little more fitting. But it's unsettling, and a large chunk of that is Max, Norma's butler. His constant presence is freaky, his loyalty scary. Erich von Stroheim, a silent director, is perfectly cast in this role, even if he didn't like it much himself.It's remarkable how this echoed real life. Gloria Swanson plays a character who mirrors her own life, and is accompanied by one of her former directors. Cecil B DeMille, famed director, plays himself. Numerous other cameos happen as well, include one of my favourite scenes, where Norma plays bridge with other silent stars, namely Buster Keaton, who actually speaks. It's as though this really could've happened, these people really lived among the stars of the day.A film about writers has to have good writing, and Sunset Blvd. delivers in script, cinematography, and all technical aspects of film. The mansion is extravagant, a worthy choice for the Set Design Oscar. Also the music, while not iconic or even having a main theme, wonderfully plays along with the film,adding the extra level to a magnificent film.The plot wraps up eventually, and if you didn't know it was coming from the start then it would be a very strange finale indeed. All I'll say is it puts the narration in a different perspective, and the film scene (and line) are strange, creepy, and just excellent.There you have it, my glowing response to Sunset Blvd.There's only one thing: I can't identify a genre. A drama is too broad, a noir would be a little off, and it doesn't quite fit the bill to be a thriller. But maybe that's the spark that makes the film so great- there's nothing quite like it, and while it's timeless, there probably never will be anything like it again. 9.6/10"
aute123,"Mar 24, 2010",7/10,"I may be alone in my review of this Gloria Swanson, but I thought she was absolutely horrendous in this role. I don't recall seeing anyone overact the way she did in this movie. Every word seemed to be the most important word ever spoken. How she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Roll for this movie is beyond me. I think many actresses from that time period, including Joan Crawford, could have done a much better job.Holden, as an actor and narrator, did a great job as usual. I also thought the movie was a little too long. And Erich Von Stroheim, nominated for Best Supporting Actor also did a good job."
Niro,"Oct 26, 1999",10/10,"For me this is Billy Wilder's [and likely Holden's] finest work, which is saying something on both counts.  And Bill was robbed of the Oscar for this remarkable performance.The only flaw in the entire film is one which echoes ""Citizen Kane's"" sole error ~Sunset: How can a dead man narrate a film?Kane: How can a dying man utter a word [""Rosebud""] in an empty room, and yet have the entire film revolve around friend and fellow newsman Cotten's search for the word's meaning?  I mean, no one actually could have heard him say the word.  Don't believe me?  Watch the beginning again ~ the nurse walks in after Kane falls down he stairs.Immaterial.Read everyone else's review of this film, because it's all been said here.It's a tour de force on every level, and not just for the [now cliched] line: ""I'm ready for my close~up, Mr. DeMille,"" nor for the fact that the past~her~prime Gloria Swanson agreed to play a has~been [unheard of at the time. even though Swanson was never really an extraordinary Hollywood figure].The kicker for me is that the extremely important early German expressionist filmmaker Erich Von Stroheim actually lowered himself to play Swanson's [Garbo~based?] character's butler/assistant, helping to keep her legend alive.This is akin to Martin Scorsese playing butler to average actress Kelly Preston 20 years from now.Holden, as the penultimate gold~digger/gigolo [albeit unwittingly at first], is simply brilliant.  As is the forever underrated Nancy Olson as his wannabe screenwriter mentee.  Despite her first~rate work here, she never appeared in another masterpiece again.Our loss.William Holden did, of course, and a case can be made for his performances in ""Bridge On The River Kwai,"" ""Stalag 17"" [Wilder again], ""Picnic,"" ""Network"" etc.But for me this was his career's defining role.10 of 10 [and #6 in my US Top Ten Films]"
sevisan,"Sep 5, 2006",7/10,"Billy Wilder always liked the obvious and easy things. For instance, Jack Lemon is the ""middle American everyman"", Marilyn is the dumb girl, Stanwyck is the blonde wicked vamp, Stroheim is ""one of the three grands directors of the silent era"", Swanson disguised as Chaplin, etc. His films are often overwritten (lines like ""next time I'll write ""The naked and the dead"", ""who wants to see a film about the civil war?"", etc.). ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a typical Wilder film, full of obvious and overblown things like that, but is a film that it gets better as the decades pass by, I don't know exactly the reason. It is a film that is ""so bad that is very good"". Perhaps in ten years, another awful ""wilderiana"" as ""The big carnival"" (almost worse than SBoulevard) will be also redeemed by its campy flavor."
smakawhat,"Jun 17, 2000",9/10,"This movie is so prophetic that it amazes me.  It showed how much Hollywood has turned into a monster by chewing up people and spitting them out like yesterdays newspaper.  It seems little has changed.Gloria Swanson as the star who has been, is flawless in her role.  At times you hate her for her arrogance, then Wilder makes you feel pity for her when you find out that all the doors in her 60+ room mansion have the locks removed so that she can't lock herself in a room and take her life.The butler also does well as he atempts to shield her from the reality of her cruel world, by writing letters that she thinks is fan mail.Wilder did such an impressive job with this film, even including actual actors in the 50's at the time (even including director Cecil B Demille as HIMSELF) to play roles.  The scene where she returns to the studio and an old stage hand shines a light on her but then only for a fleeting moment. We all remain in the spotlight in the centre of attention, for only a short time.Brilliant filmRating 9 out of 10"
Boba_Fett1138,"Jan 19, 2010",9/10,"There are quite a few movies out there are about life inside of Hollywood. These pictures particularly show the dark and downsides of this strange world of its own. This movie is full with references to Hollywood, as it's a story about a fading star from the silent era who meets up with a young struggling script writer.The movie has a quite interesting story, that builds on its great characters. It's a greatly cast movie, that features Gloria Swanson, an actress who more or less gloriously plays herself in this movie. She herself was an actress during the silent movie era and actually hadn't appeared in any movie for 9 years before singing on for this movie. The movie is filled with some casting like this. For instance Erich von Stroheim plays a once great director and Cecil B. DeMille appears as himself in this movie, in a quite big talking role. It's also the movie the well known line 'All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up' comes from The movie truly benefited from its great and smart casting.It's a real character driven movie, in which more and more becomes obvious about the female lead, who is slowing loosing her mind and sense of reality because she is in full denial about her fading career and glamorous stardom. Its mostly were the movie its drama is coming from, though of course there is a whole lot more going in this movie. The writer William Holden also has his own issues and there are a bunch of more different story-lines and characters that the movie involves.It's really pleasant that this movie is a fast going one. Unlike many other movies from the same time period this movie rarely has slow or dull moment in it. Yes, it's a drama but it's one of those dramatic movies that also still is really pleasant to watch.It's simply a really done well movie. It had a a great story to work with but having a good story is of course one thing, having a great movie is a totally different thing. It's no big wonder that this movie worked out so great, since it had Billy Wilder at the helm of it. He does not only tell the story great and with lots of pace but also makes the movie with a lot of eye for detail. It's also a movie with some good looking sets and costumes for instance, though initially these are not really the things you will notice first.A great movie about Hollywood done by some of Hollywood's biggest.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
gigan-92,"Oct 13, 2011",10/10,"One of the first films to truly shed light on the true nature of world behind cinema was Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950). It was already the tendency of film noir to be rather bleak in its portrayal of human nature, but this movie almost seemed to point the gun at itself. Despite a few critics, the movie is hailed for its uncompromising tale that of which concerns the two leads, William Holden as the out-of-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis and the fallen star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. The grisly story that follows is one of desperation, deceit and of course twisted love. The film achieves this thru its ominous film noir style-cinematography and well done characterization.As the story progresses, it crushes and grinds her dreams without a second glance. The real side of the Hollywood Star System is that actors and actresses all have specific niches, and once that role has been completed and used up, their use usually comes to an end. After a certain extent of glamour, no matter how beautiful the reign, it can never really last forever. The film also displays the cold reality of the world, through the natural tendency of human beings to forsake others. Only in madness, did anyone turn their cameras back on Norma Desmond, and only in death did anyone truly miss the one-shot writer Joe Gillis.Not only that, but the love story between him and Betty Schaefer (played by Nancy Olson) ends rather sadly, before he even meets his own more pressing tragedy. As always in film noir, fate is cruel and seemingly random. It is thru the beautiful cinematography and shadowy characters that Billy Wilder uncovers the truth of a world that before had seemed purely idealistic and welcoming."
kenhe,"Apr 18, 2004",10/10,"I really enjoyed this film because of its realism.  The seamy and unclean underside of ""Hollywood"" is given flesh and blood by both William Holden in his calculating manipulation and Gloria Swanson by her cold, grasping desperation.  The technique of telling the story from the viewpoint of William Holden's character, who has already paid the price of his cynicism and greed, was so effective as to be priceless.  What was best, for me however, was the sympathy that both the lead characters managed to evoke in spite of their obvious and outrageous flaws.  What could be more realistic, pitiful, but superbly tragic than the butler writing phony fan letters to his faded star employer?  The fact that Sunset Boulevard was filmed in black and white I believe added to the power of the acting and the effectiveness of the narrative in the sense that it lent a grimy aspect to what was truly a dirty little story of personal failure. I also believe that because it was in black and white, I was never distracted by the scenery or the beauty of the sets and I was able to concentrate on the central aspects of the acting of William Holden and Gloria Swanson and the story they were portraying. This was one of the greatest movies of all time!"
SnoopyStyle,"Mar 12, 2016",8/10,"Joe Gillis (William Holden) is found shot and floating in the swimming pool of a Hollywood mansion on Sunset Blvd. Six months earlier, Joe is a struggling screenwriter trying to sell his run-of-the-mill movie to producer Sheldrake but script reader Betty Schaefer belittles it. He's on the run from repo men and he hides his car in an old mansion. The mansion's owner turns out to be silent era movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She has delusions of making a 'return' to star in her script of Salome for legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Joe sees an easy way to make some money doing a rewrite. Slowly but surely, he becomes her kept man.Gloria Swanson gives an iconic performance for the ages. Her scenes on the Paramount lot are riveting. William Holden is great. It's a fascinating dissection of Hollywood and the fame obsession. There are a few moments of over-acting by some of the other actors which is weird since the movie is about the passing of the silent era acting. Norma Desmond has to be one of the top characters of all times."
MST3Kfan1966,"May 28, 2002",10/10,"This picture takes the happily-ever-after myth of Hollywood stardom and shatters it for good.  When talking pictures became the standard virtually overnight, the big studios turned their collective backs on most of the silent icons that had helped build them.  This film offers a frequently sympathetic view of the descent of one of these icons into despair and madness - and for silent film buffs, offers a rare opportunity to see the likes of Anna Q. Nilsson and Buster Keaton in speaking cameos.  Billy Wilder's genius as a director is evident in the way that the very adult relationships among the principal characters are conveyed perfectly, under the yoke of the Hays Code, without the use of nudity or profanity"
g-96059,"Apr 25, 2020",7/10,"In 1950, sunset strip won a golden globe for the aging gloria swanson for best actress. Prior to this, swanson was a famous actor in the silent era of Hollywood, almost like Norma Desmond in the film, but with the arrival of sound films, their aura gradually faded and they were slowly forgotten by fans, who were only trapped in the luxurious old houses of Hollywood, showing the films they had been in over and over again. So the film 24 times per second lie (at that time should be 16 lattice) is no longer for the audience, for those who have been out of the studio, lose box office appeal (also means that the audience) yesterday as well as movie stars, they stubbornly immersed in their weaving a dream is not willing to wake up, is cruel, everyone else is awake."

Certainly Erich von Stroheim knew he wouldn't ever be able to make 20-hour epics any more, and the parallels of his character and that of ""Norma Desmond"" make this film doubly poignant. Even Cecil B. de Mille manages to put in a passable performance as himself (has any other director managed to do this?)."
dbdumonteil,"Aug 7, 2001",10/10,"Generally considered as Wilder's peak,it lives up to its reputation.Fifty years later,it remains the best movie about movie world,not only hollywoodian .One hundred times plagiarized,never surpassed. First of all,there 's the Swanson/Von Stroheim couple.He directed her in the famous ""Queen Kelly""(another must of the silent movies).Von Stroheim was too ahead of his time,his movies scared the censors ,so he was not allowed to pursue a career that would have been stunning in the talkies.Here he became (supreme downfall),Swanson's butler ,while we see one of his former colleagues,Cecil B. De Mille,playing his own role,still directing.Von Stroheim's character is called ""Max von Mayerling"" ,probably one of Wilder's private jokes: Stroheim once said he was the son of a lady in waiting of Austrian Empress Elisabeth (Sissi) whose son Rudolph committed suicide in Mayerling!And Wilder was Austrian too. Swanson is impressive too.The comeback myth is the dream of every actor whose star is slowly but inexorably fading.that she continues viewing her old -and real!- triumphs like ""Queen Kelly,that she's writing an extravaganza shows that her comeback desire has reached the point of no return and that her only place in this world is the asylum.What Swanson did not achieve in the movie,she did it for real:she really could come back(as Lilian Gish),her performance,particularly in the last scene ,has stood the test of time. Wilder as a scriptwriter outdoes himself here;lines like ""I'm still big;it's the pictures that got small"" could be pronounced today ! 25 years later,he would try to update ""sunset blvd"" with ""Fedora"":the latter suffered by comparison,but it's a very worthwhile work that every fan of this great director should see."
Cinemayo,"Jun 10, 2004",10/10,"I think this picture was definitely more deserving of ""Best Picture"" of 1950 than ALL ABOUT EVE. Probably it was the more ""offbeat"" nature of this film in those times that worked against it, much like THE EXORCIST didn't have a chance of winning Best Picture in 1973 (I think THE STING and even American GRAFFITI were better, though). A magnificent film, with great direction by Billy Wilder, and a fine cast. Gloria Swanson initially struck me as way over the top and wild-eyed at first, but given the whole nature of the proceedings, it's kind of understandable. William Holden is perfect as the desperate house guest, and Nancy Olson is the ideal girl-next-door. Eric von Stroheim is striking as Swanson's butler. A keeper that I'll seek out for myself on DVD, I'd place SUNSET BLVD. as one of the best films ever made, and it will occupy a position in my personal Top 100. **** out of ****"

A down-on-his-luck screenwriter, desperate for cash, is taken in by an aging film star who has a deal he couldn't refuse.  Thus, begins this complex tale of love and desperation, courtesy of Billy Wilder and Co. Swanson is eerie and sympathetic in her portrayal of Norma Desmond.

wisewebwoman,"Oct 17, 2001",9/10,"I have seen this movie perhaps 10 times and it never fails to get to me on so many levels.  The jaded newsman played by William Holden, the star herself, Gloria Swanson who just about steals every scene she is in, William does an excellent job in holding his own.  This is the ultimate comment on Hollywood by Hollywood. And it holds true even today when we observe so many has beens behaving so inappropriately (Goldie Hawn, pushing 60, giggling like a crazed 15 year old comes to mind) because they cannot let go of their days in the sun and keep projecting their younger selves to us as they have not come to terms with the people they have become. My heart aches for Gloria in this, though she is most unlovable and treats people abominably. The old bit players shine in this also, and of course Eric who continues to worship her because he knows no other life but that of sycophant.  A great, great movie. 9 out of 10 ( And I was so disappointed in the stage remake a few years ago.  Nobody can top Gloria."

Its movies like this that make me wish I would have given it a go even if I ended up as a regular extra. I met a lady online who roomed with Farrah Fawcett and knew many of the actors and dated some of the most famous actors sons.

johnglaza,"Jun 14, 2024",10/10,"After 50 years of watching Sunset
Boulevard, It is one of the few films that still holds up. William Holden is the foil for Norma Desmond, played beautifully by the imitable Gloria Swanson. Erich Von Stroheim, as Norma's first husband and current butler, is wonderfully directed by Billy Wilder and his crew. Mr Wilder was the chief writer, ably assisted by Charles Brackett and D. M. Marsgman Jr. In the end, it's the screenplay that holds up. The Writer's Guild voted it the 6th best screenplay ever. Much the Same for Budd Schulberg's script in On the waterfront. The writers are the key. Smart writer's don't do sequels once they've achieved perfection."
willab-04386,"Jan 16, 2019",7/10,"I've heard the name Sunset Boulevard repeatedly over my life, but I hadn't seen it until now. Since I'd heard it heralded as a classic, but didn't know much about it, I was excited to see it, and it was an interesting film to finally watch. However, I found it a little difficult to get invested in the film since neither of the main characters seemed particularly sympathetic to me. This made some scenes feel dull or unappealing to watch because I didn't really care what happened to the characters. That being said, most scenes were still interesting, and it was still fun to see a ""classic"" old film."
csdcsdcsd2003,"Aug 15, 2025",7/10,"I've seen Sunset Boulevard twice, my viewings decades apart - the phoniness of Hollywood, the eager hopes of Unknowns arriving there from Wherever, as well as the fading glory of Silver Screen stars - it's all here, all overwhelming, sad and futile. This 1950 Sunset Boulevard captures Hollywood's mournful essence throughout, even with the gutter-level opening moment announcing where we viewers have arrived - on one of its best-known streets. We start at the bottom, a street sign at the curb and dead leaves, and then we move to the pool complete with a 'talking' corpse. The opening was, at first, to have started with William Holden (Joe) as a corpse on a slab conversing with another corpse in the morgue but the test audience found that so hilarious that the Big Wigs changed the opening so we meet dead Joe literally all washed up in Hollywood. So what's sardonic B-picture writer Joe talking about? Down-and-soon-to-be-out Joe should not have trespassed into a 1920s Hollywood residential palace but he did, and, like an ill-fated fly, immediately gets stuck in the relentless web of the owner, the vainglorious middle-aged actress Norma Desmond who bitterly compares her golden olden Hollywood to the inferior mess it has become. Dwelling on the past, her past, pushes her toward madness. Golden Boy William Holden doesn't have much to do here except wear tuxedos and sit on her chaise reading books while the fabulous Gloria Swanson does almost all the heavy lifting. Her incredible face shifts like magic as her crazy ideas spew forth. Nancy Olsen, a new starlet at that time, played the third component of this lopsided triangle. Dragnet's Jack Webb is one of many familiar faces of the vast supporting cast. It's a movie worth seeing - hard to swallow, impossible to forget and doomed from the start. Kind of icky all in all."
m-santana,"May 8, 2010",N/A,"This movie was crazy! It's an actresses nightmare. The story was beautiful because it had taken just an innocent man in financial troubles and put him in a situation were basically he sold himself to the devil in exchange for nice things to surround himself with. It's quite a mouth full. Poor Norma didn't know what to do with herself; old and out of work. Although, she was snobby and completely into her non existent career I couldn't help, but feel bad for her. There was an odd balance in the movie because it felt realistic and really unreal at the same time. The camera portrayed Norma's zanny, needy qualities very well. The lighting in the end particularly symbolized the star she once was that may always last through her movies, but it also enlightened what her stardom had made her became. It's just crazy what fame and money can do to people. The movie was very enjoyable to watch never a dull moment."
mr. sardonicus,"Sep 5, 2000",10/10,"I thought I had seen all of the important movies made during the past fifty years, but somehow I had missed Sunset Boulevard. I had seen parodies of the characters and was familiar with the story line, but I was really not prepared for this gem. Wow! When it comes to great acting, it just does not get any better. I really couldn't care less about the film's commentary on Hollywood; I watch this film to be mesmerized by Gloria Swanson. The premise of a kept man is creepy enough, but Swanson really takes this movie to another plane. If you have never seen this classic, do yourself a big favor and rent it. You will enjoy every minute. Very few movies can be called perfect, and this one may not be, but it is awfully close."

HuntinPeck80,"Nov 4, 2024",10/10,"Unite the feminine principle with the rot of insanity and what have you got? The most frightening thing in existence. Also maybe the most visually compelling.This legendary film is sensationally good. It has a deadpan humorous narration by principal actor William Holden. It has a mouldering mansion worthy of Great Expectations. It has the macabre musical styling, when needed, of early Strauss (Salome), and it has an anti-heroine who is like Salome and Miss Haversham combined. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). The final minutes of this movie will cast such a spell on you, fill you with such fascinated terror, you won't be able to look away, no matter how hard your mind begs you to. Hell hath no fury, etc.I can see now where Diane Wiest found her inspiration for the part she plays in Bullets Over Broadway (1994). Her role was a dramatic actress trapped in a farcical production. But Gloria Swanson is playing a dramatic actress locked inside an illusion, who refuses to wake up. What will happen when she gets a shot of reality?Only an hour and three quarters. How much could be learned from Sunset Boulevard, if only todays 'the message kids' had the sense to watch it? Oh yes, Sunset shows us they existed then too. But there was more love in the world back then."
whpratt1,"Nov 7, 2003",10/10,"The first time I viewed this film in 1950, I was spellbound, even though it was in black and white, just seeing a man floating in a swimming pool face down in a dead man's float, had me wondering just where this picture was going to take me.  William Holden(Joe Gillis) ""Picnic""'55 I had seen before in other films.  Gloria Swanson (Norma Desmond) ""Airport""'75 kept me wondering why she was so attracted to Joe Gillis, who could have been her grandson in this picture.  After seeing Erich von Stroheim (Max von Mayerling) ""The Mask of Dijon"" '46 who gave a very strange performance as a butler, housekeeper and who was madly in love with Norma Desmond along with acting like a Nazi and her personal film director. I just wondered how the story was going to turn out in the end. Billy Wilder brought back to the screen in 1950, great Silent film stars with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who was an assistant director to D.W. Griffith, ""Birth of a Nation"".  Gloria Swanson was a famous actress and after this film, her career took off once again, with Films, Television and many business ventures.   When Billy Wilder made pictures, they all became great CLASSICS for all generations to view and enjoy."
caa821,"Aug 4, 2006",10/10,"Like many things, some movies can be described as a ""whole which exceeds the sum of its parts."" This film is one of those - and ""parts"" can reference both the general description as in the term, as well as those ""parts"" played by the cast members. Gloria Swanson overplays her character (nothing new for Ms. Swanson), as one would expect from the faded, silent-screen, delusional actress she portrays - and in view of the fact that overacting was more prevalent in the era during which this picture was filmed, especially those in the film noir genre. However, Gloria not only chews the scenery like an avid beaver, but like a whole colony of them. Erich Von Stroheim looks as though at any moment he will be joined by Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. William Holden (outstanding in so many roles, from ""The Moon is Blue"" and ""Stalag 17"" onward), and Nancy Olson, make June and Ward Cleaver, or the Bradys, look like deep, mysterious couples. But in spite of all of this, the movie is, as a whole, interesting and fascinating, not just when viewed as it would have been contemporaneously, but as a true relic of a film now over a half-century old. Whether this is because of - or in spite of - the performances is the question to be answered. I believe it is the latter, but whichever, it is well worth seeing."
nutsy,"Oct 22, 2003",10/10,"Billy Wilder's classic SUNSET BLVD. is probably Hollywood's best self-loathing look at itself. William Holden is great as a struggling screenwriter running from his creditors who encounters has-been silent film star Gloria Swanson (who is pretty much playing herself in the guise of Norma Desmond). Her tragic character and her decaying palace of a home are very heavy and very dark, the kind of thing that only a great comedy directer like Billy Wilder could give us. Erich Von Strohiem appears as Swanson's butler who was a silent film director (as the actor was in real life). The truth of these performances is part of what makes the film's statement about Hollywood so delightfully bitter. Watching this film will prove to anyone that the hype and reputation are entirely justified. The film viewer of today can appreciate the connection to David Lynch's supposed homage MULHOLLAND DR. about another dark tale associated with another L.A. street. See both films, but see this one first."
Horror-yo,"Nov 24, 2017",7/10,"I would like to preface this review by stating I fully realize that as a person of the contemporary times my conception of pace and story development certainly conditions me to favoring a swifter more fluid progression in a film's plot. So older films will often tend to feel a bit slow. But then again ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the top films I've ever seen despite being 5 years younger than this and about 20 minutes longer, so the point here is there's no excuse for something perceived as a flaw, not its time not anything.During some stretches the film will lack a bit of content and could've been filled with more intricacy when the narrative is clear enough to the viewer. All in all, it's obvious what the director is conveying during each section from the very start of the scene, it appears the film could've benefited from perhaps 15min less with more effective playtime. The conclusion also leaves something to be desired and contributes largely to that notion of being too self-explanatory and a scene which point is too obvious from the start. The Norma Desmond character is probably overplayed a tad (especially towards the end), which further contributes to that obviousness factor and pushes the movie towards looking like a movie rather than genuine and subtle.Of course it's still a very good film - especially if compared with the films of today it feels like a masterpiece of rare occurrence. It's strong in plot, psychologically intriguing and well crafted with several interesting developments (rather than feeding off one single idea) and the narration is just superb for about the two thirds of it before dropping to a more normal level in the last part.7.5/10."

jolieschu,"Nov 26, 2017",10/10,"This is a wonderful movie. I say this for a few reasons; the different characters you meet during your time watching each seem to have things to say about the state of Hollywood at the time. Although some of the commentary could carry over into criticisms of the same Hollywood today. I would even argue that some of the things the main actress expresses from the beginning to the end: could speak to some of the affects of Hollywood on child actors.One of the driving forces of this movie is the actions and behaviors of the former silent screen actress, that ultimately collide with the realities of the changing world. I feel this movie has a lot to say that you may not be able to catch with the first sitting alone. While it's not the kind of movie i'd recommend to relax to after a long day, it is an excellent one to watch.I promise an impression will be left on you after watching this; and some of the jokes are better understood if you have seen your share of older and a few silent films.

It criticizes Hollywood in a very strong way, a way that leaves an impact on the viewer.To give you a general idea of the plot: it follows Joe Gillis, a troubled Hollywood writer who's drowning in debts. As he runs away from the finance company he finds himself in a rather large mansion, being hired to fix a screenplay for a long forgotten Hollywood star Norma Desmond.As I've written above, this film is one painful criticizm of Hollywood - how it worships moneys instead of art, how it casts away anyone who isn't needed anymore, how it kills good writing. I think that esepcially in the final, haunting scene, the critcizm was evident and strong. It is said that Gloria Swanson just burst into tears after filming this scene, and I can definitely see why.Sunset Boulevard has many strengths - Swanson's acting gives so much life the Desmond's character, the score is on point and adds a lot to the film (especially during the opening sequence and during the final scene), the layers of criticizm here (both through the plot as an alagory and through the actual casting) are quite brilliant, and I appreciate this film a lot.I can't say that I have any big issue with this film, or any noteable one. I like it a lot, and I appreciate it even more.So, if you wanna get a creative, layered look into the cruelty of the film industry, Sunset Boulevard is definitely the film for you. I can't say that this film shook me to my core or that I had a really high emotional connection to most of it, but the ending is phenomenal and it is a very smart and interesting film to watch. I'm feeling an 8.6/10 on this one."
Handlinghandel,"Sep 5, 2005",9/10,"Deservedly a classic of American movies. It holds up in spite o the ongoing parodies on the Carol Burnett Show, which sank some lesser movies. (Maybe they were homages as well as parodies.) A very dark movie, with everything right ion place. Holden is excellent, though at times his voice-over narration is a little arch. Swanson is fascinating. (What could this possibly have been like with Wilder's original choices -- Mae West for Norma and Montgomery Clift? Clift would have been good but West, much as I love her, would have sunk it.) Holden's interest in Nancy Olson has never quite made sense to me. She is attractive and appealing but her wholesomeness breaks the mood. That may have been the writer and director's intention. If so, I'd call it misguided. But who am I? Bill Wilder is one of the finest directors this country has ever known and I do not propose to second-guess him."
JT-20,"Sep 12, 1998",10/10,"I had two friends in college whose movie opinions I took seriously.  I asked them both which movie they thought was most ahead of its time.  One said Citizen Kane (predictable) and the other said Sneakers (laudable but borderline dubious).  My vote goes to Sunset Blvd.  This movie would eventually have been made, in another era of Hollywood -- even Altman was praised for The Player, but it was pretty much a metaphysical takeoff of Sunset Blvd.  And, honestly, who doesn't want to be William Holden?"
Bernie4444,"Jul 24, 2024",9/10,"""Life which can be so minuscule had taken pity on Norma Desmond. The dream she had clung to so desperately had enfolded her.""Movie scriptwriter Joe Gillis found himself in the sunset of his career. While escaping auto preprocessors, by Accident or Fait he turns into a driveway on Sunset Boulevard and begins a new chapter with a mysterious actress who is in the sunset of her career.This play in three acts is packed with stars of the time. Many of the Stars and the writer reflect their real lives in the story. I am not going to bring up a list because they are fun to discover as they show up on the screen.Even though the movie can hold its own and is worth re-watching, be sure to get a DVD with the audio commentary. The commentary helps you see what you are watching; it also covers the original beginning of the movie.I have been tainted before viewing this movie by watching the Carol Burnet version."
ldeangelis-75708,"Sep 10, 2024",9/10,"It's a dark story full of less-than-pleasant characters, but nevertheless this is a film not to be missed! How many movies start out with a story that's narrated by a dead man? Right away, you can't help being fascinated and wanting to know more!This movie is an abject lesson in what two careers to avoid: movie star and gigolo; one robs you of your sanity and the other of your life.Bill Holden is all cynical excellence in his role as Joe, the boy toy of has been star Norma Desmond, with Gloria Swanson playing that role as if she were born for the part. There are plenty of famous faces here (Eric von Stroheim, Jack Webb, Fred Clark), some playing themselves (Hedda Hopper, Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner) which add to this offbeat, slightly macabre masterpiece.Two things stand out in my mind (aside from the unforgettable finale, where Gloria gave an award-winning performance). One was where Bill outdid himself in an understated yet dramatic scene, as he explained to the girl he loved (played by Nancy Olson) why they couldn't have a life together. Rather than put it in words, he showed her his expensive watches and cufflinks and closet full of designer suits. That said it all.The other was where Joe tells Norma words that every aging celebrity should take to heart: there's nothing wrong being 50 as long as you don't act like you're 25. Too bad these Peter Pan (or so they think) celebs don't listen.Don't miss this one!!"
Falko_h1,"Jun 14, 2024",8/10,"""Sunset Boulevard,"" directed by Billy Wilder, is a classic film noir that delves into the murky depths of Hollywood's golden age. This 1950 masterpiece stars Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent film star yearning for a comeback, and William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling screenwriter who becomes entangled in her delusional world.The film's strength lies in its compelling narrative and rich characterizations. Swanson delivers a tour-de-force performance as Norma, capturing the tragic desperation and faded grandeur of a forgotten star. Holden's portrayal of Joe is equally captivating, embodying the cynicism and moral ambiguity of a man caught in a web of ambition and despair.Wilder's direction and sharp script provide a scathing critique of the Hollywood dream, exposing its superficiality and the ruthless nature of fame. The film's dark, atmospheric cinematography and haunting score enhance its eerie, melancholic tone.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a poignant, incisive exploration of the price of fame and the inevitable passage of time. Its timeless themes and unforgettable performances make it a standout in the annals of cinema, a must-watch for any film enthusiast."
lcrews,"May 3, 2011",10/10,"Billy Wilder had a long and much-honored career as a director. He made some of the best light comedies of his or any other era, but his best and most essential films pushed the boundaries of Hollywood at the time. From The Long Weekend's devastating look at the reality of alcoholism, to the frank discussion of changing societal norms in The Apartment, to making Holmes and Watson homosexual lovers in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Wilder was always breaking new ground in what could be shown on the big screen.Sunset Blvd. may be his crowning achievement in boundary pushing, just because it is one of the most savage attacks on the mythos of Hollywood ever created. He spares no expense to bite the hands that feeds him, digging way deep beyond the glamor and into the reality of stars, former stars, and wannabes. The casting is dead-on, with Gloria Swanson and Ericj von Stroheim in particular--they had both been eaten up by the Hollywood system some time before 1950.Sunset Blvd's self-reflexive deconstruction of Hollywood myth would be enough by itself, but it's actually just one layer of many in a truly great film. It's also a fairly gripping detective story, downright funny in moments, and absolutely horrific in others--Swanson's famous ""I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Demille"" in particular can still send shivers down your spine. Besides being one of the all-time great directors, Wilder was a hell of a writer who collaborated with some of the best screenwriters in the business; his long partnership with I.A.L. Diamond is legendary, but this is the last of 13 collaborations with Charles Brackett, who brought just the right amount of pathos and tragedy to the script, no doubt aided by his experience working behind the camera in Hollywood for years.If you are a film buff or a student of Golden Age Hollywood, you will likely add Sunset Blvd. to your list of all-time greatest movies, but you don't have to be a film student to enjoy it either. It's dramatic, funny, chilling, and really just a joy to watch unfold. Many great films of the late 1940s and early 1950s are still enjoyable to this day, but even the best of them can seem somewhat dated today. Not so with Sunset Blvd., which is as potent and stunning as it was in 1950. One of the all-time best films, Sunset Blvd. is highly recommended viewing."
Italy-Wedding,"Apr 29, 2001",10/10,"it's a great film, especially the performance of Gloria Swanson is great. One of her last great films. Also the role of William holden is great. I think Gloria SWANSON deserved the award for best actress. I will see this great film!!!! YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM."
Spleen,"Mar 20, 2002",9/10,"The corpse floating in the pool, was, so far as I could recall, the very first thing we saw; and the first thing we heard was the narrator casually mentioning that HE was the dead man in the pool, and this was his story...Not so.  There's a little bit of scene-setting before we even see the corpse, with the narrator chatting away, seemingly with no particular aim; and by the time he gets around to using the word ""I"", which lets us know that this is HIS story, we've already cut to a flashback, which makes it quite easy for the viewer to miss the implied point (which is not, in the end, all that important) that we're listening to the words of a dead man.According to Otto Friedrich's ""City of Nets"", the original script's opening scene would have left us in no doubt.  Wilder had planned to show us bodies lying around in a morgue, with tags on their toes; suddenly, a few of the bodies would sit up, and start swapping stories about how they died.  Then Joe would get around to telling how HE died, etc., etc.  Apparently nobody liked this gruesome prologue, and Friedrich himself professes relief that Wilder's associates managed to talk him out of it.  I think the original prologue was a WONDERFUL idea: its brash insolence could only have helped the film.  Oh, well.  The more muted, inexplicit opening Wilder went with in the end is still a remarkably strong one.The film that follows is an enigma.  You've got to love the haunted mansion (haunted by a star of the silent era who is very much alive, even if her career is dead), and the sharp chromatic ditty that forms the basis of Franz Waxman's score, which worms its way into our heads and then NAGS us about something, although it's hard to say what; you've got to love seeing Wilder at his most visually eloquent (he may have been better with words than images, but he still had a better grasp of what to do with the camera than most directors), working with a script that manages to convey heavy fatalism while leaving us in constant doubt as to where it's going to go next. Perhaps the only reason I feel this falls JUST short of being Wilder at his best is that I can't even tell where it got to in the end.  Is there a moral?  It FEELS as though there is - but what is it?Don't believe anyone who says that this is some kind of Hollywood exposé. We know how dull THEY are...  The exposé element turns out to be a trivial part of the overall picture, anyway.  A brief, almost casually included conversation with Cecil B. DeMille reveals that Norma was driven mad not by anything that happened recently, not even by the years of neglect, but just over twenty years earlier, at the height of her success - and it was the excesses of the silent-era star system that did it.  The more muted Hollywood of 1950 Wilder depicts may actually be a healthier place.Or it may not be.  It's not the film's concern either way."
imt206,"Apr 12, 2003",10/10,"As someone who works in this industry, I know what it does to a person, and also what people will do to make it.  That is the story of Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis, one who has reached the pinnacle of success in Hollywood, only to have to have lost her youth and beauty and forgotten; and another who is struggling at the bottom to make it and will do just about anything to achieve that.That parallel is what makes this movie so genius.  Norma Desmond is one of the great characters in cinematic history, and Gloria Swanson does a phenomenal job portraying her.  I had only seen Gloria in silent films previous to this, and was doubtful of her ""speaking"" abilities, but she just absolutely nails this role.  I cannot imagine anyone who could have done this better than her.  Especially that end scene, where she does that eerie dance down the stairs and raises her eyebrows and walks into the camera. Absolutely Fantastic!Although William Holden was amazing, I kinda would have liked to have seen how Montgomery Clift would have pulled it off.  I think what was appealing about Monty was that sensitivity and vulnerability he portrayed, and I think that would have worked very well in this role.Other than that, the casting was perfect.  Erich von Stronheim was excellent, and what is scary is that he used to be a up and coming director in the 20s.  Nancy Olson had that innocent, wholesome look that was perfect for Betty, the only character in this movie that gives this industry any redemption.  For that reason alone, I would have given her the oscar over Josephine Hull.I know that Billy Wilder was one of the people who wrote this script, and if he came up with that line, ""I'm still big, it's the pictures that got small,"" on top of his direction of this movie, he is absolute genius.One of the ten greatest movies ever made."
briancham1994,"Aug 23, 2021",10/10,"Norma Desmond is the epitome of the Hollywood has-been: a narcissistic, privilege, histrionic old woman who is stuck in the past, failing to realise the world has moved on without her. The casting of Gloria Swanson is perfect, both in terms of her insanely flourishing performance and the meta aspect of her career. Her environment reflects her own mental state - unkempt, luxurious and isolated, existing in solitude and maintained only by the most superficial facade of fandom. It is the chance appearance of Joe Gillis that upsets all of this, triggering Norma's need for affection and conflicting with Joe's career desires. This ensnares the characters in a claustrophobic dilemma that grips them until it is resolved through the peak of sheer insanity. This nightmare scenario is fuelled mainly by the expert acting that brings the anguish to life."
Vartiainen,"Jan 14, 2019",6/10,"Probably the director Billy Wilder's most well-known movie. In it a struggling film writer, Joe Gillis (William Holden), happens to meet a former silent film megastar, the dazzling Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She hires him to finish the script she has written, which is supposed to be her great comeback into cinema. But soon Joe finds himself pulled deeper and deeper into her life.I have to admit I have a fondness for movies that are about movies and the business of making them. Hollywood has built quite a legend around itself, a mythos even, and it is admittedly fascinating to watch.This movie is more about actors and acting than it is about movies in general, and it has quite a cynical tone to it. I very much like the fact that they cast an actual star of the silent movie era in Glorian Swanson. Gives the film authenticity. In Swanson you can see echoes of the distant past when movie stars lived like demigods, while the studios built entire sagas around their star power alone. Sure, this star power was carefully built, maintained and patented by the studios themselves. Not that this makes it any less interesting. Quite the opposite.Holden's performance is not bad at all, but it pales in comparison to Swanson's. Holden also talks a lot, providing the film with narration. I think I would have preferred the film without his constant input, but it's hard to say. He does add much needed snark, if nothing else.If we're talking about Billy Wilder movies, I liked both The Apartment and Witness for the Prosecution a lot more, but this one ain't bad either. Recommended."
maddiethatsme,"Feb 20, 2018",10/10,"My favorite film of all time. Everything about this film is amazing in my opinion. It really is almost like a horror film. It shows Hollywoods weaker side and what it does to people like Norma Desmond, they make them stars, and once they get older, they throw them away as if there not needed. But it also takes slaps at writers, studios, film writers, and even directors. Wonderful script, and is masterfully filmed in black in white by Billy Wilder. The acting is absolutely amazing, everyone at their best! William Holden is wonderful in his role. You see all of his emotions very well throughout the film, when he's angry, when he feels sorry for Norma, and the helplessness on his face when he finds out Norma is madly in love with him, and he can't do anything. Max I thought was great too, but his character is quite sad, giving up his whole career of directing to take care of Norma and having to lie to her constantly, telling her she is ""The greatest star of them all"" and its almost like he's making it even worse. Now, Gloria freaking Swanson is just magnificent!!!!!!!!!! Everything, I mean everything about her acting in this film is spot on and incredible. When she loses it finally, it's almost like your losing it too. It's frightening almost. There's so much to discuss, I could go on and no. I can't think of any other film that is as monumental and amazing as this work of art. Gloria Swanson gives the best performence by an actress in movie history! A great classic that everyone needs to see. If you want to work in hollywood, watch this film, you might change your mind."
jordondave-28085,"Nov 1, 2023",7/10,"(1950) Sunset Boulevard
DRAMACo-written and directed by Billy wilder, that has right from the start of this film, the viewer observes a dead body floating in a pool and we are left to ask several questions like how did it get there and who is it and why!! Then comes the narration where it starts to use the ""Rashomon"" formula of point of view and the whole narration is done from one point of view ( and a strange one that is )and by the end, everything comes to make sense. Directed by Billy Wilder whose best known for directing ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Apartment"" with Jack Lemmon. The reason for this rating is because although it's well acted, directed and is self explanatory, the film didn't really offer me what I don't know about the industry that I couldn't find out for myself on my own. As well, that the film industry is definitely not what it's used to be anymore. So even though it kept my eyes peeled in some retrospects it's a little outdated."
jay-22797,"Mar 3, 2025",5/10,"No wonder David Lynch likes it. This movie is actually so scary and dark. They are all greedy for fame, one heading towards madness and the other towards decay, both of which are too lamentable. Moreover, the female lead was a great silent film star back in the day, performing exceptionally well; The filmmakers who appear inside are really directors or something. Hollywood tells its own story, and the feeling of powerlessness in the face of the sun is fading away Seeing it all makes me feel heartbroken... Buster Keaton sat at the bridge table with thick makeup on his face and a clown like sad expression, like a zombie unearthed,"
CarusProductions,"Aug 21, 2011",N/A,"There are many films which have such high praise and rating. All I can find myself doing is wondering- why? 'Sunset Blvd.' is not one of them. In fact, it earns every star on the meter and beyond.The female lead is screen legend Gloria Swanson. She was one of the few who made the transition from silent to sound with success. From working with Rudolph Valentino to classic director Billy Wilder, no one knows the business better than Swanson. It's no wonder why she was perfect for the role. She is chilling, even when she doesn't move a finger. She portrays the typical has-been of Hollywood attempting a comeback, despite not being a has-been herself.""I AM big. It's the pictures that got small.""Many narrators often ruin a film, but the narration by lead actor William Holden meshes perfectly within the storyline. His character is a screenwriter waiting for a big break. An ironic pairing from both ends of showbusiness. Swanson's role wants him to help edit her latest script in order to help her return to the silver screen. She is disturbed, going so far as a suicide attempt to manipulate him to stay with her.Cecil B. DeMille also makes a cameo. For any of you too young or not familiar with classic cinema, he is known for directing eighty films, such as 'The Ten Commandments', 'Samson & Delilah', and did many silent films earlier in his career with Gloria Swanson herself.'Sunset Blvd.' is timeless. Even though years change, showbusiness doesn't."
willrams,"Feb 22, 2003",8/10,"I had seen this back in 1950 only once, and had forgotten how it started but today having seen it on TCM TV, now I know what all the fuss was about.  It was about a silent screen star, Gloria Swanson, who after her career ends obsessively keeps thinking she is always the star; a young reporter lives with her to get her story.  But she kills him in the end in a rage of jealousy.  What aroused my excitement was all the famous oldtimers who appeared as themselves in Gloria Swanson's career were also in this picture, ie. Director Cecil B. DeMille as director; Eric Von Stroheim as her valet (he was a very strong director in her early years),  and many other famous people.  William Holden was nominated for his role as the writer."
johno-21,"May 11, 2006",10/10,"I've seen this many times. From the moment it was made it was destined to be a classic. William Holden plays a B-movie screenwriter struggling in Hollywood and about to get his car repossessed when he pulls into a driveway of an old mansion owned by a silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, who has long faded from the public's and Hollywood's memory and lives as a recluse. Her butler, played by Eric Von Stroheim, is the first of her three husbands and who as former director discovered her. Holden grabs an opportunity to live in the mansion and write a screenplay for the Norma Desmond character's comeback to films. She falls in love with him with designs on him being her fourth husband and things start unraveling. Also in the cast are Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Jack Webb and in wonderfully scripted cameo roles are a cast of stars from the silent movie era, director Cecil B. DeMille, actor-comedian Buster Keaton, actress Ann Q. Nilsson, actress-turned present day gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and actor H.B Warren. Stroheim is also from the silent era as is Swanson herself. She made 58 silent films in just 16 years between 1914 and 1930 and was one of Hollywood's biggest names but only made five films in the 30's and by 1934 with the film Music in the Air at age 37 her career ended. She returned in 1941 to make a comeback film but disappeared again until she got the role in Sunset Boulevard at the age of 53. A role she played so convincingly that it would typecast her as Norma Desmond and she only made one other film before disappearing from the big screen once again. She would show up occasionally on television and made a couple more screen roles late in her life. John Seitz is the film's cinematographer who himself got his start photographing silent films in a long 45 year career where he was never out of work. He had been the cinematographer on such silent film classics as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Arab, and Scarmouche to name a few so he was an ideal choice to photographer this film. His career also would go on to include The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock, Double Indemnity and Sullivan's Travels. Famed writer director Billy Wilder was making a name for himself and had already directed such pictures as The Lost Weekend, A Foreign Affair and Double Indemnity. Wilder wrote the screenplay with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. among it's 11 nominations were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and a heavily nominated cast in Holden for Best Actor, Swanson for Best Actress, Olson for Best Supporting Actress and Von Stroheim for Best Supporting Actor. The Academy Awards for 1950 were All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard with the two films nominated for a total of 25 awards with nine nominations between the two casts alone. Sunset Boulevard also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Score and received an additional three Globe nominations. It's film noir, drama, satire, dark comedy and comes close to a horror story too. If you like any or all of those genre categories you'll like this film. If you have an appreciation for the silent era films as I do you'll like this even more. I give it a 10 out of 10."

jpintar,"Apr 2, 2003",10/10,"This is an outstanding film.  Though it was made in 1950, it is still timely today.  You simply could replace a silent film star with, say, Michael Jackson and you could make this movie today.  Norma Desmond is the ultimate tragic character in movie history.  She is so out of touch with reality that she destroys herself.  William Holden was never better.  I think this is a superior film to All About Eve even though both films haven't aged.  No character in All About Eve, though, is likable so it is difficult to keep with the film.  Sunset Boulevard, though, is full of tragic characters but they are also likable.  That is why it is superior."
guy_anisimov,"Jan 31, 2007",10/10,"the reason i find this picture so interesting is the very delicate issue it talks about.an aging x Hollywood star is having a very hard time dealing with the fact she's getting old and still dreams of her big comeback to pictures even though they have changed from the time she used to act.having a hard time getting old is a very common thing its just that this specific woman develops it to some kind of madness or psychotic sickness that is damaging her life more and more as time goes by.she is basically obsessed with herself which naturally is the reason she gets neglected by everyone and ends up being lonely again and again, this loneliness is eventually what will make her suicidal.the only one who is always there and never leaves her is her servant which is her first husband.my opinion on this is that they got married when she was young and healthy with no sicknesses or self obsessions. this is also the reason he stays with her all along, because he knows how she is when she is OK and he's probably waiting for the day she will return to herself.the film is very exciting and even though you know from the start what is about to happen in the end you cant know exactly how it happens.it makes you feel really good watching a movie that is almost 60 years old for the first time and still being satisfied of it i.i have never seen a story like this in film before and even if i did i don't believe it would have been the same as in sunset blvd.i cant finish without saying something about the ending, it really doesn't get better then this.perhaps one of the best endings i have ever seen on screen."
jfgibson73,"Aug 17, 2021",10/10,"Here is another perfect movie that tells a great story with amazing performances. I can't give it anything but a ten for being the towering classic that it is. However, I will admit that for me, the script has some weak spots, such as any of the banter between Joe and Betty. It's pretty dated. Ditto for all the talk about writing screenplays. But this is still an incredible achievement, especially when you know some of the details behind the making of it. This is a good one to play the commentary to. Very entertaining."
pinkpanther1164,"May 8, 2010",7/10,"Sunset Boulevard from 1950 is a magnificently twisted Film Noir. Norma Desmond was a once extremely famous Hollywood Actress. Everyone knew who she was, loved her films and her mind absolutely adored her. What Norma doesn't realize is that she has been out of the spotlight for a longtime. She has been hiding away in her once gorgeous home, holding on to what she once was. Her house is very reflective of what she herself had become over the years. The house hadn't received much attention and in turn has become dull and un-groomed; Norma Desmond did the same. Joe Gillis is a screenwriter that has also been struggling with his career. He manages to fall in to Norma's world, and in the end shatters it. Joe agrees to help Norma with her comeback film, but in the process realizes that nobody is waiting to see it. Norma's mental state isn't always logical, but her character makes you feel for her. She was once this beautiful actress that was on top of the film world; now she's lucky if she is a distant memory. This is a dark film that shows what fame can do to a person. Norma seems as though she is stuck in the spotlight and doesn't know how to live life otherwise. The script was great, but Gloria Swanson was perfect at pulling everything together."

AAdaSC,"Jun 4, 2024",7/10,"Screenwriter William Holden (Joe) is in financial difficulty when he encounters lonely washed-up actress Gloria Swanson (Norma) living in her mansion with her butler Erich von Stroheim (Max). There is something not quite right with Swanson as she surrounds herself with pictures of herself, watches only her old movies and generally thinks she is wonderful. She demands that Holden write a film for her so that her adoring public will once again get to admire and realize her talent. Well, basically, she is bonkers and Holden gets sucked in and caught up in her madness.Swanson makes this film and she can be very funny. My wife liked her. I felt a bit sorry for Holden's friend Jack Webb (Artie) as a relationship develops between his fiancée Nancy Olson (Betty) and Holden and this didn't endear me to either of these parties. I didn't really relate to Holden's character but the film succeeds because of the strong presence of Swanson. You can probably guess, as I did, the whole von Stroheim thing.If you practice self-delusion for long enough, you will only progress down one particular avenue. It's madness, my friends!"
bob the moo,"Apr 30, 2008",N/A,"Joe Gillis is a writer with a couple of b movies to his name; he is looking for his break in Hollywood while also avoiding the trouble that comes with the lifestyle he is trying to live. Pulling in off the street into the driveway of one of the fancy old houses on Sunset Boulevard, Joe finds himself called into the home of faded film star Norma Desmond. Joe only enters to get help with his car but ends up staying the night in a spare room only to find all his stuff brought inside the next morning. When the benefit of Norma's wealth sinks in, Joe decides to hang around while still pursuing other options. However Norman's constant delusions of her own fame and importance put strain on their strange relationship.I was not sure what to expect from Sunset Blvd because, as much as I would like to pretend that I have a well-rounded cinematic knowledge, I had not only never seen this film but also didn't know what it was about. I had it in my head that it was some sort of film noir and this was only reinforced with the famous opening with our main character floating dead face down in a pool. With this in my head I was a little disappointed where this ""classic film noir"" in my head did not materialise. However while I was watching it waiting for my perceptions to be satisfied, I started to take notice of what the film actually was. To my surprise I found a film that cuttingly destroys the myth of Hollywood fame within a dramatic plot. We have both extremes here: Joe frantically trying to get fame and Norma driven mad by her insulated grip on her delusional sense of fame. The ugly nature of both is exposed and used to good effect in a story that isn't as dramatic or tense as I hoped, but still easily held my attention.Wilder's direction is solid as he throws in constant digs at the façade of the famous lifestyles in the movie industry of the day and even by today's standards it is pretty sharp in its tone. Interesting to wonder how it must have been received within the industry itself back in the day because it is not flattering to say the least. The central relationship is the focal point of the film and Wilder never allows us to see even a hint of reality about it  both are in it for a neediness and longing for something out of reach that can be smelt in the air anytime sufficient quantities of wannabes are gathered together in one place. The cast get this well, although their ability to totally translate it isn't totally successful in my opinion. Holden is perhaps a bit too restrained and I would have liked to see more self-disgust rise uncontrollably to the surface across his performance. That said he does provide a reasonably balanced focus to the film and his performance is solid. Swanson hams it up like an old pro and, although at times I had my doubts, it mostly works really well because she is convincingly deluded and isolated by her wealth and by the inflated idea of who she is based on a perception of herself not shared by anyone. It is an interesting character piece and, from my understanding, very relevant in a business where the next big star is always round the corner with fickle audiences and studios. The only reservation I have is how much her performance towers over the film but this is only a minor problem and it is telling how many lines and scenes I already know second-hand before I even watched it. Von Stroheim is good value in a supporting role, while Olson is also pretty good. Surprising but very relevant to see Keaton, DeMille, Warner and others in cameos as themselves.Overall this was not what I expected but, once I settled into watching it for what it was rather than what I thought it was going to be, I found a surprisingly sharp and fresh film. Wilder directs scenes with style and flair but it is the cutting judgement on fame and the nature of Hollywood that sticks in the memory. It does tend towards the melodramatic and perhaps it is one of those films (like The Player) that will mean the most to those who can relate to the world it is set in, but it is still an engaging and enjoyable film to those of us lucky enough to watch from the outside."
nymovielover1961,"Dec 17, 2008",10/10,"You are all out of your minds if you gave this movie less than an eight. And if you hated Some Like It Hot, I'm convinced that you have no soul. If you hated something as masterful as The Apartment, then you have a hole where your heart should be. If you hate everything Billy Wilder ever did, you have no soul, heart, or brain-- you're just a retarded stick with opposable thumbs. In other words, I hate you if you hate Billy Wilder.Wilder was and always will be one of the greatest writer-directors that Hollywood has ever known. Some of you are forgetting the purpose of film-- to take you away to a world that you didn't know and entertain you. That's what Billy did, only he made it funny, satirical, or both. Sunset Boulevard did get dull at points, but that's life. If you don't want movies to be somewhat real, go delude yourself and watch Teletubbies. Personally, I wish that someone would bring Billy back from the dead to make another movie and make all of the people who probably enjoyed Disaster Movie appreciate his brilliance.So God, please send your son down here so that he can do that Lazarus thing and bring back Billy. We need him down here. With a new generation of Hannah Montana's that will marry Jonas Brother look-a-likes, I need Sunset Boulevard. Because it reminds me that Hollywood isn't perfect. It's real and imperfect just like the rest of life.I Heart Billy Wilder!"
kalbimassey,"Jan 12, 2021",8/10,"Some artists do not enjoy watching themselves in performance. Often seeking seclusion and shying away from the glare of publicity. At the opposite end of the spectrum are the self absorbed, obsessed and enveloped by their own importance.Sunset Blvd.'s Gloria Swanson is one such figure. Twenty years past her sell-by date, but still wallowing in her once glittering career as a silent star. Existing as a recluse, with only servant Erich von Stroheim for company. Driven by the fantasy of a glorious return to the screen.Enter floundering, creatively bankrupt hack, William Holden, who realizes too late that not scrounging, scraping and scrimping the outstanding payment on his car proves to be a costly mistake. A wardrobe full of expensive clothes and a primarily liquid diet of vintage champagne cannot disguise the fact that by parking his ailing automobile in Swanson's garage he has become imprisoned in her bizarre, unreal world.Holden's onerous task of transforming Swanson's muddled, woeful scripts into a marketable finished product for Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount, in order to rekindle the all but forgotten star's career, is nothing short of a' silk purse from a sow's ear' undertaking. Throw in the added ingredient of Swanson's constant meddling and it descends into a challenge as thankless as polishing a cowpat. Meanwhile, Swanson remains blissfully ignorant of the fact that both she and the industry that once embraced her, have both changed beyond recognition.Overlong, overrated and occasionally overbearing Wilder's dark satire nonetheless, presents a unique insider's view of a Hollywood on the brink of the big collapse. Studio-bound and stagy, seven decades on Sunset Bvld. has lost much of the universal potency and paramount importance evident at the time of its release. Notwithstanding, it remains an incisive statement on the mercurial nature of stardom and the potential damage it can wreak upon those who become intoxicated by its allure. Largely determined by the capricious complexion of audience response. One day you're up and the next.....you're doing an Imodium ad!"
wearethefirstandlastnight,"Jul 8, 2021",10/10,"Sunset Boulevard is one of the great film noir classics and a pivotal movie of the era. It is one of the first to show the darkest shadows hovering over Hollywood. Sunset Boulevard unfolds like a kaleidoscope, like petals of a flowers dropping into tears. The center of the plot, the total convergence of fantasy and reality, is realized in a single moment in the third act, at the top of the staircase of Norma Desmond. Can you spot it? Fantastic characterizations and performances. We in the dark are mesmerized by its haunting message."
rprocter28,"Feb 22, 2012",9/10,"Wealthy, silent film superstar ""Norma Desmond""(Swanson), 50, was cast aside by Hollywood when she neared 30. She revels in her superstar status, delusional that it still exists; she's maintained in her mansion and these delusions of returning to public adulation and screen glory by her former film director (& former husband), now her butler-chauffeur (von Stroheim). The path of a broke, struggling B-film screenwriter ""Joe Gillis"" (Holden) enters Norma's territory and he becomes, for a time, her kept man, helping maintain her obsession of recapturing her superstardom. When he attempts to leave, this unhinges Norma more and she kills him. (NOTE: this is NOT a ""spoiler"" since the movie opens with Joe's dead body and his narrative voice-over.)This, one of the greatest of all Billy Wilder great films, was made only 22 years after the advent of ""talkies"" replacing silent films. It was THE first film to take a critical look at how Hollywood operated, especially in treating its former stars--& most especially young women--who were typically cast aside when they they lost their late teens/early twenties aura and glow.Film buffs will love the many inner details of this film: e.g., von Stroheim was actually Swanson's director in making the film which he (as butler) runs for the 2 leads to see. Swanson's imitation of Chaplin's Tramp is precious. With the later ""Singing in the Rain"" and now with ""The Artist,"" this was the first of (IMO) the 3 most significant films dealing with the drastic effects on so many people of the transition from silents to talkies. (Wilder's less than glowing look at then traditional Hollywood has been hailed as a breakthrough and a first, because--before that--Hollywood had to be glorified in films.)My rating: is 10 of 10 bearing in mind film history and 8.5/10 without that mindset; compromised at 9."
giora77,"May 17, 2018",10/10,"What a wonderful and witty script, filled with cynicism and an immaculate set up of two characters-Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond-who are so different that they perfectly drive each other deeper into each other's hubris. The more I learned about the history of that time, and the wise allegory the film makes so ahead of its time, the more I appreciate this cinematic gem.It's hard to know where to begin. The larger than life settings are awesome in the true sense of the word: from the formidable and grotesque mansion (with more trinkets than those owned by the world's best hoarders), to the real film sets in Paramount Studios, and the humdrum writing office turned into a courting stage filled with spark and excitement. The acting is fantastic, and Gloria Swanson seems to have been born for this part-perhaps her creation of Norma was inspired by her own experience, being a silent film star herself.The intelligent plot and character development brings both Desmond and Gillis to self-destruct, and bury each other further in delusions, while staying entirely convincing throughout. The misery of both of them, and their consequent desperation and need for each other, makes the viewer even more engrossed in the picture and the inevitable fate of the two.There are not enough words to describe the magnificence and precociousness of this film-it simply needs to be experienced and taken in. How lucky to have been able to watch it on the big screen! Thank you TCM."
jordyntsmith,"Nov 13, 2023",6/10,"A down in his luck Hollywood writer suddenly finds himself forced into the delusions of a washed up old-time Hollywood actress.The movie isn't bad, but I do t necessarily think it should remain as one of the best films of all time. To be fair, the acting is quite good, and most of the writing is clever. However, I found it a challenging film to take seriously and in which to suspend my disbelief. I understand that it is somewhat based on a set of real situations, but I simply was not taken with it.I think true film buffs would love this movie, if not for the nostalgia. But it won't resonate with most audiences."
dmblanch,"Mar 4, 2004",N/A,"Recently I decided to rent all of the AFI's top 100 movies that I'd never seen. To my surprise, only three were missing.  Birth of a Nation, Some Like it Hot and Sunset Blvd.  Of the three, I found that two were still great and this is one of them. (BoaN was the clunker, in my opinion).  As timely today as it ever was, all of the archetypes presented ring true and could be cut from today's cloth as well as the vintage vicuna of Gigolo Joe's overcoat. The dialogue sparkles, the acting impresses, the direction stands out (some tracking shots are among the best ever committed to celluloid).  Often imitated, never surpassed, it's as good as its hype.  Don't miss."
sansho-4,"Jul 31, 2000",8/10,"I agree with most everything said, and just wanted to add my nomination for the best line in the film.  When Norma Desmond returns to the (Paramount) lot to pitch her old friend Cecil B. DeMille, the spotlight operator trains the spotlight upon her as the curious younger generation gathers around.Norma is eating up the attention, and the viewer may even begin to hope beyond hope that her plan might get off the ground when DeMille--old, weary, and pitying--calls up to the man and says,""Okay, put that spotlight back where it belongs.""And the crowd melts away. To me, it's the most heartbreaking and illusion-shattering moment ever put on film.  Wow."
