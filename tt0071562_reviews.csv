umunir-36959,"Aug 9, 2019",10/10,"One of the all time greats. Or probably the alone greatest thing ever made in the history of cinematography. This movie is both ""prequel"" and ""sequel"" of the first godfather movie. I have never watched anything like this in my entire life. This movie has explained the life of underworld people in a great way. It also shows how vengeance eradicates happiness from your life. People don't even care about their family in greed of power. It's a masterpiece that can never be written off even after centuries. Even if you are not into these kind of movies, I will suggest to watch it for atleast once in your life or you'll be deprived of one of the greatest things to watch that have been ever made."
DanB-4,"May 7, 1999",10/10,"The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (""Keep your friends close ....."", ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies""), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent."
taimur74,"May 9, 2001",10/10,"This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time."
AgustinCesaratti,"Oct 6, 2019",10/10,"To say that this film is a sequel is a sin.
Al Pacino and Robert de Niro win the Oscar for this film, Robert de Niro's performance as Vito Corleone is perfect, every scene in which this one is perfect. Al Pacino as always perfect and unlike the first film, he is much better.PROS:EVERYTHING. The script, the direction, the cast, the performance, everything in this film is perfect and its 3 hours are worth it.CONS:NOTHING. This movie is perfect."
0U,"Feb 23, 2020",10/10,"""The Godfather: Part II"" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 ""The Godfather"" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel."
ballen8,"Feb 1, 2000",10/10,"The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see."
jzappa,"Feb 22, 2009",10/10,"Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, ""You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago."" What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, ""It had nothing to do with business."" The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once."
mentalcritic,"May 8, 2005",9/10,"The Godfather, Part II is one of the most revered sequels of all time, if not the most. While I prefer the original for a few reasons, this sequel is not without more than its fair share of merits. However, it also has one or two flaws that, if I am going to be fair, I have to mention. Since they will take up the least amount of space in my comments, I'll get them out of the way first. The first flaw, in my opinion, is a jumping sense of focus. As the story goes from one part of America to Cuba to Sicily to another part of America, one can get a little giddy with the to and fro. The other problem is that when the screenplay doesn't follow Mario Puzo's original writings, it doesn't quite work. The big conspiracy with a Jewish smuggler and unnamed Italian rivals in the New York or Nevada underworlds doesn't quite seem to gel. Both stories, the historical story of Vito Corleone and the present-day story of Michael's decline, really needed three hours of their own. It is interesting to note that of all the deleted footage that went into the Godfather Legacy miniseries, the majority came from this film.The acting from all concerned is top-notch, especially from Al Pacino, who sells himself beautifully as the dangerous head of a mafia family in spite of needing to be on platforms to appear at the same height as many of his castmates. Robert Duvall gives a workman-like performance, but he has little to do here other than act out the part of the ever-loyal brother. I think the fact that he was almost irrelevant to the storyline here has a lot to do with Duvall's refusal to join the cast of the third film. The real surprise here is John Cazale, who fleshes out Fredo Corleone far beyond anything in either the first film or the novel. It is unsurprising that all of the films Cazale has been in have been nominated for Best Picture. He portrays the rejected brother who just wants what he feels is his fair share with an uncanny grace. But these are just the highlights. The entire cast give top-notch performances, even the extras who appear for less than ten seconds.The best thing about a Godfather film is how it builds a simple story of a family who, whether they wanted it or not, happen to be in the business of organised crime. The bloodshed of this film, much as was the case in the original, is secondary to the simple premise that these are ordinary people in an extraordinary position. Francis Ford Coppola has previously stated that he saw The Godfather as a (relatively) modern King Lear, and that style is kept up in the sequel. Michael is in essence the new King of the realm, but he learns the hard way that the more he tries to tighten his grip upon what is his, or what is loyal to him, the more it slips away. This is the film in which we learn why this is not what Vito Corleone wanted for his youngest son. Sadly, fate has a way of getting in the path of our best intentions, and nowhere is this more evident than in Diane Keaton's dialogue. Some of her speech to Al Pacino really sounds like it was either written at the last moment, or by someone who didn't have a whole lot of experience in writing films.Like the other Godfather films, the most satisfying moments are when the opponents of the Corleone family get their hash settled in a big way. The montage shown in Part II is not as graphic as that of the original, but it brings the whole thing to a satisfying climax. Lee Strasberg's speech to the press after his character being deported from Israel is priceless, as is the manner in which it ends. Unfortunately, the etiquette that dictates I cannot reveal what happens at the end of the film means I cannot tell you anything about the most satisfying death in the film. Being one of the most debated and criticised scenes among Godfather fans, I am fairly certain that anyone with an interest in the film is going to hear about it elsewhere anyway. In spite of the fact that it, and the necessary lead-up, takes up most of the second half of Michael's plot segment, it will leave many a viewer stunned. But that is one of the things that detracts slightly from this cinematic tour de force. With the screen time so sharply divided between two stories, sometimes the linking between plot points seems to fall by the wayside.I gave The Godfather, Part II a nine out of ten. In contrast to the original, I noticed the passage of time on a few occasions in its two hundred minutes. Still, if you're out to see a good drama, and you've already enjoyed the first Godfather, then this is worth a couple of viewings. If every director adaptating the writings of others into a film format took as much care as Francis Ford Coppola had here, then the world would be a better place."

son_of_cheese_messiah,"Jun 12, 2010",5/10,"At the time of its release, many claimed this to be a finer film than the original. However, the passage of time has been less kind to this than that iconic movie.Much of the problem stems from the decision to make this both the sequel and prequel to the first film at the same time. So we have the back story of Vito Corleone and the ongoing adventures of his son Michael inter-cut throughout. This adds to the films inordinate length, which would have been long enough if Michael's story alone was told, but here is stretched to almost 4 hours.Details in both stories fail to convince, the Vito back story most of all. It is scarcely believable that a well meaning outsider could so easily take over the underworld in the manner portrayed. As played by De Niro, he is a Robin Hood 'feared by the bad, loved by the good' but why he is so universally feared not plausible. He could have easily been taken out. The real Vito Corleone would have had to have been much nastier and been prepared to deal with his opponents brutally. His character is whitewashed for Hollywood consumption. And there is some cack handed attempts at humour during, for instance, the slum landlord scene.There is, of course much fine acting from all, especially in Michael's story arc. This differs from Vito's since while Vito's is very simple, Michael's is very very complex. Too complex perhap. Various well known events from the 50s merely are stuck together to form the backdrop. The Mafia involvement with pre-revolutionary Cuba; congressional hearings; plus a few subtle hints at the Kennedy assassination. The narrative is exceptionally loose and meandering. The writing is surprisingly unsubtle, with clinking plot points being underlined again and again.The female characters are under-used but make the most of their meagre parts. Talia Shire's impassioned plea to her brother sticks in the mind, but elsewhere she barely speaks a word. Diane Keen has a better role and sinks her teeth into it with gusto.The film belongs to Al Pacino who dominates this in the way that Hamlet does in Shakespeare's play. Its an accomplished performance as would be expected. There is certainly enough here to make it worth watching, but it could have been much better."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Sep 12, 2004",10/10,"After seeing The Godfather and improving it as one of my favorite films, I wanted to get more into The Godfather so I rented this. Words can't describe how great this sequel was. The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel.10/10"
Dragava,"Jul 18, 2020",9/10,The only negatives produced by this film and its predecessor are that they're nigh-impossible to match in terms of cinematic strength. Perhaps we'll never see pictures like these again. Staggering filmmaking.
Bill-247,"Dec 6, 1998",N/A,"Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, ""The Godfather"".  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb."
alexkolokotronis,"Jun 30, 2008",10/10,"To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one."
nqwpwfq,"Oct 4, 2023",10/10,"Truly a masterpiece!!!Character development is perfected. Francis Ford Copolla takes us on Vito's journey to become ""The Godfather"". From an orphan Sicilian immigrant to a well respected, level headed and powerful figure in his community, Vito's evolution is beautiful.Michael's story goes down a different route... the quiet, respectful boy at the start of the first film is no more.The Godfather Part II shows how different their paths are. One whose family are connected and the other disjointed. This masterpiece gets you pondering about what ifs... can't help but wonder who Michael would have become if he had Vito's guidance for a little bit longer.Timeless film - will never lose its magic. 10/10."
AlsExGal,"Feb 3, 2025",10/10,"The Godfather Part 2 is only a half hour longer than the first Godfather film, yet it feels much longer. The first film is largely linear story telling that focuses on Michael Corleone changing from the college kid returning from war who bluntly says he is not his family into the head of that same crime family. He's even willing to have relatives killed and lie about it to the other relatives.The second part, however, reaches an epic proportion, showing the extent of the mafia. It's also an examination of Michael Corleone--he starts as his father, but becomes worse than he or anyone in his family ever was.Michael Corleone is a man weighed down by the world. He's constantly exhausted. It's like he's haunted by death. NOW contrast that with Vito, his father, who grew to power by helping other people and connecting with the community around him. Vito's story, despite the violence and murder, is much more positive because it shows a man rising to become someone great. Michael, however, becomes a shell of a man. He does all these things ""to protect his family,"" but just drives them all away in the end.I think it's the complexity of the storytelling that really makes Part II outshine the first. They are both masterpieces, but I really feel that Part II is essentially perfect with every frame and every word that's spoken."
awesomesteinberg,"Aug 13, 2014",10/10,"Normally, movie sequels aren't very good. They are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Terminator 2,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" are examples of these.) Prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. So, normally, the 1974 follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" would have a lot to do in order to top the original. But, despite this, ""The Godfather Part II,"" is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (I take back what I said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, I hadn't seen this one yet.)""The Godfather Part II"" is actually two films in one. Expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s Michael Corleone, now as the head of the Corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. The other half follows his father, Vito, in 1920s New York as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to Michael. Both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched.Like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. Al Pacino returns as Michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (I can't say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his I have seen. Sorry, ""Scarface"" fans.) He is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. If you have read my review for ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" you'll remember I named some performances that would be on a list of the Top 10 Best Movie Performances. I have no doubts that Pacino in this film would be right on there.Before watching this, I had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend Marlon Brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by Robert De Niro. (I haven't yet seen ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull."") But after watching it, I feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. He is so good that I can't decide who did a better job, him or Brando. Good thing he wasn't cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldn't have this terrific performance.Although Pacino and De Niro are the highlights in this movie's cast, the others are excellent as well. Robert Duvall as Michael's stepbrother, Tom Hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty/fear of his changing stepbrother. Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, a man who Michael is trying to kill, is excellent. Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. And, of course, there is John Cazale as Michael's brother Fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things don't go according to plan. (I won't go into specifics.)Just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. Doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. It reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. It features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. This installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker.The film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. The score by Nino Rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. The cinematography by Gordon Willis continues to shine. (Even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) The production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope I mentioned previously. The violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. The editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. If I have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as it's longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. But, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven.This film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. I may have been disappointed that the first film only won three Oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second Best Picture, which were all well deserved. (I have no idea how Pacino didn't get Best Actor, but, according to ""Some Like It Hot,"" ""Nobody's perfect."") Clearly topping the original, ""The Godfather Part II"" is the Best Film of All Time, so of course, I have to give it a 10/10 rating."
ChristopheriRuffin,"Jul 20, 2018",10/10,"This movie is one of the Greatest Mafia Movies of all-time in my view! The depiction of a Mafia Family was really the focus of this movie!

The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless."
BA_Harrison,"Mar 7, 2016",6/10,"The Godfather Part II is one of those rare sequels that is regarded by many to be as good as, if not better than, the original. I'm guessing that much of its popularity lies in the fact that it is not just a sequel, following Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he continues to expand his family's 'business', but also a prequel, charting Vito Corleone's life from a child in Sicily at the turn of the 20th century to powerful New York mafia don. Two films for the price of one!Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, only half of this 'double-bill' is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael's continuing underworld activities in the '50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest. That's a disappointing average of 6/10."
Soysoy,"Nov 2, 2006",5/10,"So this is something that ranks as #2 on IMDb... this time I think I have to face the fact that I'm totally disconnected from the vast majority of movie addicts. So take this review with a grain of salt: I'm an outsider, definitely.I kinda liked the first Godfather, while not considering it as great cinema I found it engaging, well put together, with strong moments, all in all a good movie. Not so here. To me this was excruciatingly boring.I actually liked the overture scenes very much. Then we leave Italy for the USA, and after 40 minutes I was still waiting for something to vaguely interest me. These endless contrived stories about the Italian Mafia (mob) have become such a cliché in movies that it's impossible for me to attend all this convoluted, ultra-codified stuff without getting successively amused, then annoyed, then plain bored. So when the cinematic and staging aspects are great, like in SCARFACE or ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, I just take that stuff for what it is, a genre film bound by rules, and enjoy it from the great acting, direction and purely cinematic elements (in De Palma's case -Scarface- the fabulous camera eye, in Leone's case -Once upon a time- the mindblowing psychological staging and the terrific cinematography).Here the staging is mostly sloppy, long parts of the movie feels like it's been produced too fast, with poor cinematography and loose acting, some others are just as good as in the first movie but they're too scarce.Pretty average, exploitative, complacent stuff for me. Sorry, I've seen so many movies that I need much more than that to be impressed. As far as classics goes, I'd rather watch ""12 angry men"" or ""Le Procès"" for the 30rd time than another of these cliché-ridden mob movies."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 24, 2023",10/10,"The Godfather saga continues, telling The story of Vito, his childhood and journey to America, and the story of hia son Michael, who would become a immensely powerful criminal in the 1950's.When someone tells you that sequels are never as good as the originals, give them this name, you can make a very strong case. I'd have to put this on par with the original, quite simply put, it's one of the greatest films ever made.There isn't a single wasted frame, every decadent scene matters, every action has consequences, every twist, every turn, every moment, will have you captivated.The original was a mammoth success, so commercially it was the right thing to do, but at no point does this film feel like a hollow, money making exercise, it merely serves to build on the brilliance of the first, serving as both a prequel and sequel.Director Francis Ford Coppola truly delivers in every single front, the story is magnificent, but the way the two elements are clearly woven together, effortlessly, the viewer never struggles to keep up.The visuals are sensational, it is one of the best looking films ever made, there's a huge cast, with a massive number of extras, cars, fashions and sets look tremendous.De Niro was superb, Al Pacino's performance is arguably one of the greatest of all time, it's easy to see why for many he is one of the best ever.What I wouldn't give for a solid gold telephone.One of the best films ever made, I can only imagine how many great movies were influenced by this masterpiece.10/10."
Quinoa1984,"Feb 21, 2000",10/10,"The Godfather part 2 gets very close to the title for best sequel ever made, but not quite. Even so, I would rank this among the superior films to follow up on another and still be as strong and appealing and dramatically satisfying as the former. The structure of the film is also very important as it jumps back and forth between two stories of Corleone's without any disconnected feelings for the audience. Both could work as perfect single films on their own; together it's like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant. It's spectacular in many ways, masterpiece in fact, and has become as important as the first one (it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms) and the acting all around is well-knit (even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth), the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film, and most of the scene work is fantastic.One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film, as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando. If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him, as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s. Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times (the ""in my home"" bit is priceless). John Cazale, by the way, is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that he'll be remembered for twenty years down the line (the other being Dog Day Afternoon). In short, it's just a very well done picture."
jolivarez-37256,"Nov 10, 2022",10/10,"I have kind of waffled between aliens and this movie but this one gets the crown.Those the only two movies I can think of where the second movie can give the first movie a run for its money and quite possibly surpass it.What can I say?

List is endless.I can come up with a negative thing to say about almost every movie but for the two godfathers into aliens, I come up short. Masterpieces. All of them.On a sidenote, I just researched why Robert Duvall is not in the third one and they said he wanted too much money. I kind of lost respect."
Essential-Films,"Feb 22, 2004",N/A,"Sequels rarely rise to the level of the original, and almost never surpass them. This phrase has been used so often in reference to ""The Godfather: Part II""  the exception that makes the rule. What is even more laudable is the fact that the original is generally considered as a landmark in the history of film.This is one film that proves cinema to be a form of art, and not merely one of entertainment. A skilful direction from Francis Ford Coppola, outstanding performances from the likes of Pacino, De Niro, Gazzo, Strasberg, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton, Shire, memorable cinematography from Willis, a soundtrack by Rota, Coppola and Curet Alonso, and an ingenious script by Coppola and Puzo (partly adapted from his novel), make ""The Godfather: Part II"" stand out as a story of courage, love, treachery, and devotion, crafted in the life of the Corleone saga.The plot follows the consolidation of power of Michael Corleone, and his desire to gain the legality of his business, and the consolidation of power of a young Vito Corleone, and his desire to build a better life for his family. The old story of the father handing his wealth to his sons, gains a new twist by allowing a positive outcome to the original story. The wealth remains in the family, but there are losses to be incurred. An ontological thesis of Pareto optimality into the organisation of social structures is subtly brought into the view, without harming the general development of the story.""The Godfather: Part II"" remains also as a text book for any actor. Al Pacino shows that temperance can be dramatic, making us empathise with his character even when made to realise the most brutal of actions.  Robert De Niro is purely outstanding, in one of the best supporting performances the screen has witnessed. His charm, charisma, and vocal skills, help him achieve a complete transition to Puzo's Vito Corleone. The viewer is unarmed in the choice given between murder and love, between life and necessity. Talia Shire stands out as the lost woman in a world dominated by men.Even if ""The Godfather"" is the point of reference when it comes to great cinema, ""The Godfather: Part II"" remains a powerful example which proves that there is always more to say in a story, and the additions can be more than surprising."
sme_no_densetsu,"Oct 6, 2010",7/10,"""The Godfather: Part II"" hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best American films of all time.The story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. Michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. However, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. There is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of Vito Corleone and his introduction to mob life.The film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. Unlike the first film, though, I couldn't really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. I didn't find the Vito storyline particularly compelling and the Michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. These stories were meant to be compared but I don't feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. Nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though it's nowhere near as consistent as the first film.Most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. Returnees Al Pacino & Talia Shire each landed Oscar nominations and so did newcomers Michael V. Gazzo & Lee Strasberg. However, the only actor to take home an Oscar statuette was Robert De Niro for his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone. Personally, I think that Pacino gave the best performance of the film.Francis Ford Coppola won an Oscar for his direction but I feel that the first film was a better effort. From a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the Nino Rota score was justly rewarded with an Oscar.Ultimately, I don't feel that ""The Godfather: Part II"" lives up to its pedigree. I've watched it a few times, so I'd say that I've given it a fair shake. That being said, I realize that I'm in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. As far as I'm concerned, ""Chinatown"" deserves the Best Picture Oscar that went to this film."
brasileiro_revoltado,"Nov 11, 2025",5/10,"I'll be short.1. In the first Godfather, the mystery behind each killing or decision added intrigue-you didn't always know the ""why,"" but its plot felt logical and tightly knit. Part II's plot is confusing and far less enjoyable- it pushes ambiguity too far. Key events like murders or betrayals, are interrupted by long detours into business, politics, and flashbacks. Combined with the dual timelines and unsatisfying, half-explained closures. It's confusing and enjoyment drops sharply compared to Part I2. The film's pace is a huge slog. Coppola's deliberate slowdown, intended to be contemplative, just comes across as boring. It adds what feels like an hour of useless runtime, padded with long, drawn-out scenes where actors just sit and smokeDefinitely overrated."
richarevans1,"Aug 12, 2003",10/10,"Often seen as possibly a greater film than even ""The Godfather"" this film is truly remarkable. Part of the film is a pre-quel, with Robert De Nero playing a young Marlon Brando (is that a dream casting or not?) partly it's the story of Michael Corleone as he grows into the role of Godfather. Again brilliantly filmed, great acting, a great story of love revenge etc. but in some ways it's harder to sympathise with Michael as he slips further into a hell of revenge and murder. Like watching a car-crash."

BrandtSponseller,"May 10, 2005",9/10,"Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) ""in the role"" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the ""inside"" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended ""flashback"" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call ""J.K. Rowling Syndrome"". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see."
murtaza_mma,"May 17, 2009",10/10,"The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito's death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
peeedeee-94281,"Nov 20, 2019",7/10,"I commend Coppola for taking on Pt 2 and filling in a bit of Viteo Corleone's history, and continuing Michael's saga, with parallels between the two.
It was a good sequel, but I didn't find it as engaging as the first one, which I've seen countless number of times. I just watched Pt 2 recently after not having seen it for a number of years.
I'm not sure why it doesn't have the same feeling as the first. I think the lack of direction (i.e. a clear plot line) didn't help. There was an attempt on Michael's life, and there was talk here and there of doing some extra business, but a lot of it just seemed vague. Much of the movie was spent on the strained relationship between Michael and his family.
Another missed opportunity was explaining Don Vito Corleone's rise to power. You see him assassinate the neighbourhood Don at one point, but then we fast forward years later when he's grown a mustache and is doing favors for people, and vice versa. But we don't get any information on whether he's affiliated with the crime boss that was the boss of the guy he killed, or if he had formed a completely different family. I guess that would have been a 4.5hr movie.
Overall, a good, but not great sequel. Not as quotable either, like the first movie. Did it deserve the Best Oscar Nom and Win. I guess so. There were a lot of great movies that year. But I think the juggernaut of the Godfather saga was too much to pass up giving it the win."

mk-2222,"Apr 25, 2009",10/10,"Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewer's consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michael's character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.I haven't even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I don't have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesn't really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so don't worry if you don't get it - you don't have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing."

And, since there are over 500 reviews for it on the site, I can't think of why I am even bothering to review it. After all, what's one more review that sings its praises?! The acting, writing, direction and entire production is perfect. What more can you say? If you do see the film (and you MUST), try to watch the version that combines the first two films into one--and adds additional story to make it one huge and perfect epic.

DPS03,"Feb 16, 2022",10/10,"For some reason I liked this part better than the first. The showcasing of Vito Corleone's past portrayed by Rober De Niro was something I never knew I needed to see until I saw it. This is where we see Micheal Corleone really transfer into Don Coreloene, and seeing how he did it more chaotically than his father was chilling. The struggle of him being the Don his father was perfectly portrayed by Al Pacino and he should have won that oscar. It is so obvious that the plot is well thought out because everything connects so well and watching this part connects all the dots. The ending scenes of the Godfather trilogy always make my jaw drop and this was no exception. I loved the ending, it just made me even more curious about what would happen next.

It's absolutely incredible.Once again masterfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it lives up to both its reputation and its predecessor.  One of the best parts of this movie is how you see two people changing in parallel:Michael Corleone (Pacino) who becomes a criminal after having sworn to his wife that the family would be legitimate.His father Vito (De Niro in his Oscar- winning supporting actor performance) who goes from good to evil.The movie follows the steps of its predecessor with many classic scenes (the ending especially).  Pacino, De Niro, Starsberg, Duvall, Keaton, and Shire give tremendous performances.  See it."
TheLittleSongbird,"Nov 24, 2010",10/10,"I do have to agree that calling Godfather Part II a sequel is rather insulting. It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Leofwine_draca,"Apr 7, 2014",8/10,"A lot of people seem to consider THE GODFATHER PART II to be the best film ever made, a film that's even better than it's already excellent predecessor. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, I think the original has the edge.The reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. Here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the Corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how Vito Corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as.While I love Robert De Niro and I enjoyed the flashback scenes, I felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so. Therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. It's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. So it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first."
long-ford,"Feb 27, 2009",N/A,"Part II in 'The Godfather' saga carries on in much the same vein though Marlon Brando is sorely missed. The plot has Al Pacino exerting complete dominance as mafia boss in the fifties. The film also depicts young Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) early years. This segment is slightly nostalgic but superbly acted by De Niro who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As a result of the film moving both backwards and forwards in time, it feels more convoluted than the first part. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton both impress. The shocking climax (MINOR SPOILERS) mirrors the ending of the first film. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10"
Steffi_P,"Jul 31, 2010",7/10,"In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.Being a drama, The Godfather Part II's biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brando's middle-aged Don in The Godfather. It's still only a small demonstration of De Niro's talents however.Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roth's wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as she's not a character we need to remember, he doesn't allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. It's intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying ""They're carving up Cuba – geddit?"" But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And what's more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather – the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end – all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel."
krumski,"Feb 5, 2000",4/10,"As a huge fan of the original Godfather, I have never understood all the hoopla about this film. A great continuation of the story? The only sequel to be better than the original? No way, on both counts - not by a long shot.First of all, The Godfather is a movie that truly needs no sequel. When that door closes on Kay at the end, that's it - an entire cycle has played out: power has been passed on, the new guard has superseded the old, evil has corrupted goodness and the sins of the father have come back to feast upon the sons. It is a perfect story, complete in itself and suggestive of all that is to come. Anything you could add would only be elaboration, nothing genuinely new.  As such, there's nothing - not one single thing - which happens in The Godfather Part II that is not either already implied in the first movie or at least could be predicted by knowing the first movie. Therefore, the story just doesn't feel fresh; it feels more like a ""standard"" sequel - that is, one done just for the money, to capitalize on the series while it was hot. (The true greatest sequel of all time, of course, is The Empire Strikes Back - superceding the original in so many ways and on so many levels it's unbelievable.)Now, I'll concede there's an awful lot of artistry on display in this movie - the acting is all great, the cinematography and production design, etc. It certainly doesn't have the *look* of a quickie re-hash. And you can tell that considerable time and effort has gone into the story and in the structuring of the movie. Which makes its failure all the more troubling to watch. First of all, the cross-cutting between the two time periods (Vito Corleone in the early part of the century and Michael in the late '50s) just DOES NOT WORK.  I'll challenge anybody on this point; if you think it's a good idea, you're just WRONG! I can half see what Coppola had in mind here, but it's just annoying. First off, the two sequences are not equally weighted - we see far more of the ""modern day"" Michael segment - and so the Vito scenes come to feel more like an intrusion, a break up of the momentum of the real movie, rather than as a legitimate sequence in its own right. And frankly, it's not a legitimate sequence anyway - it's far too bathed in quaintness and romanticism, it never truly takes Vito to task for the life he has chosen; in fact, it doesn't even give us a good sense of why he has chosen that life. Except for the brief murder scenes, it mostly portrays Vito as a hero - a Robin Hood of the people - and does not give a clear picture of the ruthlessness and cold-bloodedness he would have needed to build up his empire. (For a good portrait of this side of the young Vito, read the chapter in the original Godfather book by Mario Puzo which focuses upon his rise to power. Compare this sequence to the movie's in order to see just how much Coppola has omitted and how much he has romanticized what he's kept.)Coppola wants to save all his rage and condemnation for Michael, you see - almost as if the Corleone crime family was kind of a Mom and Pop store started by the old man in the good old days, and was great and wonderful until the young whippersnapper came in with all of his newfangled ways and started screwing everything up. If Michael's soul is shown as corroded by the end of the movie, why is Vito not assessed in the same harsh way? After all, if not for him, his son would never have been put in this position in the first place. Curiously, Michael's attempts to ""go legitimate"" are portrayed as the real horror here, which is certainly an interesting idea, but I think this is a theme much better developed in The Godfather Part III, where the agent of legitimacy becomes the Church (the Vatican), making for a much richer and headier mix. Here, Michael's mainly trying to buy into resorts and casinos in Cuba. How interesting is that?Finally, this picture moves sooooo slowly and takes so much time to tell its story (er, stories) that it becomes sleep-inducing. Not enough of import happens here for the story to take as long as it does. In short, The Godfather Part II is a film with an inflated sense of its own importance; the wonder is that it has suckered so many millions of people into buying into it. The Godfather is a movie which truly needs no sequel, but if you feel compelled to see one, rent Part III and skip over this tired and pretentious mess."
alijafri-04199,"Jan 8, 2020",10/10,"I'm NOT an Al Pacino fan but this movie has the best performance of Al. I think no one in the history of world cinema has played a character better than Al Pacino in Godfather 2. He deserved an Oscar.
Godfather 2 is better than the first part. It is a great sequel, it expands the themes and the world of the first part. Robert De Niro is stunning as usual. Missed Marlon Brando. Best part of this movie is it shows the rise of Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone contrasting their times and personalities.
You need to watch Godfather 2"
edmunddavies21,"Sep 18, 2005",10/10,"The Godfather part II is a fantastic sequel and a great follow up to the original. Most sequels are not as good as the original, some are plain rubbish. But The Godfather part II is rare because it is just as good as the original (some reviewers say it is better than the first but i don't think so). The performances are brilliant just like in the first. Robert de Niro plays a young Vito Corleone. showing the young life of Vito in the 1920's While Michael tries to extend the family business in the 1950's.

chiragrathod09,"Jul 16, 2024",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather Part II"" stands as a remarkable sequel that not only lives up to the legacy of its predecessor but expands on its themes, crafting a narrative that delves deeper into the complexities of power, family, and identity. Released in 1974, this film seamlessly intertwines two stories-one following Michael Corleone's continued rise to power, and the other tracing the roots of his family through the eyes of a young Vito Corleone.At the heart of ""The Godfather Part II"" is a profound exploration of duality. The film contrasts Michael's ambitious, often ruthless pursuit of control over the Corleone family business with Vito's humble beginnings in Italy and his gradual ascent in America. This parallel storytelling enriches the emotional landscape, allowing viewers to witness the transformation of both characters in juxtaposed timelines.Al Pacino delivers a powerful performance as Michael, showcasing the character's moral descent as he becomes increasingly isolated in his quest for power. His portrayal embodies the internal struggles of a man torn between familial loyalty and the corrupting influence of his choices. Robert De Niro shines as the young Vito Corleone, capturing the essence of a man who transforms from a struggling immigrant to a cunning mafia leader. De Niro's nuanced performance breathes life into Vito, providing insight into the fundamental qualities that define the Corleone legacy.Visually, the film is stunning, with Gordon Willis's cinematography enhancing the narrative's emotional weight. The rich, atmospheric visuals, combined with Nino Rota's haunting score, create an unforgettable cinematic experience. The production design is meticulously crafted, immersing viewers in both early 20th-century Italy and post-war America.""The Godfather Part II"" is a masterclass in storytelling, balancing intricate plotlines with deep character development. It raises questions about legacy, loyalty, and the consequences of ambition, leaving a lasting impact on its audience. This sequel is not just a continuation of the Corleone saga; it is a profound exploration of what it means to be a leader and the sacrifices that come with power. As one of the few sequels to achieve critical acclaim on par with its original, ""The Godfather Part II"" remains a landmark in cinema, solidifying its place as an essential film in the history of storytelling."
YellowManReanimated,"Aug 17, 2021",10/10,"How do you follow up a film as accomplished as The Godfather? How can you progress a narrative which already seems so complete? Well, the answer, it turned out, was to tell a story which presented both a new beginning and a new ending to The Godfather story by drawing on the events of the first film whilst combining and connecting the events of the second in subtle, poetic ways. The story of the first film was about the passing of the torch, the second juxtaposes the lives of the torch passer and torch receiver as it focuses on both the young Vito Corleone: an immigrant forced into exile who, in order to survive and live a life of dignity, takes the pragmatic and courageous decision to turn to organised crime, and his son, Michael Corleone, a man who, tiring of his and his family's precarious life in New York, has decided to reinvent the rules of mob warfare. Via rivers of blood and ruthless violence he has carved out a new path in a new part of America: a place where the traditions and customs of Little Italy have been left behind forever: a place where he now finds himself a stranger, exiled from the Old World, grimly tolerated by the New. We see Vito's rise as a product of his connection to his Sicilian roots, we see MIchael's fall as a result of his inability to meaningfully exist in either new or old America. He is neither Sicilian nor American, he is something in-between, an outsider, an exception, a lone-wolf who has been charged with leading the pack. His determination, calcuation and intelligence sees that he survives, but his growing sense of dislocation leads to the antipathy and bitterness which means that each step along his path there is less to be gained by his survival. Live, he might, but he shall never prosper.The film succeeds so well because, once again, it is a brilliant character study of both Don Vito and Don Michael, played superlatively by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, which this time dresses itself in the garb of a morality tale. On a superficial level, Vito's rise is represented as heroic and wholesome, while Michael's schemes seem bitter and destructive. If Vito is the hero and Michael is the villain, Michael must have lost his way somewhere. Yes, but it's deeper than that. Michael is necessary to his father's legacy. Had Michael not taken action, his father and his family would have been destroyed many years ago. The true consequences of Don Vito's life do not fall on his own head, he retired and then died before that could happen; it was Michael who had to pay his father's true debts, his father's life and everything his father had built becomes his responsibility once he becomes the agent of its continuation. This isn't cinema's greatest tragedy simply because of Michael's nature but because of the nature of the wider story in which Michael finds himself a key and essentially always reluctant player. Both Vito and Michael do the same thing, they both do what they perceive to be their duty: Vito does his duty and spends his life surrounded by his family before dying as a figure of reverance. Michael does his duty and his reward is isolation and suffering. A family is gained only to be lost, it's the son who must bear witness and continue to realise the sins of the father."
youcef-belkhir,"Jan 3, 2015",10/10,"I love this movie for of the very interesting scenario. I also consider the actors playing, certainly amongst the best of their generation. Decors, costumes are also part of the reason I love it.The fact it is about European immigrants in the US, makes it also better for European to watch, without it being one 100% US culture movie. Also some points are true story, that makes it quite remarkable.Overall, I can say that this movie is truly violent, but not as per 2015 understanding. The violence can come in many ways. However, and despite this aspect, this is quite one remarkable movie which deserves to stay up and high in the IMDb ratings.The second part is maybe the best, but is actually really close from the first episode, which in my eyes is actually on the same level."
JimBallard,"Jan 16, 2015",10/10,"It's hard to give an objective review when you are dealing with favourite movies. Having just watched this for the first time in years I was delighted to see it was as magnificent as I remembered it. Francis Ford Coppola would have been sensible to be wary of doing a sequel when he'd just made a film as acclaimed as The Godfather. How do you follow that? Amazingly he managed to broaden the themes of the original, producing a study of power and corruption that may be unequalled in Hollywood history. And whereas some critics found the first film questionable in its moral compass (is Michael supposed to be a hero?) the sequel leaves us in no doubt that he has passed on into something else and as his wife Kay shrewdly notices, there is no coming back. Judge the film on its own merits and ignore the continuation of the saga in Part III. This is the final Michael as we should always remember him.The scope of Part II is extraordinary (as if the first film wasn't bold enough!) with the story of father Vito in 1920s New York cross- cut with son Michael's rivalry with ageing mobster Hymen Roth, a respected, though never trusted, business partner of his father. These later sequences may not make sense on first viewing but there are some remarkable set pieces from revolutionary Cuba to a Senate committee in Washington. This is a no holds barred portrait of American society corrupt and hypocritical from top to bottom. How often has Hollywood been so daringThe film invites a contrast between father and son, with young family man Vito embracing criminality out of necessity and using his status to become a 'Godfather' in the Italian American community. Meanwhile in his middle age Michael has become a Don hooked on vengeance with all business now personal. The inevitable conclusion of which is a violent crescendo with him not just wiping out his enemies (again) but committing the far worse sin of betraying his own family.Few films can have gathered such a fine cast. Al Pacino's Michael is the symbol of idealism turned sour in extremis. More than anything this is what elevates The Godfather over so many other gangster films. He's not just some Goodfella or ordinary guy, he once aspired to be a great man but somewhere something went wrong. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is the great constant across the two films, always at the side, never changing, but in his reaction to the transformation of Michael we get confirmation of his moral decline. Diane Keaton as Kay has a meatier role this time and as the voice of 'respectable' America shows the futility of Michael's actions. If he can't keep his family together, what's it all for? John Cazale's Fredo is a tragedy of his own. Secretly resentful of his younger brother, their mutual betrayal becomes one of the emotional cores of the saga. Replacing the character of Clemenza proved relatively easy as even if the story loses something, Michael V. Gazzo was memorable whilst the legendary Lee Strasborg is a suitably cast as rival/partner and pretend Uncle to Michael Hymen Roth, delivering one of the movies' great speeches.So often artists seem burdened by great achievements, but not here. One can only assume that the young Coppola was so exulted by the critical and commercial phenomenon of The Godfather, he felt capable of anything and judging by this, he near enough was. One only wonders why he's largely struggled to reach similar heights ever since."
mdinaz-61541,"Jul 30, 2025",5/10,"One thing that is epidemic at this website is groupthink. Someone somewhere decided this movie was a classic and dang it, you will decide that too, or else suffer multitudes of thumb-down ratings. The quantity of 9 and 10 lemming ratings illustrates the groupthink, with each reviewer commenting on the same aspects from the same reviewer's script while completely ignoring or totally oblivious to the massive flaws.This movie is way too long at nearly four hours, with meaningless scenes that could have been easily left on the cutting room floor without impacting the story one bit. Incidents happen with no explanation and no lasting emotion on the viewer. The characters are mannequins, being placed from one scene to another, collecting a check, and moving on. There are three mandatory elements that make an excellent film - a compelling story, characters you care about with proper character development, and good acting along with good cinematography. This movie is hit and miss on all three.There are some compelling story arcs here that could have made excellent movies all on their own. I was fascinated with the Havana, Cuba story arc, where the mob had made investments in Havana that you would see later on in Las Vegas, with the background of a dictatorial regime and an impending communist revolution. That alone would make an excellent movie. While the film does spend some time here, it misses a huge opportunity when the story just leaves it behind without another thought, like a vacation you took a decade ago but vaguely remember.The continual ""flashbacks"" (they're not really flashbacks, but long story arcs) to the early Vito years, could also make an interesting film on its own. The film does a terrible job exploring it, as Vito suddenly becomes the don of the city but we have no idea how this occurs - okay, he whacks the big guy, but there is no retribution, no infighting with gangs, no establishing his character - nothing. Nobody knows he whacked the big guy, but somehow he reaps all the benefits of it and suddenly Vito is the big guy, ostensibly with a big crew to uphold his reign but we never see it. Terrible writing.Michael's travails with his wife and progeny would make an interesting film. But they yell and fight and express resentment with no emotion, and the viewer couldn't care less what happens to them. They might as well as be your local neighbors you've called the cops on just so they'll shut up.Many of the other characters have great story arcs but so little emotional focus is put on them that it's hard to care what happens to them, which is the greatest sin a film maker can commit. Considering the outstanding characters Coppola made just a few years later in ""Apocalypse Now"", it's hard to believe it's the same director.Mob films like ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"" did a far better job in story line, character development, and action. You feel the characters - love them or hate them - but the viewer gets sucked into the drama and feels the rage or disappointment or betrayal the characters feel. In ""Godfather 2"", the only thing I felt was my bladder and gratitude that it was finally over."
jacobmeyerjkm,"Feb 10, 2020",10/10,"Now this film is in now way more iconic are crucial to the film world than the first one, but it doesn't need to be. It has yet another gripping and compelling crime narrative. I loved the sets a lot better in this, which is natural seeing as they had a bigger budget. I loved the Robert De Niro storyline and was not expecting it going into this movie, so it was a pleasant surprise. This has perhaps my favorite ending to a film ever, and many end scenes that can compete but it's hard to get better than this one."
RiffRaffMcKinley,"Jan 20, 2008",10/10,"At 200 minutes, the second installment in the timeless ""Godfather"" saga is the longest. And it just isn't quite as good as the delectable original. That being said, it definitely ranks right up there. With a broader, more epic storyline showing the parallels between father Vito (Robert De Niro in his best performance yet) and son Michael (the always, in these films, spot-on Al Pacino), GP2 fascinates audiences with its ingeniously undetectable staging and darker story (Kiss of Death and all).It looks and feels only slightly different from the original, but the difference is good. This is not an attempt to capitalize on its predecessor. Nor is it an effort to repeat that classic. It is simply an expansion of the saga, another bookmark in the great tome of American cinema. And nothing any nay-sayer can... well, say, can change that."

All performances are excellent and there isn't any problem switching back and forth between the early 1900's and the mid 1900's.  It flowed so well. I can't argue with the top 3 rating given by IMDb users."
educallejero,"Aug 4, 2020",10/10,"After the first hour (or so) the movie improves into the elite level of the original, only with a more complex story, full of twists and turns and complications, filled with as intense and gripping moments, and full of Pacino and De Niro's impossibly great acting.But the first hour is a bit boring setting the table for what was about to happen, and with some really long sequences here and there after that, the more than three hours are a bit much. The ending is superb."
Michael_Elliott,"May 3, 2012",N/A,"The Godfather Part II (1974)**** (out of 4)Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece shows the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) who tries to rise in power and seek revenge after his parents are murdered. In the current times, Michael (Al Pacino) survives an assassination attempt and goes to find out who was behind it as well as destroy anyone who might be trying to do the family any harm. There's always going to be a debate on whether this film or the first is the best but for my money I have to hand it to this sequel. While both movies are great, I think this one works so well for numerous reasons but the biggest being that not only is a great sequel by continuing the events of the first film but it's also a great prequel by showing the life of Vito.I've always had a few minor problems with the original movie but I think it would be fair to say that this one here is flawless in every way. Coppola does such a masterful job at making sure everything was on par with the original but you can tell he knew people were going to be questioning him attempting to do a sequel so he wanted to make sure that he delivered even more. As with the first film, this one here has that very slow pace that wouldn't be allowed in any movie today but thankfully the 70s were a much different time. Coppola perfectly uses this slower pacing to really get inside the heads of these people and he really delivers so much character development that you're amazed that so much is able to be done in its epic 200-minute running time. Even more amazing is how quickly the film flies by, which is saying a lot of consider the length and pace.Of course, no one could ever say a negative thing about the performances and they're all masterful. I had really forgotten how wonderful Pacino was here but he's so chilling, cold and deadly quiet that you really do begin to fear him. I'm certainly not going to spoil anything but if you've seen the movie then you know what happens at the end and how Pacino plays this was just a masterful touch. DeNiro, picking up his first Oscar, does a wonderful job too. Doing the Italian language and mastering is obviously impressive but so are the small touches that he brings that connects the character to the later one played by Marlon Brando in the previous film. John Cazale is often overlooked but he has some terrific moments here as does Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and especially Diane Keaton.THE GODFATHER PART II contains all the greatness of the first film and it's a real miracle that Coppola was able to match it and deliver even more. The film works on so many levels but being able to pretty much see two movies rolled into one is something of a lost art. Even rarer is how perfectly both parts are as the drama, tension, violence and pain are all on full display and there's no question that this film deserves its reputation as one of the greatest ever made."
eldreddsouza,"Jun 9, 2021",7/10,"While I absolutely love the Godfather Part 1, I'll have to admit I was a tad disappoinnted by this sequel. Not that I thought it was bad, but it just didn't live up to the hype of being a better sequel or one of the greatest sequels ever. I really don't think so, but then that's because I absolutely loved the performance of Marlon Brando and that's something I loved that film for. I also liked Al Pacino in the first movie, but here with him being fully in control I didn't quite like him. His acting is good, like the way he acts with his eyes and being a man of few words and all, but I still prefer Brando as a lead and want him to carry the film.The cinematography is excellent and by 70's standards it's just incredible and I can see why it must have been loved so much and as a sequel especially. As far as the story goes, this one was nothing groundbreaking or jaw dropping. It was highly predictable, annoying and boring at times.The best part for me were the flashback scenes of Robert De Niro, where he played the young Vito Corleone. The to and fro between the current times and the flashbacks were a tad annoying but I did enjoy the parts with De Niro in them. I usually don't mind long films. I love the Godfather 1972 immensely, but I'll have to admit I found this quite long and tedious to finish and felt a few scenes could have been cut short and it could have been made even better.Overall it's still a pretty solid movie, but you may feel it has not aged too well and is kinda overrated. So going with 7/10 for this one."
calspers,"Sep 4, 2019",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather: Part II"" (1974) is the second installment in the Godfather Saga, masterfully executed as a sequel.In my view, it is the greatest sequel to have ever been conceived. How much pressure Coppola must have felt when embarking on this after the huge success and instant classic that ""The Godfather"" (1972) had become. In spite, he must have kept calm in perfecting the work of Part II.The film centres partly on Michael's descent into the downward spiral of the crime world, as well as the history of his late father, Vito Andolini, beautifully portrayed in the original by the screen legend above them all, Marlon Brando.In part II, Vito's life is presented from when he was a young boy in Sicily, and how the tragic events of his childhood shapes him as a person. We also follow him as a growing adult, portrayed by Robert De Niro, who gives a stunning performance, for which he deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actor. In this period piece part of the film, we see some intriguing character development which contributes to sophisticated storytelling, while simultaneously paying homage to Part I.The character studies of Part II really is what drives the saga's perfection further. Along with a budget twice as large as in Part I, this highly ambitious effort was possible for Coppola to execute to perfection with beautiful shifting set designs and huge staging of the milieus. Naturally, it draws on the same perfect storytelling, direction, cinematography, score and all else that Part I is revered for. But it adds further, with even more intrigue and suspense than what we where exposed to in Part I.A perfect film, and a deeply convincing character study of a man, who has it all but love, and who falls apart from his desires to power and money. Almost on par with Part I, and although some even think this surpasses its perfection, the original remains my favourite film."

Less morally suspect than the 1st Godfather due Michael's fate this is Coppola at his best as director. It is simply remarkable that such an experimental story structure was allowed for a sequel to a blockbuster. No studio today would allow such a thing to occur.I don't have much that can be added to the consensus but this is a mighty fine film."
bkoganbing,"Mar 17, 2008",10/10,"Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather: Part II. Many would argue it surpasses the original. With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, I'd hate to argue the difference.In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. I'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. He's going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keaton's character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. She's a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. He's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredo's big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.Fredo's got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out. He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.If the first Godfather film doesn't do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense."

It's another magnificently filmed effort, wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once you've put it in your tape or DVD player.What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks. Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan. He was shown in a flashback scene near the end, and that was it.One thing was just as good if not better than the first film, and that was the cinematography. The browns, blacks, greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes. I especially love the Italian houses and scenery. Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling.The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.There are some excellent supporting performances in this film, too. I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg."
bob the moo,"Apr 13, 2004",N/A,"Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power."
cdimidenko,"Feb 3, 2022",7/10,"I personally feel like the first Godfather movie is better, probably because it has Vito Corleone (this movie was not the same without him). While Godfather Part II really shows Michael's stress with carrying his father's syndicate and dealing with the problems in his family, I just feel like it was too slow. Yes, it took its time but there also wasn't much that happened. I didn't have a reason to care for what happened to the characters, everyone except Michael and Tom. I did love seeing Tom stay loyal to Mike and Michael use his wisdom and critical thinking to make good choices and see who betrayed him, but what did it do for him in the long run? Is he just going to keep killing everyone close to him because this business means so much to him? I wanted to love this movie more... Maybe it's because I was extremely tired and had to force myself to sit through it that I didn't notice what made it good, but it's really nothing special to me."
darshanr23,"Oct 17, 2025",4/10,"I loved Part 1 and enjoyed it. Part 2 was recently released in 4K back in theatres and I went in expecting a lot. It turned out there is absolutely nothing in the whole movie except Michael being paranoid and making himself irredeemable. It is kind of all dialogue and no action. It is too much talking for my liking. I have watched slower movies in my life, but this is next level. It tests patience and frankly, I am not sure how it won Best Picture at the Academy. It's an alright movie not a classic or anything."
aml60,"Sep 15, 2005",10/10,"The Godfather Part II, is just as good as the first film. Al Pacino was absolutely awesome in this film. His performance in this film is one of my personal favorites, and probably one of his best performances of all time. This film was so good because it continues the story of Don Michael Corleone's rise to the top, and then slowly to the bottom at the end. Plus another cool thing about the movie, is that it has several flash backs on the life of younge Vito Corleone, played by Robert DeNiro (who also gave a great performance). Again the directing, and story telling, and the acting were great in this movie. It is truly the greatest sequel of all time."
estebangonzalez10,"Sep 22, 2010",10/10,"¨Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.¨ Coppola's (or should I say Puzo's) The Godfather Part II is considered by many as the best sequel of all time, and some even consider it to be better than the original. In my opinion it is not as good as the first part, but there is no denying this is a great film nonetheless. Coppola did a great job with the direction once again, and has created a timeless film that movie fans go back to time after time. There are several things he did well with this film. First of all he took a completely different approach towards romanticizing the Corleone's. In the first film we were attracted to Vito for his strong family beliefs and loyalty to his friends, in this film we see how Michael completely begins to lose control of his family and friends. Michael, who I admired in the first film, has become so blind in his lust for power that he losses the strong values his father had taught him. He has grown cold, distant, and even goes as far as to hitting his wife (something Vito would never have dreamed of doing). The parallel story of young Vito and how he became a Don also works really well as it is told in flashbacks during Michael's present reign as Don. This story serves as a reminder of how distant Michael has become from what his father wanted of him. Part II is more of a nostalgic movie as we see the decline in the once strong and united Corleone family, and Nino Rota's score is a perfect example of that. The final scenes of the film only confirm this sentiment. The performance from the cast is as equally as brilliant as it was from the first, and Gordon Willis's cinematography is also equally impressive with its dark scenes that help set the mood of the film.The Godfather Part II continues where the first one left off with Michael (Al Pacino) as head of the Corleone family and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as his personal adviser and lawyer. They are living in Nevada now and running the gambling business in that state during the late 50's. While we follow the present storyline, Coppola introduces a series of flashbacks beginning all the way back in 1901 following the early life of Vito (Oreste Baldini) in Sicily. Vito's father, brother, and mother (in that specific order) have been killed by Don Ciccio (Giuseppe Sillato), but Vito is able to escape to New York. The film later jumps forward to 1917 where Vito (Robert De Niro) is making a living working as a clerk for a small store in New York. The movie jumps back and forth between both stories. On the one hand you have Michael trying to expand his empire traveling to Miami and Cuba, meeting with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), a successful Jewish businessman, who Michael isn't sure he can trust. On the meantime he has problems back home with his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), problems with Nevada Senator Pat Geary (G. D. Spradlin), and problems in New York with Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), Clemenza's replacement and friend of the family. After an attack on his life Michael isn't sure who is after him (or maybe he is and we don't know it). On the other hand, the other story continues to follow young Vito as he meets Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) and Tessio (John Aprea) and begins his imminent rise to becoming the Don.Marlon Brando was a huge part of the success of the first film, but Coppola, along with Puzo, did a great job introducing new characters to the story that contributed to the success of the sequel. Michael V. Gazzo as Frankie and Lee Strasberg as Roth were great in this film and gave it a fresh new look. Another contributing factor was the addition of the flashbacks because Robert de Niro was the right man to play young Vito. His Oscar winning performance was outstanding and he just stood out in every scene he was in. Al Pacino continued with his transformation in the first film, and now he portrayed a much darker and colder Michael. He didn't have to say anything and we already knew what he was feeling. There are several memorable scenes in which he speaks louder with his facial expressions than he does with his words. The opening scene in Nevada where the family is reunited celebrating Michael's son's First Communion is reminiscent of Connie's wedding scene in the first Godfather, and the same thing can be said of several other scenes as the final one. The sequel serves as a nostalgic memory of what the Corleone's once were (or at least what Coppola wanted us to think of them in the first romantic movie), it is much darker, but it still works and compliments the first part really well. The Godfather Part II is not better than the original, but it is still a masterpiece.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
shiznykid,"Oct 26, 2008",10/10,"this is something. if you thought The Godfather was special, brace yourselves, because The Godfather Part 2 is the greatest. Everything about this movie is perfect. the directing is brilliant. the way Coppola was able to weave two tales using only flashbacks was just groundbreaking. the acting, well it speaks for itself. De Niro won an Oscar for-this, and was richly deserved, but Pacino puts in the performance of his career, Duvall features much more and is marvelous. Cazale is picture perfect as the shaky Fredo. Bruno Kirby was my favourite as the straight talking Clemenza. All I'm saying is that this movie can do now wrong. the simple message of this movie is that of a man who has a firm grip on his job. but is losing his grip on his life"
FilmFanInTheHouse,"Apr 5, 2009",10/10,"The Godfather: Part II (1974, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)It's the 1920's and young Vito Corleone (De Niro) moves to New York to his life and new crime career, whilst in the future, his son Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) continues to further his father's legacy.Francis Ford Coppola pulls off another epic classic which this time focuses' on two different story lines. Al Pacino is just wonderful as always to watch, but Robert De Niro gets a mention for his amazing performance. The story remains at a steady pace and never goes off the tracks, making this a truly great film.I trust these men with my life, Senator. To ask them to leave would be an insult. – Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)"
otsoar,"Feb 18, 2018",10/10,"The Godfather is the mother of all mafia movies, and The Godfather part II is considered not just one of the best sequels of all time but one of the best films of all time. So you could say the expectations for this film were high.I saw the original Godfather a few months ago and while I liked it, it didn't feel to me as amazing as people make it out to be. Part II on the other hand grabbed me right from the start and I loved every minute of it.The film tells two stories simultaniosly. One is a direct continuation of the first film, in which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tries to balance his family life and leading the Corleone family's criminal empire. The other tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert deNiro) who is the godfather from the first film. The two different stories make the three hour run-time fly by. The slices we get of each story are perfectly paced in a way that makes every scene interesting.This film is also a visual masterpiece. The directing and editing are flawless and the production design is also amazing. The costumes and props bring the 50s and 1900s alive in a beautiful way. The score is also perfect for the film.All the performances are great, but Robert deNiro and Al Pacino go above and beyond in this movie. They are the final piece in the puzzle for telling the coming up-story of Vito and the tragic tale of Michael.It's films like this that truly deserve a ""perfect"" score of 10."
stallone-9,"Mar 22, 2008",10/10,"And that is saying a lot.Probably the most fantastic and well made sequel of all time.Some consider it to be even slightly better than the original but for me the first Godfather is still the best mainly because of Marlon Brando.Despite of that The Godfather part 2 is a flawless movie,a timeless masterpiece with countless qualities that crabs the viewer and never ceases to impress.Al Pacino delivers simply a stunning performance and deserved an Oscar for best actor.Here he isn't the fragile,insecure young man he was in the original film.Here he is wiser and more respectful.Perfect Michael Corleone.The rest of the cast is amazing too.Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and John Cazale as Fredo shine once again.Cazale as the treacherous Fredo has a bigger role and makes an even greater impact on the audience.But a lot of the credit has to go to the brilliantly cast Robert De Niro who indeed deserved to win the Oscar for best supporting role.His portrayal of the young Vito Corleone and his rise to power is simply stunning.Excellent work.Director Francis Ford Coppola is simply one of the greatest directors not only of his time but of all times and shows once again that he is the biggest fan of the novel and shows great respect both towards Mario Puzo and his work."
Zooha-47207,"Apr 12, 2024",6/10,"The Godfather Part II, a sequel often regarded as one of the greatest in cinematic history, garners a 6/10 from me. While the film maintains the rich storytelling and exceptional performances of its predecessor, its extensive runtime can be a hurdle for some viewers.Similar to its predecessor, The Godfather Part II delves deep into the intricacies of power, family, and ambition. The dual narrative, juxtaposing the rise of Vito Corleone with the reign of his son Michael, adds layers of complexity to the story. The performances, particularly Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone, are captivating and memorable.However, like the first film, The Godfather Part II suffers from pacing issues due to its extended length. While the depth of the narrative is commendable, the slow pacing can make it a challenging watch for those seeking a more streamlined experience. Additionally, the film's non-linear structure may require extra effort from viewers to follow and appreciate fully."
mcjensen-05924,"Jul 24, 2021",5/10,"This was a wholly unnecessary sequel. The back story/history of Vito is barely touched upon, and really doesn't add much depth to the trilogy. Pacino fails to deliver to gravitas that Brando had, and we are treated to one mundane scene after another where people are discussing carpets and spouting inane cliched tripe. There's no drama of note, and quite frankly a half hour into this the dialogue was wearing very thin. A lot of the scenes were rehashed from the first movie done ineffectively and unoriginally. The 9 rating is definitely confounding to me because as a fan of the mobster genre this rang not only unbelievable but absurd in many cases. Not going to waste much more time here as clearly the 10 after 10 after 10 star rating will untimately rule the day. I had to double check to see that FFC actually directed this one, because honestly it didn't seem to me that the same person that directed the original Godfather could handle the sequel in such a clumsy way. I thought he would have treated it in a much more dignified and competent manner. The film looks good, sure. How could it not? The soundtrack was off to me, though. The live show scenes, because this is Vegas, were downright lousy and annoying. Not worthy of the praise heaped upon it at all. Watch the original again or Good Fellas. They're at least original. Also, WAY too long. I'm not even sure where the 5 stars are coming from....."
sickofenjoyingmyself,"Jan 29, 2015",10/10,"This is, for me, one of the greatest of all time. Any sequel to the original - again - one of the all time greatest - was always going to be tough. But to follow it with such a timeless masterpiece is nothing short of astonishing. The acting all round is utterly electrifying - from the big performers to the bit part players and extras. Each part is played to perfection. This is one of those rare movies that is totally complete. Words can barely do it justice. You could watch it a thousand different times and take a thousand different lessons from it. You could notice something each time that you hadn't spotted before. This is cold, unforgettable and absolutely absorbing. If you haven't seen it before - go and watch it. If you have seen it before - go and re - watch it. I'm not sure we'll ever see anything that matches it's like again."
OllieZ,"Jan 15, 2007",10/10,"Without a doubt, Coppola made four of the best films of the 70's. The Godfaher Part 1, Part 2, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Out of these, The Godfather Part 2 remains my favourite.It continues the Corleone family tale, of greed and corruption and yet Part 2 adds another vein to the bloodstream of this biblical tale; the story of Vito Corleone and his arrival in New York. The cinematographer, Gordon Willis creates a sepia-washed dream of a New York. Every shot is sumptuous ad full of depth - the production value was a help too, with some of the most authentic streets scenes ever committed to film.Though, as wonderful as the film looks, the acting is stellar to. De Niro completely transforms himself from the urban maniacs like Johnny from Mean Streets and Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, to form Vito Corleone, the younger Marlon Brando. De Niro doesn't over cook the character, instead he simmers; his eyes tell two tales, one of being content, the other of contempt, for the killing of his family.De Niro is backed up by great co-stars, such as Bruno Kirby who played the young Clemenza. The story itself in this section of the film is slow burning, much like the rest of the film, yet is here to serve a contrast to the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada.This is the part in the trilogy where Michael transforms from the ""college boy"" and ""war hero"" of part 1, into the heartless, muted confusion that he embodies here. Pacino plays the part with ease and never goes wild and shout, much like his later work (Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather Part 3...). Keaton is superb as the WASP wife, Kay, who tries to break free of the corruption she has married into. Cazale, who plays Fredo is wonderful too, a helpless, jealous character, who forms one of the best brother characters in film history. The co-stars are also great, with Strasberg as Hyman Roth.Just as Michael's family is dissolving, Vito's is just beginning. The two fragments of the Corleone history run side by side to depict the downfall of Michael's character. Constantly trying to please his dead father, Michael talks of family, but doesn't understand how to sustain it.A classic."
VikramMohan,"Mar 29, 2008",10/10,"I personally think that this film surpassed the glory of The Godfather I. you will have to watch it time and again in order to understand the nuances of it's brilliant film-making. the characterizations are exceptional: 1. Micheal Corleone (as the new don torn between family & business) 2. Hyman Roth (as the scheming old villain) 3. Kay Adams Corleone (as the worried wife) 4. Robert Duvall (as the loyal lawyer) 5. John Cazale (as the betraying brother) 6. Robert DeNiro (as young Vito) etc. etc.... It's just Brilliant!!! Speaking about the film-making the parallel narration of two different but interlinked stories is a fresh new lease of screenplay. the cinematography is outstanding. the indoors are lit up beautifully with overhead lighting which puts a shadow over the characters' eyes making it impossible to say what they're thinking. But unlike the first part where they had broken all the rules (the characters are established first before the place and time) in this film they've come back to the rules (the locations are established before the characters) Francis Ford Coppola should definitely be given another chance to make a sequel to the trio-logy so that the present generation can also experience the 'Magic of the Movie' and for anyone who's not seen this film, I bet they're surely missing something in life..."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Jul 20, 2004",10/10,"It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10"
arthurclay,"Jul 2, 2005",10/10,"Critics to be better than the original artistically at least. I am still not sure myself but they may be right. It continues the legacy of the Corleone Family and digs into the roots of their criminal empire. There are a series of flashbacks and that could be confusing to some and to be honest I'm not sure that was positive for the flow of the picture but who am I to criticize that. There is more violence here than in the first Godfather and several scenes, like the original, feature real life events. I personally like the first one better probably because of Brando but I will watch both without reservation. Pacino shines here as brightly as in the first one and DeNiro gives it some much needed weight to replace or more accurately continue Brando's character. It is also much sadder than the first in my opinion and shows the misery and depravity of young Vito's life and why he was what he was. It is a true masterpiece."
Boba_Fett1138,"Nov 5, 2009",10/10,"As far as sequels are concerned; they just don't get any better than this. As a matter of fact ""The Godfather: Part II"" even ranks above the sublime ""The Godfather"", which got made 2 years earlier, starring mostly the same cast.The movie connects nicely with the first movie and decides to start off were the first movie had finished. Michael is the new Don now and he continues his father work by leading a crime syndicate based in New York. Besides the usual struggles with other the other families and other characters who are looking for opportunities to gain more power and control, Michael also needs to handle his personal life with his wife and his other family members, who aren't all on the same line.But ""The Godfather: Part II"" is not just a movie that continues what the first movie had started. It also adds a story-line of the young Vito Corleone, played in the first movie by Marlon Brando. In this movie he is being portrayed by Robert De Niro, who wasn't really a big star yet at the time. It's amazing how these two different story-lines, set at completely different time periods and also in essence have really nothing to do with each other, blend in so perfectly. The historical settings of the New York of the early 20th century are also truly impressive.It's a movie that got practically made by the same cast and crew as the first successful movie. Of course there also are some new addition to the cast this time, in which the earlier mentioned Robert De Niro and Lee Strasberg impress the most. Both also received an Oscar nomination in the category for best supporting actor, along with Michael V. Gazzo but it was Robert De Niro who would eventually take the statue back home.What also makes this movie an even better one than its predecessor is the fact that this movie is filled with some classic moments of cinema. It contains some of the best known sequences and phrases. It also contains some great constructed and build-up sequences, for which the credit really needs to go to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the characters are more developed and expanded in this movie. A true accomplishment for a movie with so many characters in it but then again the movie has also more than 3 hours to tell its story.A sequel that even surpasses its brilliant predecessor.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Dolchi,"Jun 10, 2022",7/10,"Every once in a while, people always ask us to look at things from a different angle. ""People become criminals because of the circumstances and not are mostly not inherently evil"". We see no such pleading in the film.. Coming after the release of the very successful first half, the movie tells the backstory of the patriarch.We can see the setting of the United States when the first wave of immigrants had rushed to New York City from the Old World. Rather than being intriguing as the first film, this delves headfirst into telling the story of how power was built from almost nothing.I saw this film only for the excellent acting and direction. Apart from this, I do not condone violence or organised crime, much like almost everyone who rate these films highly. Yet, I still feel bad that such films were at times misused by ""Cosa Nostra"" as propaganda for hiring men."
Hotwok2013,"Aug 7, 2014",N/A,"""The Godfather Part 2"" is that rarest of movies in that it surpasses a really brilliant first movie. Shown in flashbacks it shows the rise of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) in New York City & alternates forward to his son Michael (Al Pacino) who eventually succeeds him as head of the Corleone mafia family. De Niro & Pacino are two of the greatest movie actors of all time but I have to say that, to my mind, De Niro is just fantastic in his role. Great too is Robert Duvall as family lawyer & counsellor Tom Hagen. John Cazale who plays Michael's brother Fredo is also excellent. He had the misfortune to die of cancer at only 42 years of age but the good luck to appear in only five 1970's movies all of which are regarded as classics. For anyone who has never seen this movie do so at the first opportunity because there is no doubt it is one of the greatest, (some say THE greatest), movie ever made. As a piece of celluloid storytelling it remains unsurpassed."
RohitRajkumar,"Aug 14, 2009",10/10,"There are bound to be comparisons to 'The Godfather',but it definitely comes close to surpass its predecessor but to no avail.But that doesn't take away any credit from another gem from Francis Ford Coppola.There would have definitely been immense pressure on Coppola to deliver the second time after the first one was a huge hit.Robert De Niro was outstanding as the young Don Vito Corleone and truly deserved his Oscar.John Cazale delivers on getting more screen space.But I was disappointed to see that Al Pacino as Michael Corleone after having overshadowed his previous work in the first and having reached greater heights in this one, did not get an Academy award.The film does not disappoint and matches the original in every aspect.Truly outstanding cinema."
gavin6942,"Oct 16, 2006",9/10,"Seven years after the first film, Michael Corelone (Al Pacino) continues his family's quest to become legitimate. Also, more on his father's growing up in Sicily and coming to America. With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didn't, you won't. It's really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone? I cannot make any suggestions for part three, though, one way or the other."

From the crushed linen shirt sleeve through to the left to ponder at the supper table and everything in between (especially Mr De Niro) this film has my attention and admiration in a race of appreciation. Sicily, New York, Nevada, Cuba- wherever the scene is laid it does not fail. From the spirit and determination of Vito to the decay and decline of Michael this film is an engraving of cinematic blessing. Thank you Francis and all who participated! Salut"
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Jun 22, 2008",10/10,"The most brilliant thing about ""The Godfather: Part II"" is that Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola has seamlessly extended the original, and when I say seamless, I mean that Coppola has created a sequel that looks and feels like the original and actually makes the first film better. If I could, I would go back and change my rating of ""The Godfather"" to an 11 and make this a 10. With the exception of the Lord of the Rings films (and even that series didn't win two best pictures), no sequel can say that it strengthens the original film and that's why ""Part II"" is so good.At an epic 200 minutes long yet rarely boring, ""Part II"" tells not only the story of Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) as he takes over the family, but simultaneously tells the background of Don Vito Corleone (DeNiro) who was played by Brando in the original. To the modern viewer, DeNiro feels like a gimmick, but this was his first prestigious role and he is quite convincing as a younger version of Brando's performance. Leading man Pacino is incredibly commanding yet again as Michael as this time we see the weight of being Don grow heavier and heavier on his shoulders. As usual, it's too difficult to explain the ""business"" plot of the film, which has plenty of double-crossings and twists that the pervasive feeling of paranoia that is so ingrained in the original continues quite masterfully in this film.The acting talent is across the board so good that you have to give casting team and Coppola some of that credit. This film had three best supporting actor nominees at the Oscar's for goodness sake. If the Golden Globes that year had the best ensemble category, this film would have won it hands down. My personal favorite is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I would trust him with my life too.Everything about this film is so well done (especially the set design for New York, Italy, Cuba, etc) that it's hard to notice sometimes because you're so drawn in to the plot and following it. Coppola makes you think something tragic can happen at any second and when it does, it always delivers. The ending sequence is something that directors have stolen left and right when trying to make their ending just as powerful. While ""The Godfather"" has more memorable scenes and dialogue, this film is a masterpiece in its own right despite not having as much glitz as the original.Of course, in terms of themes, ""The Godfather: Part II"" continues to address the original's themes in new and meaningful ways. The themes of what family truly is and means get expanded upon and become so complex as seen through Michael's relationship with his wife and brother Fredo. The back-in-time plot arch with Vito sheds additional light on the ""Michael"" part of the film as well. All of it just makes ""Part II"" a rock-solid classic."
proud_luddite,"Jun 8, 2019",9/10,"Both a prequel and a sequel to ""The Godfather"", this film tells parallel stories in different time periods. The early one takes place in the early 1900s when Vito Corleone escapes a traumatic childhood in Sicily and becomes part of the crime scene in New York City . The later story in the 1950s has Vito's son Michael taking over the family's business of organized crime.As both crime drama and family drama, this film earns high marks in both categories. The later story includes a patriarch who is so ruthless and power-hungry that it would normally be tempting to despise him and those around him. Yet, the skillful directing by Francis Ford Coppola successfully tricks the audience into showing great interest to the clan almost to the point of sympathy.The later story is sometimes difficult to follow. It's extremely busy with many details and characters that are sometimes difficult to follow and remember. Luckily, the earlier story is straightforward. Each story is enhanced with differing styles of photography by the very talented Gordon Willis. The music of Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola is also beautiful.Despite the mentioned flaw, this film has so much talent involved that it ends up as a memorable experience even after multiple viewings. The supporting cast members John Cazale, Michael Gazzo, Lee Strasberg, and Talia Shire all have at least one scene that gives them a chance to shine. As Vito, Robert DeNiro shows greatness in the role that brought him to fame. But the highlight of the cast is Al Pacino as Michael who personifies the worst side of humanity in subtle ways especially in two scenes. In one, where he has a serious confrontation with his wife, his still face can't fully betray his anger as his jaw shakes. In another scene, he is viewed from a distance behind a glass screen door. Even at a distance, his silent pose conveys soullessness and evil.Coppola's directing is at its best in crowd scenes, particularly a street festival in the earlier story where a murder is being planned; and a New Year's Eve party in Havana in the later story. Overall, ""The Godfather Part II"" has aged very well. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 9 out of 10Outstanding Achievements:Directing by Francis Ford CoppolaActing by Al Pacino."
heisenberg12,"May 2, 2022",9/10,"The acting, cinematography, storytelling, writing, and editing are all better than the original. It feels more polished and mature in these categories than the first. This feels more like a masterpiece than the first one. Everything from the ending, the nuances, certain high drama scenes all feel more powerful and meaningful. Surely though, many will prefer the original but not me. This is the better movie, imo.9/10."
jmlawton,"Mar 6, 2012",N/A,"I have been forced to watch the Godfather trilogy by a friend of mine who thinks, as do most people, that they are the best thing since sliced bread. I found ""The Godfather"" just about watchable, but no more - I would have given up if my friend hadn't been there, but this was completely intolerable. I couldn't follow who the people were (and didn't care) I couldn't relate it to the previous film. I couldn't relate the 1930s stuff to the 1950s stuff. There is no excitement no tension, no nothing. A complete waste of an evening. And it's so interminably long too. I'm having trouble filling out my ten lines for the review, because the film left almost no impression on me - except that feeling that I used to get at school when I was forced to sit through the most boring lesson in the world. And God help me, I'm going to have to watch the third one. Like taking cod-liver oil. Ugh."
ebiros2,"Jan 24, 2006",10/10,"This is one of the few movies where the sequel is better than the original. Cinematography is better than the original, and story line tighter. The story is about change of guard from the old Corlione (Vito) to the new God father (Michael), and I thought acting by both Marlon Brando and Al Pachino was notch above the original. The unlikely son who went to college and had no interest in the family business now takes over the family as the new Don. Al Pachino shows his maturity as an actor by playing the role of the new Don masterfully, and his transition from his first role to that of the new God father is portrayed naturally.This is one movie I believe will last till the end days of cinema. A classic in its own right."

kierenamand,"Sep 15, 2019",10/10,"This film is not a sequel to the first, its so much more than that. Its difficult to compare the two films against one another but they both sit in the top 5 films ever made - and that says enough.Watching how Micheal is dealing with taking over the family is exciting yet you can't help but feel a little bit sorry for him as he never wanted this life. Seeing how he has to hold the family together with fear is even more disturbing as we flash back to seeing his father create the family with love.De Niro is amazing as a young Don Vito and rightfully won an Oscar for his performance.Easily a 10/10. Greatest Mafia film made."

doding143,"Feb 16, 2018",10/10,"His movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power ."
tuanphamhung,"Mar 6, 2022",10/10,"I liked it better than the first one, but I still think it's overrated. It is unfair that Pacino didn't win an Oscar for the role of Michael, because he definitely deserved one."
AnirbanGoswami1,"May 14, 2020",10/10,"When Al Pacino,Robert De Niro are in the movie,you don't have to think twice how the movie will be.Actually this movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other.It is a film which does better than its predessor, ""The Godfather"". The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless.Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances. Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music. The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb."
xiaoli7377,"Jul 12, 2022",10/10,"""The Godfather: Part II"" outdoes the original film in almost every way. This isn't even up for debate. And the original is still a classic. This one is simply better. It keeps all of the high quality acting and screenwriting and throws us a curveball by intertwining the continued story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) with the early story of his father, Vito (Robert De Niro). Unfortunately, Marlon Brando does not make an appearance in this film.The great thing about this film is that it gives us a dichotomy of the father's rise and the son's fall. Showing parallel stories but also showing the stark differences between Vito's altruism and sense of justice and Michael's ruthlessness and lust for revenge. It's a marvelous movie that really opens up a lot of room for interpretation on its portrayals of organized crime, family, and the American dream. This is one of the must watch films."
lionesss,"Nov 3, 1998",10/10,"Robert De Niro is so good an actor that his name itself has become a word in our language.  (A good actor, of course.) The way the stories of Vito and Michael are linked is seamless. Al Pacino is not only my favorite actor but also much too good-looking for his own good. The moment he realizes who the traitor is- WOW.  That instant captured on film-- it is immortal."
Journey_with_a_Cinephile,"Dec 17, 2022",10/10,"Where I should start here is that this is a classic. I saw this around the time that I watched the original one which would have been late in high school. My buddy Craig and I decided to seek out the great 'mob movies'. I've seen this a few times with the most recently with Jaime as we are working through the Internet Movie Database poster. She had never seen this one.For this one, we take place years after the original one. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) oversees the family. He has sole control of the criminal organizations after the events of the earlier movie. He is still trying to realize the dream of his father to go legit. It has taken longer than he told his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton).This also shows us the event that led to his father, Vito (Robert De Niro), becoming the man that we see in the original. We see the humble beginnings in Sicily and how he ended up in New York City. We also see how he became the 'godfather' and gaining the respect of the neighborhood.Michael also has problems to deal with, which are keeping the peace within his own 'family' with Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) and with Kay. He also is expanding into Cuba with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg). It can be difficult to know who he can trust, even with those that are within his group.There isn't a lot more that I have to say here. Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote this with the writer of the novel Mario Puzo. Coppola also directs. This is a masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing. We have another all-star cast. This also does something interesting in showing how Vito became who he is and how these correlates to what Michael is dealing with. It is almost a mirror of the first one. Michael is now Vito so the rise we see here is Vito becoming the powerful man that he is. The only other thing to bring up the soundtrack which fits spot on with the tone and giving it that Italian vibe.If I have a gripe, this is a long movie. It doesn't necessarily feel the whole three and half hours but I do think there is some that could be trimmed personally. This doesn't ruin the movie. Don't get me wrong. I think I prefer part one to this sequel. They both are as perfect a movie as you can get to me though.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10."
TheOneThatYouWanted,"Aug 12, 2017",6/10,"There has been an argument raging for year about which is the better movie, Part one or Part two. It isn't even a contest. Part one is a much much muchhhhhh better film. If you took away the Robert De Niro's scenes, you can make the argument that this movie is in fact a bad film. Frankly De Niro saved this movie. Without the flashbacks this film is uninteresting and boring. Even the actors look bored. Sure, some parts of the plot are interesting but overall the execution this good enough to honestly make you give a sh!t. The first Godfather movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie on the other hand is one of the most overrated movies of all time. The next time I watch it I'm just going to save myself time and fast forward to the De Niro parts."
pilot1009,"Nov 11, 2019",4/10,The original was good but this one just gets lost in convoluted flash backs and a too complex a plot with no real fullfilment. Also way too long. Dated now and I cannot understand the high scores reviewing it.

anthonywltrs,"Oct 8, 2022",9/10,"Although I may end up changing my opinion as I will be rewatching this one down the line and for many years to come, I just finished my first viewing of this and believe the first one is betterThe story in part 2 is great dont get me wrong, I loved the stories on the rise of Vito Corleone from when he arrived in America to becoming ' The Godfather' as seen in the first film and the other story focusing on Michael as the Don of the Corleone Crime Family as he tightens his grip on everything while dealing with a devastating betrayal and losing his family in the process. They were both interesting and I do love them both. But I just feel like the first is better as mostly any first movie in a trilogy or a series goesGreat cast of characters once again including Dominic Chianese who played Uncle Junior in The Sopranos in Godfather Part Two playing a great character called Johnny Ola. The cinematography is stunning once again and so is the soundtrack. I should point out I watched this movie online where it had no subtitles during scenes of Vito's story when talking in Italian which sucked so maybe that's why my first view of this film is as it is but I am getting the Trilogy on DVD very soon so maybe when I look back on this one again my opinion on Part Two will change and will be just as good if not better than the first one. If that is the case I will do another review. If not. You got this. Take it or leave it. Look forward to watching the last one tomorrow."

dommercaldi,"Oct 5, 2020",9/10,"Pros:
1. The score is utterly magical with its quintessentially Italian feel which adds so much depth to the film.
2. The movie does a masterful job at creating a stifling atmosphere of tension and suspense, even with just the long silences and dialogue.
3. The set and costume design is brilliant, especially Michael Corleones' (Al Pacino) suits which just scream power.
4. The production is mind-blowing, particularly considering the scope of the film.
5. The transitions between the past and the present are perfect as they never miss a beat.
6. The violence feels incredibly raw and grounded in its execution which serves to harden its impact.
7. The scene where Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) comes clean to Michael Corleone about his betrayal is amazingly acted, particularly in regards to John Cazale, and it's exceedingly emotional.
8. Robert De Niro (Vito Corleone), Al Pacino, and John Cazale give phenomenal performances.
9. The ending sequence, like the one in the first film, masterfully ties everything together.Cons:
1. The movie skips over Michael Corleone's first 7 years as the Don, but it would have been great to watch him in action after he took up his father's mantle."

ivo-cobra8,"Oct 17, 2015",9/10,"The Godfather Part II (1974) is one of the best sequel's out there! Following the story right from the first film! I love this film as much a is love the first one. Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.The Godfather Part II presents two parallel story lines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone did do a strong lead and a wonderful perfect job he acted in this film superb and strong. Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone did a brilliant performance I have ever saw. He played an Italian immigrate superb and brilliant, there isn't any connection that he is American at all, his ascent is gone. It is like he was born an Italian by birth.I love this film Because you get both sides of the story, because you're able to see where De Niro's coming from, just seeing those guys in the movie. Again, I think there's something that, when a sequel can hit it right, to keep pushing, instead of, ""Let's capitalize on what we did the first time."" And for me, maybe one the first movies where I felt like, ""Ooh, we're getting a backstory."" That, to me, was really thrilling. And just to see those guys, that young and hungry. That's it, that is the right thing there. Coppola is at the top of his form in both films.Simply as a story, the Michael scenes in ""The Godfather: Part II"" engage our emotions. I admire the way Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he handles delicate decisions involving Hyman Roth (Strasberg), the boss of Miami; Fredo (Cazale), his older brother, and the shooting of Sonny (James Caan). Who has done what? Why? Michael floats various narratives past various principals, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess; he has to envision the moves without seeing them.But finally it is all about Michael. Even the attack on the night of his son's first communion party is on his bedroom, not our bedroom. His wife, Kay (Keaton), leaves him, and his focus does not waver: He will keep his son. Tom Hagen (Duvall), the most trusted confidant of father and son, considered a brother, is finally even suspected. In Michael's life, paranoia is a useful defense mechanism.Coppola shows Michael breaking down under the pressure. We remember that he was once a proud war hero, a successful college student, building a legitimate lifestyle. But on their wedding day, Kay first began to fully realize what an all-controlling cocoon the Corleone clan was. There would always be things she could not be told about, could not be trusted with. Finally Michael has no one to tell or trust except his elderly mother (Morgana King). Michael's desperation in that intense conversation explains everything about the film's final shot.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel crime dramas.The most memorable best epic Francis Ford Coppola's classic masterpiece sequel ever, the film stunned everything for brilliance to superb acting. I love this film to death, I love it!!!!!Score: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Robert De Niro, Talia Shire, Morgana King, John Cazale, Marianna Hill, Lee Strasberg Director: Screenplay: Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo Producer: Francis Ford Coppola Rated: R Running Time: 3 Hrs. 22 Mins.

diand_,"Jun 16, 2005",9/10,"With even the former director of the Actors Studio and proponent of method acting Lee Strasberg having one of the key roles this is one of the strongest acted movies ever. With Brando not present there seems to be more space for others. Especially De Niro impresses here because he had to take Brando's Godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). Both Strasberg and De Niro were nominated but De Niro won from the godfather of method acting.Part 2 is very well structured: Not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. But the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax.Again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. Only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify Michael's failed efforts to go legitimate. Once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1.Where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the Godfather family (not the empire). Whereas Vito stands for traditional, Italian values, Michael stands for modern, New World-values. The core of the story comes in the end, showing Michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. That's why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and he's in fact only excellent in 'business'."
Xstal,"Sep 9, 2022",7/10,"It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Al Pacino, although he would go on to play the same character in most of his future films, and the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they would also perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or a wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile."
krumski,"Jul 5, 2002",4/10,"I have an earlier review of this movie posted somewhere on this site in which I pretty much deconstruct it and its status as a ""classic sequel"" and even ""a great movie."" A handful of great scenes populate it, to be sure, and a spate of fine performances (particularly a toweringly great one from Pacino), but nothing that coheres into greatness - particularly as it's at the service of a turgid and convoluted plot.All of which I more or less stand by - at least as it befits my own taste and predilections. But I recently had some insight into why this sequel may be so well-respected: in its very dourness and lack of fire, it paints the unremittingly grim portrait of Mafia life that many apparently felt was missing from the first Godfather. I recently showed that movie to a group of my friends who had never seen it before (amazing in this day and age, no?) and they all enjoyed it - but, to a man, they felt that it definitely glorified and mythologized the violence it showed and the lifestyle it portrayed. Personally, I have a hard time seeing this - and, pay attention, because I believe here lies the discrepancy between the people who love the sequel and those who don't. On the most simplistic level, if you feel the first film glorifies the Mob - and feel at least slightly cheated because of it - you will most likely have an appreciation for the second film. If you feel, like I do, that the first movie sucks you into associating and sympathizing (hell, even *loving*!) these characters, but that the violence brings everything all back home and reminds you the evil and corruption which undergirds their way of life - then the second movie, though having perhaps some interesting elaborations upon this theme, offers nothing genuinely new. And is, therefore - despite all the evident care and superb craft involved - kind of a waste of time.But, since the violence and worldview depicted in The Godfather is such a polarizing issue, I suppose it was a good idea that Francis Coppola decided to have another go at it, ramming down his point for all those who didn't get it the first time: ""The Mob is BAD, it CORRUPTS YOUR SOUL, and NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT!"" These are good points to be made, and perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss them. I had just thought, previously, that . . . well, they're obvious (or should be, anyway - and anyone to whom they're not obvious is probably beyond all hope) and that the director had already made them once. Clearly, not everyone feels The Godfather makes those points cogently enough (as my friend says about the end of the first movie: ""Sure, Michael is cold, ruthless and lies to his wife - but DAMN, he's just the *man*!""). For those people, The Godfather Part II exists, and that's fine. I'll never speak ill of the movie again.Except for those flashback scenes - those are still terrible! Either they should form a completely different movie unto themselves, or they should be cut out entirely (watching the second film as part of ""The Godfather Saga"", where these flashbacks have been excised, is infinitely more rewarding to me). I still don't know what function they serve - if anything, they seem a throwback to the preciousness and romanticism of the first film, except far worse, in my opinion. But no one seems to agree with me, so I'll stop beating the tune on that one . . .But as long as I'm here and have got this movie in my sights for a second time (and am inclined to dwell on its strengths rather than its faults), let me just expand upon what I said earlier about the acting: the film is a veritable master's class in great acting, coming in all shapes and varieties. The coiled intensity of Pacino is complemented by an equally quiet yet forceful turn by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen (whose work in both Godfathers is some of the greatest, yet most unsung, in cinema history). Lee Strasberg does wonderful things with the Hyman Roth character, adding new layers and shadings in every scene, and his soliloquy to Michael about Moe Greene is as dead-on perfect as anything can be in this world. Similarly, Michael Gazzo takes a seemingly annoying and one-note character (Pentangeli) and works in so much depth and humanity, that at the end he's one of your favorite people in the entire Godfather story (doubly amazing, since he didn't have any automatic goodwill from the audience by being a carryover from the first film). The quiet scene between he and Duvall near the end is, in some ways, the most shocking, cold-hearted and violent of the whole series - and not one weapon is drawn, the two speaking in pleasantries the entire time, barely above a murmur. This, folks, is great acting - as well as sophisticated writing, all topped off by a director who has total confidence in the audience to get it, without his having to exaggerate or accentuate a thing. This is, simply, peerless moviemaking.Such peerlessness exists, for me, in doses rather than all the way through in The Godfather Part II. But to extrapolate from this that the film is somehow worthless is a mistake - one I must apologize for. Though I still stand by my assessment that, for me anyway, the second Godfather is largely ""unnecessary"", I am more aware and sympathetic to the larger purpose it serves for a good deal of the audience. And, necessary or not, it still has on show some absolutely top-notch cinema acting, writing and directing. Maybe it, unlike the first one, is an offer I *can* refuse, but having once accepted it, I'm there for the duration."

This film is a film that laments for loss and is full of bitter emotions.but this is also arguably one of the greatest sequels of all time to one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of favorite all-time films, and I wouldn't hesitate to call it better than the first movie. This movie excels at everything, especially when it comes to storytelling. and the devolution of Michael Corleone's humanity and morality. The film invokes emotion from us for many reasons from the sad but powerful score by Nino Rota, to the powerhouse acting from everyone in the cast especially from Al Pacino, a story that introduces the past effectively, a very shocking ending, tight editing, powerhouse directing by Francis Ford Coppola, and the list goes on and on. Sequels were not a commodity back in the day, and this sequel to the huge 1972 film The Godfather is one of the first of its kind. The success of this film is why today's movie business relies upon sequels to make money. Regardless, this is one of the greatest films of all time.This film continues the saga of the Corleone family as we continue from the events of the first film. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is trying to expand the family's business into places like Hollywood and Cuba. His character takes a dive as he clashes with his brother Fredo (John Cazale), his lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), and his sister Connie (Talia Shire). He is suspicious of his business associates activities such as folks like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) and Frankie Pentangeli (Michael Gazzo). But this film incorporates another story into this story: the past. We meet Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) when he was growing up in Sicily and emigrates to New York City where be becomes connected with the mob life.I loved how the story is told thanks to the masterful storytelling by screenwriter Mario Puzo and director Coppola. They successfully tell two stories over the course of the movie without any trouble. Each story complements each other very well. The continuing saga of the present day family remains a high point. Of course the central character is Michael Corleone. The first film he was a man reluctant to take over the family business, but now he is turning into a control monster who trusts no one, not even his inner circle. It's a sad thing to watch as his morality crumbles and the final scene-one of cinema's most famous scenes, makes the case to show why Michael Corleone turns into a monster.I enjoyed the flashback sequences featuring young Vito. De Niro absolutely nails his role as Vito and he inherits the older Vito's mannerisms very well. It was fun to see how Vito turned into the man we knew him from the first film. The scenes in Sicily, where he is connected with a local mob boss is very powerful because Vito's mother was shot down. But that event helped turn Vito into the kind of man he was and to my happiness, Vito exacted the perfect kind of revenge. These scenes in Sicily and New York are beautifully shot and they really understood what New York was supposed to be in 1910.This is a film full of performances, all of them wonderful. Pacino excels as Michael Corleone once again. I really wish he won an Oscar for this role because he deserved it. His performance was effectively scary. Robert De Niro was absolutely amazing as the younger Vito and his role showed the kind of versatility this man has. Diane Keaton was effective as Kay. This film has Kay standing up to his man as she eventually leaves his side. Duvall is always great as Tom Hagen. John Cazale has a bigger part in the second film, as he tries to do what's best but simply does not have the brains and ultimately pays the price. His performance was a powerful one. Then we have the likes of the little known actors who gave an impression like Lee Strasberg who played the business partner Hyman Roth who wants Michael killed and Michael Gazzo who plays Frankie, a relative and associate of Michael's.The Godfather Part II is one of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather is an amazing film, but this one may just be a tad better. That is a rarity because 1.) Just look at the quality of the first film and 2.) sequels are rarely better than the original film. Speaking of sequels, this is the only sequel to this day that has won Best Picture at the Academy Award. Indeed, it's a very amazing feat. Although to be taken with a grain of salt, but on the website IMDb, this movie is ranked #2 of all-time. That goes to show the commercial value of the movie. I loved this movie for many reasons. From Al Pacino's wonderful performance to the chill-inducing score by Nino Rota. There was also a flashback sequence that hearkens back to the first movie as it brings back James Caan although Marlon Brando declined because he felt under-appreciated. Anyhow, Coppola does an amazing job with the first two movies in the series. That end shotjust wow.My Grade: A+"
richardchatten,"Aug 17, 2023",9/10,"Although the casual way it has been titled leaves it with plenty to answer for, 'Godfather II' rightly remains the only sequel ever to win an Oscar for Best Picture of the year.With Brando out of the picture the focus has shifted to Michael and much more money was obviously available to spend on the movie itself (with plush production design and cool fifties cars gliding across the screen a recurrent motif).Robert De Niro as the young Don Corleone brings a lean and hungry look to the part by then completely beyond Brando (by comparison Al Pacino looks much older).The film is far more ambitious, both technically and thematically, addressing America's changing role in the world rather than just the activities of one family."
ioandelice,"Jun 28, 2018",10/10,A masterpiece! The perfect sequel. My favorite out of the series.
Uriah43,"Aug 30, 2020",9/10,"This film essentially begins in Sicily with a young ""Vito Andolini"" (Oresti Baldini) having just lost his father and witnessing his mother also being murdered by a local Mafia chieftain. Knowing that he is now a target as well the 9 year old boy escapes on a ship to New York and not long afterward arrives in Ellis Island where he is given the last name of ""Corleone"". The film then fast forwards 57 years with ""Michael Corleone"" (Al Pacino) presiding over a party for his young son's First Communion party in Nevada. As is customary he meets with those who need to see him with one particularly powerful person named ""Senator Pat Geary"" (G. D. Spradlin) using the opportunity to attempt to extort some money from him. Little does he know just how vicious Michael actually is and the senator soon changes his tune not long after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film constantly shifts its attention from the now grown ""Vito Corleone"" (played by Robert DeNiro) to his adult son Michael after he inherited the title of Godfather from his father. To that effect, although I didn't particularly care for the repeated flashbacks, the stories of both individuals are so riveting that it didn't really matter that much to me. Likewise, while sequels often fail in comparison to the original film, many people feel that this particular picture is as good as its predecessor and the fact that it won an Oscar for ""Best Picture"" and received numerous other Academy Award nominations certainly strengthens that argument. On that note, while I agree that this is an excellent film, I have rated it just slightly below the original movie."

rajatdahiyax,"Aug 21, 2014",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption."
ymrbh,"Oct 8, 2024",6/10,"The Godfather, based on the original book by Mario Puzo was a extremely well developed story that resonated with so many people and turned into a cultural icon. There's drama, tension, it keeps you at the edge.This ""part 2"" is feels like hollywood trying turn a hit into a franchise.Unlike many scores here that praise this movie so much, I don't understand the hype. The movie is so boring and badly paced that I couldn't watch it in one session.They added a prequel story to explain Vito's origin and rise of his empire but because it needs to share the time with the aftermath of the first movie, they don't give it enough time to fully develop that story. They show a few things Vito does to raise his popularity but most of it is left for us to guess exactly how that happened.Michael's story is also badly developed, there's a conspiracy going on against him and at no point we're left to wonder who might be behind it, the movie just exposes some things but we're never part of Michael's thought process.In summary, this is two movies glued together into one competing for the viewer's time while not quite reaching any satisfying point of development for both of them."
Cineleyenda,"Sep 22, 2001",5/10,"The Godfather II is not nearly as good as Godfather I, even tho some intelligence and good acting went in.  After the Godfather I, and Michael's evolution is complete, who needs a sequel about unsavory characters so much? The Godfather I, led by Vito and Sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily).  Michael pales as an imposing figure next to Vito, and altho Al Pacino is a good actor, I just get tired of watching Michael too much--I was even getting a little tired of him at the end of Godfather I.  In other words, I think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here.  The end of Godfather II, with Michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially Michael himself.  I think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure.   And what is the point of Kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him?   And wasn't that ""abortion"" blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving?  Not to me.The main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse.  We have sordid characters (Hyman Roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of Fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and Connie.  This is a precursor to a lot of post mid-70s movies in which the plot is overcomplicated and not crisp and the characters sleazy and unappealing--in movies like this, I would like the characters to be less dwelled on and the action to rule.On the other hand, there is reason to be somewhat interested in the development of Vito and the flashbacks of the family.  Robert DeNiro does a good job as Vito, and the screenplay is thoughtful, but ultimately the main story dominates.  Yes, it is true, modern movies are less uplifting than ones preceding the mid-60s, but in spite of the many elements that some people complain about--violence, corruption, sex, pomposity, ridiculously overdone and confusing special effects--there are often some redeeming or uplifting features.  Certainly none here, and this film is depressing and sometimes boring, in spite of some good individual scenes and substance here and there to the story and characters.  To each his own--I can see why some people like this movie more than I do, but I really do not think it belongs on a pedestal either."

lambiepie-2,"Jul 2, 2003",10/10,"This should have NEVER happened.The Godfather part one was a wonderful film in 1972. We got to know the family, the business, the violence.In 1974, Francis Ford Coppola does a sequel. And it's just as brilliant as the original.I'm writing this in 2003 which will definately go down in film history as ""The Year of the Sequels"" and not one of those will come near this rare occurance of an epic of a saga. The real term here is ""saga"".I got the feeling watching that ""The Godfather part two"" was NOT done for ""sequel's"" sake. It was done to complete a story, to answer questions and to get into your mind as to why things turned out for these folks the they way they did. Some things in the Godfather part two you never saw coming. That is the mark of good filmmaking...keeping you on your toes. A few things you KNEW were coming, you may have been upset to see why, but you watch to see HOW it will unfold.The Godfather part 2 gives you history about Vito and at the same time shows you how his youngest son Michael is taking hold. You're interested in both..watching the past and present unfold and realizing HOW their futures entwine. A rare film making experience.And even rarer than that, The Godfather part one is chosen best film of 1972, the Godfather part two is chosen best film of 1974. Both, deservingly so.I got to see The Godfather part 2 as a salute to Francis Ford Coppola on the Los Angeles based ""Z"" channel immediately following The Godfather part one. The only other film I sat this long through mesmerized and thrilled with at that time was ""Fanny and Alexander""... and when you're young, its HARD to sit still.The Godfather Part 2 is a rare film indeed, another to include in the top 25 of all time."
eagandersongil,"Sep 4, 2016",10/10,"It is very difficult continues a perfect work, but coppola succeeded, ""the Godfather, Part II"" may not be the perfect embodiment of cinema as its predecessor, but it is a spectacular film, as sublime photographs, screen elements of this trilogy are perfect, all the features of the characters, the extras, to the furniture contrasts with the scene, and the soundtrack of this film is something amazing, I discussed in my previous review of part I on the technical part of the film, which is still impeccable, along with the performances, good, if not here we have Marlon de niro, who although are Supla lack godfather, leaves us stuck in its moments of action, and Al Pacino, well, forget it .... the only sin here is the script, which although very good, contrasting the beginning of the corleone family to its maximum moment of crisis, but the script does not hold as the first, and at times becomes confused, and has 20 minutes more movies , which in a way are put to good use, and in the end he presents us with a scene set credit, to stay in our heads during the I5 years to part III, watch this trilogy is more than a movie, it is to learn about cinema."
ajkbiotech,"Apr 5, 2021",10/10,"A fine film that in truth is finer in many ways than the first.The recut of both films into a sequential seven hour plus single Director's Cut sort of proves the point of the vast scope of Coppola's original vision, which Bob Evan's vetoed after he viewed the first cut of GF1, a very famous story.So the original film got cut in two, and the first film was the result of many edits.But still we got two brilliant films.And again, I read the book by Puzo before I saw either film.Coppola & Puzo did a masterful job of adapting the book to the screen.Finally, we see in these two films, great performances from actors destined to be generational greats-DeNiro, Pacino, Caan, et al., plus the tremendous final brilliant Oscar performance of Marlon Brando. Actresses Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, et al. Are equally brilliant.Two brilliant films."
ofpsmith,"Mar 19, 2015",10/10,"The Godfather is a fantastic movie. It's one of the most celebrated in history and it has gone down in history as one of the best films ever made. And much of that can be repeated to be said in The Godfather Part 2. In this film it showcases Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the new don of the Corleone crime family. It also shows the early life of Don Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) Michael's father and the celebrated Godfather. Michael's story involves his rise to power . Vito's story involves his early start in the business after he is forced into the US from Italy as a child. The two stories are told in a parallel fashion. And both of them are what makes the film great. The two stories are helped by the great acting ability from Pacino and De Niro both. If you liked the first one watch this one. Even if you haven't seen the first one, you should still watch The Godfather Part 2 because it is a great movie in it's own right."
RonellSowes,"Nov 8, 2020",7/10,"Often this film is listed as the sequel to The Godfather,which it is to an extent, but yet it also serves as a prequel. Francis Ford Coppola blended the two storylines together as well as one could with two that are so different. However, was the Vito origin story really essential ? As the film follows Michael's descent into evil it cuts back to how Vito became The Don which feels like more of a distraction than anything. With a total runtime of two hundred and two minutes the Vito storyline at forty six minutes doesn't even make up a third of the film. In those forty six very little happens and for the most part the camera just meanders around him living his poor,Italian immigrant life.
Then on the other side there's Michael. The film starts off a little while after the end of the original and Michael has moved the family to Lake Tahoe and is now a wicked,emotionless gangster. And that's pretty much how the rest of the story is.
Unlike the original which has a far more structured story this one really is just scenes that observe Michael's life over a period. In the beginning an attack is made on his life which he works to solve and avenge. First he tries to kill the man responsible which fails but in the process he learns that Fredo was involved. It also causes one of his friends to turn on him which leads to another small series of events. And don't forget, throughout we have the young Vito scenes which feel like unnecessary deleted scenes in an extended edition.Although the overall constitution of this film is inferior to the previous, Coppola still injects some of the style of The Godfather in it. For instance, the scene in which Michael presumably forgives Fredo and walks out to embrace him the camera focuses on Michael looking past his brother and at one of his guards who understands his order. Al Pacino also deserves credit as well.
If there's one thing that's as consistently good as the first its Pacino. He brings the same quiet,cold brooding he did before that's so full of nuance. It's hard to imagine that this subtle,hushed actor became such a ham.
Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone is possibly the greatest performance in film history and they were some pretty big shoes for DeNiro to fill. And while that part of the film may not be good he still gives a strong performance-at least as good as someone who's name doesn't start with Marlon and end with Brando can.As I close out this review I might as well mention the ending scene,which I found the best in the film. Michael sits down on a bench and flashes back to him waiting for his father on his birthday along with Sonny,Fredo,Connie,Tom Hagen and Carl.It also happened to be Pearl Harbor and Michael announces he's enlisted in the Marine Corps to the anger of Sonny and Tom Hagen's shock;Fredo of course congratulates him before he's silenced by Sonny. They hear Vito arrive and go to greet him leaving Michael thinking alone at the table and then the park bench. It's the best note in an uneven composition."
StarVVars,"Jan 18, 2004",1/10,"While the first movie had a lot of freshness and intensity, this movie is explaining the rise of Vito and Michael with more detail and explanation, so that it is taking a much longer breathing to say it. The mixture of past and present may work for some, but it didn't work for me. I had the feeling the film was repeating itself constantly with past and present, even when the scenes with Vito Corleone weren't that good and a bit too cliché and strangely comical. I don't understand why this film is rated to high."

EdwardtheBlackPrince,"Mar 25, 2022",9/10,"The Godfather: Part II one of the most critically acclaimed sequel of all time The concept of a sequel being good has always been a bizarre concept. Not only to be recognized as one the best sequel ever, but to even top the original is a master Accomplishment even for back then. The Godfather part II continues the story of the Corleone Family. Michael Corleone( Al Pacino) tries to expanded his family empire only to come to gripes with the hardship of what it really means to be the Godfather. While the other half of the film as he reflects. We see the life and coming of age of his father Vito(Robert De Niro) as a criminal. The first movie became a sensation for its gripping story telling and very Romantic yet realistic tone. It's sequel captures all that in every way as Michael evolution and complexity of his character descend deeper. Al Pacino captured the essence of this man you has descend deep in this dehumanizing manner here. It's completely shows that this is not at all the same Michael you knew from the first film. He a completely different person and who reach that point where he will make those unforgiven decisions. You see how he he sort of reach that point with his business and his family. The scene of his father serve as a way a self reflection in a way. How would my father deal with this? He doesn't have that same tier status as his old man did. He's not as respected and feared the same way. As for Vito scenes they were a excellent touches to not only Michael's character, but also Vito. Where's the first film While marlon Brando killed his role and made Don Corleone Iconic. The first film you didn't really know anything about him, but he still had the honorable crime lord feeling to him. Here you actually do get some pieces of what the kind of man he was in his youth and they also a relevant with Michael journey. Not much to say about De Niro he was perfect casting having the voice and mannerism down of Brando it felt believable that this it the same man in his youth. The Tone is still dramatic and investing with death, scandal and betrayal. Nino Rota returned again for the soundtrack and it's just as somber and classy as the first and accompany the scene lighting and tone nicely."

troyputland,"Dec 6, 2015",10/10,"Pacino outdoes himself in The Godfather. He's just as powerful as Brando was in the role of The Don. Michael Corleone (Pacino) expands his cartel, making friends and enemies alike. Michael's story is spliced with his father's uprising. Vito is played by the mesmerising Robert De Niro. Vito's story could stand alone from Michael's, but both compliment the other in ways that cannot be described. Scenes end on cliffhangers. When one starts, we want to be back with the other. The Corleone family is corrupt, and Part II just shows how deep their roots run. This second act is more intense, more involving, incredibly climactic, leaving it's audience wanting more. Absolutely fine displays from Pacino and De Niro. The Godfather: Part II almost outdoes its predecessor."
bjornbouterse,"Jul 15, 2012",N/A,"About six months ago I watched the Godfather Part I and to tell you the truth I thoroughly enjoyed, It had good cast, good story but still not worth number two on IMDb's top 250 and technically every top 100 film list on the web but still I must give it some credit. However today 15.7.12 I layed my eyes upon the masterpiece of terrible films I mean it truly is shockingly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did.Robert De Niro's role: My second favourite actor of all time after Jack Nicholson who does proud in practically ever film I've seen with De Niro in until today. I mean what in Gods holy name did he win an Oscar for this pile of **beep** he wasn't even in half the film. Thoroughly disappointed, no wonder he didn't appear at the Academy Awards because he probably thought what the hell I am I doing winning an Oscar for the worlds most boring films ever. He probably felt embarrassed.How people and watch that film and actually enjoy it is beyond me. I don't think I am exaggerating either to be completely honest I only watched the film to the end to see if Michael Corleone died to boy was he getting on my nerves.I sorry if I have offended anyones opinion but if you want to sit and enjoy a film watch Pulp Fiction which by the way on paper if one worse that The Godfather Part II."
ozjeppe,"Dec 3, 2006",6/10,"NO, one shouldn't compare movies. But here, it's validated, since both part one and two are based on one book, so I WILL. And on its own, this one is just no match for part one. It's good; we have flawless production values and cinematography. Jumping between past and present works and mix of locations (wintry family residence and tropical Cuba) helps. But the major drawbacks are: 1. Its length. 2. Its stretched-out storytelling and protraction of many scenes, which made my attention and interest drop considerably. It is simply too draggy and meandering. I just FEEL so much more watching part one, because it cuts more to the chase - tighter, darker and deeper. This one seems made to sprawl - but stalls a bit too often.However, some of the characters develop nicely (more depth from both Keaton, Cazale and Shire) , and the family heritage is cemented every time we move to Vito Corleone's younger days. Make no mistake, it's fine, solid and an indispensable part of the whole saga, but sorry folks - it's no masterpiece to me.6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe."

Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Feb 9, 2018",8/10,"It's baggy, wholly unnecessary and doesn't hold a candle to the original but yet is also an example of one of the finest sequels of all time and a phenomenal piece of film-making regardless of its few flaws. The 'Godfather: Part II (1974)' is an oddity in more ways than one, since it simply shouldn't work but totally does. There's almost no way you could believe that the piece powers past the three-hour mark, which it does thanks mainly to its unneeded and honestly less interesting flashback plots seemingly disconnected from the main story. There's not a moment in the foremost narrative I'd suggest cutting even for a second, and even those flashback bits are breathlessly entertaining (in a much more instantly gratifying way than the slow-burning main narrative.) Every second of the picture adds up to an experience that seems sweepingly massive yet strangely intimate, an effortlessly engaging examination of the fall of an empire and the nostalgic sadness at the heart of a man whose soul is slowly turning to stone. 8/10."
tomgillespie2002,"Feb 5, 2017",10/10,"Of all the wonderful things that can be said about Francis Ford Coppola's American masterpiece The Godfather (1972), above all else the film is a masterclass in storytelling. It's essentially a classic, romantic story of family, loyalty and the passage of time, undercut with a dark, violent portrayal of what it takes to achieve the American dream. It told a detailed, complex, and often confusing story featuring a large ensemble of characters, but this only matched the complexity of what Coppola was trying to achieve. The director, adapting Mario Puzo's novel, famously had a torrid time at the hands of the producers, namely Robert Evans. Yet when the resulting three-hour epic became a box-office and award-season smash, Coppola would be given free reign if he was to helm a follow- up.The resulting three hour twenty minute sequel was the director grabbing his chance to have complete control and pouring all of his artistry into it. This wasn't to be another classical Hollywood tale, but one of corruption, greed and pure evil. I first saw The Godfather Part II around 20 years ago at the age of 12 when I was first allowed to start watching movies for grown-ups. Watching it now, having seen it a handful of times in between, it's a completely different movie to the one I remember. I remembered it as an ambitious gangster movie with quite shocking violence, chocked full of great performances by actors who are now giants in their field. What I see now is a sequel truly like no other. A movie that is somehow optimistic and pessimistic in equal measures; one that sees its lead lose his soul while his father gains his; and quite possibly one of the saddest movies ever made.At first, Part II mirrors the narrative of its predecessor, beginning with a grand wedding as the Don (now Al Pacino's Michael Corleone) makes his underlings sweat as they wait to greet the head of the 'family'. While the previous wedding was a joyous, boisterous occasion, this one is noticeably different. Of the family that remains - John Cazale's weak-willed Fredo; Talia Shire's gold- digging Connie - only the mother seems to be the same. The band doesn't even know any Italian songs. While Michael may have attempted to continue his father's legacy when he took over, the changing, capitalist world has driven him inward, isolating himself from everybody around him and drifting away from the Sicilian values of his father. He was once a proud war veteran with a bright future, but now he is solemn and aggressive, and becomes even more so when a hit on his home almost kills him and his wife Kay (Diane Keaton).His close brush with death only fuels his paranoia, and he must navigate perilous waters as he moves into business in Cuba with one his father's business associates Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who also happens to be backing a couple of brothers moving into Corleone capo Frankie Pentangeli's (Michael V. Gazzo) territory. Michael suspects a betrayer within his own ranks, suspecting everyone including his own family. It almost seems like a deliberately confusing plot to take in alongside Michael's descent into pure evil, and it may all be too overwhelming had Coppola not chosen to juxtapose this story with one of optimism and nostalgia; that of the young Vito Corleone's escape from a mafia boss in Sicily and his eventual arrival in America. There is infinitely more colour and hope in these moments, and while these scenes may gloss over Vito's own violent journey, it seems like Coppola is making a point about where he feels his country was heading. Of course, these flashbacks are made even more welcome by the astonishing performance from a young Robert De Niro.The Godfather Part II currently sits in between The Godfather and The Dark Knight as #3 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and while I have little faith in the accuracy of a list that relies so heavily on popularity, it must be one of the most difficult and uncompromising movies in there. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that so many people love it, given the lack of flashy moments of violence the genre is so popular for. It's an experiment that could have gone so horribly wrong, and one that certainly wouldn't have been made outside of the innovative 1970s. Yet Coppola gets everything spectacularly right, from the inspirational casting of the Oscar- nominated Gazzo and Strasberg, to the chilling penultimate scene which sees James Caan's Sonny briefly return. In that final moment we realise that Michael has always been alone, destined to carve his own path, while forever gazing into the past to ponder what could have been."
TheMovieDiorama,"Feb 25, 2018",10/10,"With many claiming it to be better than its predecessor. Racking up a runtime of 200 minutes, this behemoth is the longest theatrical film I've seen. For those of you who read my review on Part 1 would know that my only gripe was with pacing issues, particularly in its third act which dipped completely to a point where I became uninterested. With no Marlon Brando and a far superior runtime, does Part 2 better its predecessor? Drum roll please...The Godfather Part 2...is...the better chapter in this saga. Yes, everything that made the first so well acclaimed still exists here but with a much more detailed end result. The pacing was perfect. There was always something happening whether it be the Corleone family members just interacting with each other over family and business, or when the Don himself Michael conceptualises a thorough and genius plan to get him out of trouble. Then, in addition, Coppola brings in Robert De Niro to portray a young Vito Corleone depicting his rise to power in the mafia culture. This is interwoven brilliantly with the current story involving Michael, the two plots bounce off each other and further the rich developed characters that Coppola originally put on screen. The plenty of backstabbing as traitors lust for power and control makes for some tense and gripping moments in a bloated film. Many more exotic locations to spice up the cinematography, from sunny Havana to vintage Corleone. I appreciated the inclusion of the Italian language, Coppola could've forced the scenes to be spoken in English and yet he didn't in order to keep the authenticity of these characters. Everything I mentioned in Part 1 still remains. Coppola's direction is flawless, acting is masterful (particularly Pacino and De Niro), complex family narrative that left me compelled in every scene...I mean I could go on but there is no need to. The vast majority of reviews state everything that I'm describing here, which is why this is regarded as one of cinema's greatest films of all time."
imseeg,"Apr 7, 2019",10/10,"2 word advice: Watch it. Just watch it. Watch the restored 4K version if you can, the picture quality is breathtakingly gorgeous. This isnt a review by the way, it's just a long tribute to the brilliance of this work.For once a sequel is as powerful as the original. The Godfather part 2 is the proof. It is more elobarate, with a more detailed, complicated story, compared to the original. It has more character devellopment than part 1. Yet it definitely has a more saddening, melancholic mood as well. The original Godfather is like watching Spring, watching The Godfather part 2 however is like entering a never ending Winter. Part 2 is as powerful, as mesmirising and as brilliant as the original, but so saddening to watch. Sad, but beautiful.Director Francis Ford Coppola pulled of something no other director has ever achieved. He created 2 masterpieces of American cinema back to back, within 2 years. Coppola was a mad man in the seventies. Bordering on lunacy and also bordering on bankruptcy. Although one would think the enormous succes of the original Godfather made him a millionaire, he risked all his money for the sequel. That risk of investing all of his own money gave him a lot of creative control though, with consequentially terrific results.Just to mention one example in which director Coppola took risks no other director would dare take, I want to tell you about the Robert de Niro scenes shot in New York. The studio wanted to shoot these streetscenes on a cheaper indoor filmset, but director Coppola insisted he wanted to shoot on the streets of New York.This was not just a regular shoot, no way. Coppola cordoned off two entire city blocks for weeks on end. He redesigned the entire 2 blocks to make them look exactly like pre-war conditions. New Yorkers being New Yorkers were complaining about the inability to enter their own houses for weeks on end. The costs that cordoning off entire city blocks costed were skyrocketing. And for what purpose? Coppola wanted an authentic looking scene of merely a couple a minutes in which Robert de Niro would walk the streets of his neighbourhood.These scenes do look stunning, and because I know how many millions these few scenes have costed, I cant help but admire Coppola even more then I already did, for wanting to go to the limit in order to achieve ultimate credibility. And THAT is what the Godfather oozes in massive amounts: CREDIBILITY. Never before or after have life and love and the bonds of family been portrayed with such cinematic craftmanship and soul.Originally released in 1974. It was brilliant, mesmirising and taking my breath away back then. It still does, to this very day..."
stevojaxon,"Feb 24, 2020",10/10,"They improved Part 1 by making Part 2. As I said about Part 1, just watch Part 2 if you haven't already. This is movie making history that makes modern movies look ordinary."
Holt344,"Aug 30, 2021",10/10,"The Godfather Part II is an epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay he co-wrote with Mario Puzo. The first film is a masterpiece but the increased budget is only positive in the sequel as everything is improved immensely and I'm talking about the production design and bigger scope, the superb writing and direction is still there. Why is this film like it's predecessor regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? You can write a whole essay regarding that but there's a lot of things that makes it into the masterpiece it is, there's simply just so much attention to detail and the writing is some of the best I have ever seen. It's 3 hours and 22 minutes long, every scene matters, even the flashbacks as it ties everything up nicely at the end. If not for the excellent and award worthy editing, the two parallel narratives wouldn't really work but it works in such a brilliant way. It flows so well and you see how much the two writers (especially Mario Puzo) how they care about the story and its characters. Though they are hugely inspired by real people, you can just see how real these characters are as they are flawed and written as human as possible. Mario Puzo created a fascinating and truly mesmerizing story in his books, his and Francis Ford Coppola's work for the film trilogy is on the same level if not better. There's also some comedic scenes like the previous film, if not for the actors and their execution, it wouldn't be funny. Nino Rota returns to make the musical score and honestly, it's phenomenal like always, superb work that just hits you with its emotion. The Costume Design are top notch and so is the art direction, sets and locations. The cinematography is excellent and mesmerizing, visually this is an incredible film, much thanks to
Gordon Willis. This film shows Francis Ford Coppola at his best, he created a masterpiece. It's considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and became the first sequel to win for Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He got robbed of the Oscar, his performance is brilliant in every way and tops even Robert De Niro's phenomenal performance, it might also be Pacino's best performance of his entire career. Robert De Niro won an Oscar for his performance and I'm behind that 100%, he lived in Sicily for three months and spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian language in order to play Vito Corleone, that's how he prepared for the role.It is the second installment in The Godfather trilogy. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone, the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life and as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba; the prequel covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone, from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. The Godfather Part II has many characters returning from the first film, they changed actors for the flashback/prequel story of the narrative, Robert De Niro takes over the role of Vito Corleone and I want to say that he does the character justice but it's almost impossible to stop thinking of the magnificent and perfect performance that Marlon Brando did as the older Vito. Some important characters are Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone, Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Michael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli, G. D. Spradlin as Senator Pat Geary, Richard Bright as Al Neri, Gastone Moschin as Fanucci and Tom Rosqui as Rocco Lampone. There's of course much more actors and fully fleshed out characters. Hyman Roth is a Jewish mobster, investor and a business partner of Vito Corleone, and later his son Michael Corleone. He is based on New York mobster Meyer Lansky. Frank Pentangeli is a caporegime in the Corleone family, running the family's operations in New York City while Michael Corleone, his brother and underboss, Fredo and the other two capos, Rocco Lampone and Al Neri are based in Nevada.The character arc for Michael Corleone in the first two parts of The Godfather Trilogy is brilliant and just a milestone in terms of storytelling, but it comes full circle here and sees the true nature of Michael. I just think he's a brilliant character and even though he's such an ice cold person and evil person, I still sympathize with him because of who he once was and who he still is underneath it all. The Godfather Part III is a satisfying end to his arc and it wouldn't be as excellent if it wouldn't be for this movie.Rewatching this film made me appreciate it even more and I can finally say that this is among the best films I've ever seen. Like Goodfellas, this trilogy is worth coming back to again and again, I just hope it doesn't take me years to rewatch it again. In terms of camera, lighting, cinematography, composition, production design, costume, storytelling, writing and acting. It's flawless and a master class in filmmaking. With all that said, I just have to admit this, I think the story was better in the first film and that's mostly because of how the entire film was based on the book, whilst Part II is partially based on that book (it's only Vito's backstory that's based on the novel, rest is original). On my first viewing, my thoughts were the opposite, I thought the story was better here but the first has a better story but I think this film has improved on everything.The Godfather Part II is a masterpiece that I'll continue to study and to enjoy, almost 50 years and it's holding up better than some of the latest in the past two decades, I think letting Francis Ford Coppola get complete freedom with the follow-up to The Godfather was the right choice for the studio and for the trilogy. It wouldn't have been as good if that weren't the case, but we got an masterpiece and a classic out of it."
jansen-aui,"Jun 26, 2006",10/10,"Given complete control over the directorial proceedings by Paramount, and a much larger budget to boot, you would be forgiven to think Francis Ford Coppola had it good when, two years after the release of The Godfather, the studio convinced him to direct The Godfather: Part II. Despite this free reign, Coppola still faced challenges  most important being the daunting task of matching the first picture, creatively and financially. There are many critics who regard the second part of the Corleone saga as not only equal, but superior than the first, and while I don't think Part II is as ""classic"" as it's original, I can concede without hesitation that this is the more ambitious and grand in scope, and certainly more powerful as an exercise in tragedy.The Godfather: Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), established in the end of part one as the new Don of the Corleone crime family, who has moved all their interests out to Nevada. Michael looks to expand his empire and invest in businesses in Havana and Miami, where Hyman Roth (one of his father's aging ex-partners) resides. When betrayal comes from where he least expects, Michael must make decisions and sacrifices, however difficult, to save his family, and in doing so will perpetually change who he is as a person. Throughout Michael's ordeal, Coppola flashes back to the turn of the century, where a young Vito Corleone (then Vito Andolini) must flee Sicily when he becomes hunted by the local Mafioso at the age of only nine. As an immigrant, we are shown the rise of Vito (Robert De Niro from young adulthood onwards) as a man of respect, loyalty, enormous generosity and ever growing authority on the streets of New York.Coppola must be given due for the transitions between the two parallel story lines, which are absolutely seamless. They come at natural breaks so as to not take away from the pacing of either narrative, and the episodic approach to covering thirty-odd years in the young Vito storyline is perfect for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for the developments in the Michael story. With the interconnectedness of the narrative, Coppola encourages a contrast of the way Michael and Vito take control of their respective families  what decisions they make, what they value  and this helps to further punctuate and underline the film's harrowing final scenes.In keeping with the tone of the first picture, Part II sees the return of Gordon Willis' dark, under lit photography, and Nino Rota's memorable, distinctive score (largely utilising the same cues as the first, with the addition of a few new themes including the magnificent ""The Immigrant""). The acting across the board is quality  just as it was in the original. John Cazale has a larger role here as Fredo, whose outburst at being stepped over as the family Don is as forceful and potent as any in his regrettably short career. Newcomers to the picture give excellent supporting turns, Michael Gazzo as caporegime Frank Pentangeli and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, preserving Brando's famous gesture and manner, but it's Al Pacino's picture through and through  his Michael is so intense, but yet is an empty shadow of his former self. By the end of the picture, Pacino's beady black eyes are cold: completely stripped of life, and reflect upon the tragedy of the loss of the family he committed all his power to trying to protect. It's a haunting, powerful, parting frame that lasts."
harry_smyth,"Aug 23, 2005",10/10,"In my opinion this is the finest of the crime genre ever made. It is thoroughly compelling from start to finish and the fastest three hours i can remember spending. Every aspect of the film is virtually flawless; plot, cinematography and in particular the acting. Pacino and De Niro are amazing in their respective roles and one can only look on in awe at the levels of believability in the characters that they attain. Although i would not consider De Niro's performance to be the greatest of his career as i think he achieved even more in his portrayals of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and Jake La Motta in Raging Bull; for me this is Pacino at his best. The camera work in the flashback sequences chronicling the early life of Vito is stunning and would make you think you are looking at a picture from the twenties. There is obviously a lot of debate as to which is the better film, this or its predecessor, but i consider this to be superior as it holds the viewers attention more. An absolute Classic. 10/10"
jaceydoe-2,"Jul 13, 2001",N/A,"By the end of this classic sequel to ""The Godfather"", I absolutely felt nothing but hatred for Michael Chorleone.  Even though he waited until his mother faded off to kill Fredo, I still couldn't feel anything for Mike. But when you see the last shot of the film, you realize that he is going to regret it for as long as he lives and will fall into a deep depression for the next decade or so.  How could he be so mad at Fredo for being tricked by those two rats, Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola. That wasn't exactly all Fredo's fault. But, you not only do you feel the neglect from Michael to Fredo, but you feel the neglect from Michael to his family and household.  That was one of the really haunting parts of the film.  Michael's neglect is what causes him to fall into the deep depression by the end of the film and into the third installment of the trilogy.  Francis Ford Coppola has a true gift in film making and to this day remains one of the best directors in the business. The best of the trilogy.10/10 The best film ever made. *****/*****"
sunznc,"May 6, 2012",6/10,"As far as sequels go this isn't awful. A lot of money went into this and the acting is excellent by everyone.The sparkle and grit and realism that appears in almost every frame of The Godfather just isn't here. Some of this seemed forced and contrived and overall the story is quite grim and depressing. Even in The Godfather there were a few scenes here and there that were light and slightly amusing. You get none of that here. Everything here is black.I also think that this a little bit too long. I think it could have moved faster.All in all it isn't something I would watch a second time. Not like the original, which is a product of it's time."
ferguson-6,"Apr 20, 2012",10/10,"Six weeks ago was The Godfather in a theatre setting. This time it was the sequel, which generated an equal amount of movie bliss. Experiencing these two classic movies on the big screen almost 40 years after release reinforces what great films they are  and how few truly great films get made. We are reminded that a powerful well-written story, world class cast, visionary director, brilliant photographer and stunning composer are all necessary components for movie greatness.This sequel explores three time periods: the journey of 9 year old Vito to the U.S., his rise to power in Little Italy, and Corleone life after Vito's death. Some find the cuts to varying timelines to be distracting. Personally, I find it fascinating and a very effective way to tell the entire story. Watching an almost mute 9 year old Vito land on Ellis Island and transform into a twenty-something community ""leader"" is one of the more powerful and unlikely events ever seen on screen. Mix that with Al Pacino holding little back as a power-mongering Michael is downright frightening. If you doubt this, look at it from the perspective of Diane Keaton's May, or John Cazale's Fredo.The film received 11 Oscar nominations and won 6, including Best Picture. Robert DeNiro won for his tremendous turn as young Vito. This is early DeNiro  the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver era. DeNiro and Marlon Brando remain the only two actors to have won Oscars for playing the same character. Two other acting nominations went to Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V Gazzo as Pentangeli. Mr. Strasberg was the famed acting teacher whose prized pupils included none other than Al Pacino (who talked him into taking this role). Strasberg was also bequeathed 75% of the Marilyn Monroe estate and there was much scandal after his death when his widow auctioned off most of it.A couple of other interesting points were that most of this script was original for the film, though the background story of Vito was drawn from Mario Puzo's novel. Director Francis Ford Coppola considered casting Joe Pesci as the young Clemenza, but ultimately decided on Bruno Kirby. Dominic Chianese plays Hyman Roth's right hand man Johnny Ola. Chianese has been recently seen in both The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. B-Movie mogul Roger Corman plays one of the Senators on the committee interrogating Michael and Pentangeli. Harry Dean Stanton plays one of the FBI bodyguards, and former heartthrob Troy Donahue plays Connie's (Talia Shire) goofy boyfriend Merle. One of my favorite characters in the film is Don Fanucci, robustly played by Gastone Moschin. His strutting and preening always creeps me out and makes me laugh.Besides being the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar, The Godfather II is simply one of the finest films ever made. At 200 minutes, it requires both a time and mental commitment, but along with The Godfather, Coppola and Puzo have provided us exemplary story telling through expert filmmaking."
cinephile-27690,"Jul 31, 2018",10/10,"After realizing I have just reviewed the first movie, I realized I should do the 2nd!Out of Coppola's work that I have seen thus far, this is my favorite. This is quite ironic because upon my 1st viewing, I thought it was the weakest of the trilogy.It may seem insane to rate this above the first, but Richard Roeper calls this his favorite movie.(See IMDB's trivia page for him.)Now WHY do I like this above the other? Hmmm..I have a hard time explaining that. I think one thing is the quotes. ""My offer to you is this...nothing."" ""My Dad said you would always catch a fish if you said a Hail Mary.""(that's a paraphrase.)
If I had to criticize something, it would be its length. Roger Ebert said ""no good movie is too long and no bad movie is too short."" I disagree with the first half.TGP2 is very good but it's also very long. At 202 minutes, the movie actually seem longer and I had to repeatedly stop the DVD to get through it. Luckily there is an intermission you can skip.Either way, I do think this is the best Coppola film and therefore-if you see the 1st movie before this, you will definitely thoroughly enjoy it!"
yagizefetunc,"Jan 19, 2025",10/10,"The Godfather II further deepens the legacy of the first film, expanding not only its story but also its character depth and thematic structure perfectly. This production once again demonstrates the artistic power of cinema and offers an impressive viewing experience in every respect.Every scene, every dialogue in the film carries great meaning. Coppola draws the audience into the scenes by using cinema as theater. Al Pacino's performance is truly extraordinary; Michael Corleone, whom we once knew as a pure, innocent man, gradually becomes a cruel leader. We can feel this transformation in the coldness in Pacino's eyes and the lines on his face. And of course, Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone character from the first film continues to remain in the shadows in this film. Vito's untimely disappearance deepens the themes in the film even more.The film tells itself with the intertwining of two parallel stories. On the one hand, a flashback is given to Vito Corleone's youth, his roots in Italy and how he founded his family, while on the other hand, Michael Corleone's increasingly corrupt journey in the world of crime, endangering his family, is followed. While Michael initially acts in the name of honesty and justice, over time he surrenders to the same forces and the same corrupt morality. This transformation is almost a tragedy. Just like watching a character's internal conflicts change from beginning to end in a theater, this evolution that Michael goes through deeply grips the viewer.As a result, The Godfather Part II is not just a crime film, but a drama that tells the dark sides of human nature, moral collapse and the forces that shape a person's destiny.Watching The Godfather Part II is not just a movie experience, it is like getting lost in a work of art. The film offers a perfect narrative both independently of the previous production and on its own. It has a unique place in the world of cinema both thematically and in terms of character depth. This film is an example of how a sequel can be even greater and is at the top of the list of places where cinema can reach its peak.In this sense, The Godfather Part II is a true cinematic masterpiece."
lifelinespublishing,"Feb 16, 2019",10/10,"I will just write a short review of this because all of the points were said on the reviews on this but I have always marveled at how great all the actors were in this film, Al Pacino had that certain charm,gentleness and yet ruthlessness in him in carrying out all the things he had to do, John Cazale as Fredo is a perfect role, sad that man died with so much acting left in him., Duvall, Talia Shire, De Niro and Diane Keaton also played their part perfectly and with so much ease...Overall, a perfect film that teaches you about everything."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 5, 2023",10/10,"Do not let the title fool you. You can easily view this film without ever having seen Godfather I, and get even a better feel for the Corleone family than the first film. The addition of Robert De Niro as a young Marlon Brando in this one adds greatly to the intensity of The Godfather experience. In my opinion, De Niro has a much tougher persona than Brando, and the origin sequences therefore, are that much more dramatic. The cinematography is gorgeous, the music is top-notch, and the acting by the entire supporting cast to Al Pacino is superb. My favorite moments of the film were the De Niro sequences, and especially the entry into New York harbor. You can easily see the first Godfather and watch this film at a later date without missing a beat to the extended story, or you can actually see this one by itself; it is a stand-alone masterpiece.PS. On IMDB, this film is rated below The Dark Knight. LOL. It would appear too many children are voting and not enough adults are participating in the poll. This is like letting children vote in general elections (which might not be a bad idea at some point). Maybe having an age restriction for voting might help a bit, or having a different section for children under 18."
MaxBorg89,"Mar 15, 2006",10/10,"After the huge success of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo go on with narrating the history of the Corleone family. It picks up right where we left it: Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has replaced his deceased father as head of the family, becoming one of the most powerful criminals in America. Soon enough, however, he will realize absolute power also means absolute solitude. Apart from his henchmen and his lawyer (Robert Duvall) he can't trust anyone (""Keeps your friends close, but your enemies closer""), including his own brother Fredo (John Cazale). Hell, even his wife (Diane Keaton) doesn't feel safe next to him anymore.As we witness Michael's dealings with power, corruption and murder, we're also given the chance to see what gave birth to the Corleone dynasty in the first place. We learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named Vito Andolini had to escape from his native Sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. Once at Ellis Island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. From that day on, he would be known as Vito Corleone. Yes, it's the same Vito Corleone who made ""offers you can't refuse"" in the first movie, and this time we're shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. It's a riveting look at yesterday's society, which doesn't differ that much from ours: power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated man's methods can get, violence is still the ""best"" way to achieve something under specific circumstances.Just like Part I, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame. The screenplay is flawless, Coppola and Puzo seamlessly moving back and forth in time to show us the origin and fate of the most beloved cinematic family that's ever shown up on a screen.The family theme emerges off-screen as well, as the director's father, Carmine Coppola, helps Nino Rota with the superb, tragic score.But let's not forget the extraordinary actors who made each member of the Corleones memorable: Pacino steals the show with his best performance alongside Scarface's Tony Montana, while Duvall, Cazale and Talia Shire (not to mention James Caan in a priceless flashback cameo) display the same charisma they had in the previous installment. Yet there's one guy who tops all of them, the only one I haven't mentioned so far: Robert De Niro, who won his first Oscar for playing the young Vito Corleone. It's one of those rare times people don't complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so Marlon Brando wouldn't have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect): De Niro's star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older Don for the entire movie. It's a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks Sicilian throughout the film), which would become De Niro's trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway made their appearance.Before The Godfather: Part II was released, all sequels were considered B-movies. I can see why opinions changed after this film: watch it back-to-back with its predecessor and you'll feel rewarded for giving that awesome twosome part of your time."
Hassard1994,"Jul 9, 2008",N/A,"I remember saying in my review of ""The Godfather"" that i was going to review this film a week later, that was more than one week ago that's for sure. I did actually start watching ""The Godfather Part II"" the next Friday, though i stopped watching after an hour because i wasn't really in the mood for it! So i decided that today, with nothing else to do, i'd give it another try and i wasn't disappointed! It was a great film, lots of talking but it's still great fun to watch.I only have one criticism, the length. It was extremely long, about 3 and a half hours! But that's my only criticism, everything else was spot on! Hopefully i'll be watching ""The Godfather Part III"" soon and as soon as i do, i'll post my opinion right here!So overall, ""The Godfather Part II"" is just as good as the original Godfather If you haven't seen this film yet, watch it now!9/10"
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Mar 5, 2024",7/10,"Unlike its predecessor, I found the lengthy three and a half hours runtime to be quite tiresome, as the storyline failed to grasp me in a same way it did on the previous occasion. Whilst there were some gripping moments, they were mostly reserved for the climactic portions, leaving the middle segment lacking in much-needed urgency and momentum.Furthermore, the constant jumps between the present and the past at regular intervals felt disjointed, causing the narrative to become convoluted. While I appreciate non-linear storytelling, in this case, I feel, it could have benefited from some fine-tuning.And last but not the least, I couldn't help but miss the presence of Mr. Brando. No disrespect to De Niro, who is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of our time, but the role of Vito Corleone was so deftly embodied by Marlon Brando that I couldn't envision anybody else in his place. While I understood the need to portray a younger version of the character, I still wish Mr. Brando have had some part to play."
Helg88,"Jun 7, 2007",2/10,"I managed to tolerate the first but this one was an insult! I am not faulting the acting, just the film in general. It expects viewers to understand about the Mafia, and want to watch as these mundane characters speak in a secret coded language in Italian. I have forced myself through this film and would think it a cruel personal punishment to force myself to consider watching the third one. There must be other people out there who dislike this film as I do...? When comparing this film to others of a similar time (or before) I can still not understand its appeal. I can not believe any of this trilogy can make it into the top ten, let alone be people's favourite film!"
NikkoFranco,"May 25, 2018",10/10,"The Godfather Parts 1 and 2 is something that every self-respecting cinebuff must see, whether once , or again and again, there is no shame in admitting that something as beautiful book story from Mario Puzo reaches a wider audience through the silver screen.As it is told in parts how Don Corleone escaped the claws of vengeance as a young child in Italy ( the young adult played seamlessly by Robert de Niro) and ending up in Staten Island without a word of English after being rescued by good samaritans, to the memories of his mother being assassinated right before his eyes, then intermittent change of scenes with Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino) in the present day who already took the mafia helm from his father Don Corleone.Betrayal by your own kin, plotting for revenge at every opportunity, slowly and wyly eradicating all enemies, this film is THE film no CGI or modern tech can remake nor surpass. Superb acting by the cast and the haunting music that became known as the Godfather's theme. It is just marvelous."
mjneu59,"Nov 22, 2010",10/10,"It's rare for a sequel to match its predecessor, but the follow-up to Francis Ford Coppola's monumental mob family drama does more than simply continue the same story, expanding on themes only suggested in Part One to present an ambitious overview of organized crime in 20th century America. The Corleone family tree is divided here into parallel histories, with young Vito (Robert De Niro) arriving in the New World to begin a family, and a family empire, which a generation later his bitter and lonely son Michael (Al Pacino) would consolidate, destroying in the process everything he holds dear. The sudden displays of gangland violence are no longer placed in ironic juxtaposition to the unlikely richness of Corleone family values, being used instead to measure the corruption of il padrone's immigrant idealism: murder to young Vito is strictly a matter of honor, but to Michael it's only an extension of his absolute power. The crosscutting between two stories sacrifices a consistent narrative flow in favor of complexity and depth, but it's a fair trade, and seen together with Part One (Part Two should not be seen without the introduction provided by the earlier film) is a rich experience not soon forgotten."
Coxer99,"Mar 21, 1999",10/10,"I have to agree with Robert Towne when he said this film is one of the greatest achievements in the history of screenwriting. When the camera follows DeNiro as he moves from rooftop to rooftop, falling into the abyss filled with crime and corrpution, it will affect him and his family forever. DeNiro is slick and smooth as the young Vito Corleone. The rise of Michael Corleone's power is superbly captured by Coppola and delivered with cold hearted villainy by Al Pacino, in his finest performance. Strasberg is also solid in his performance of Hyman Roth. It's nice to see him put that ""method"" to work. The only one who feels out of it here is Duvall who seems to be simply going through motions. It may have been that Tom's character is also given limited depth within the script. It is a superb sequel, argued by many to be superior to the original."
Hitchcoc,"Feb 16, 2007",10/10,"It's only a sequel because of the Part II thing. This simply fills in the spaces with one of the greatest characters of all time. Remember, the two were put together in an incredible sage, putting things in chronological order. Talk about your psychological studies. Inside the head of Michael Corleone is a sense of power at all costs. Yet, he sees himself as a moral man. I wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. They have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. They fear and react to threats from the outside, from ""non-family"" members.The product they sell is terror. Of course, all participants live on the edge. Their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. Brothers kill brothers.I haven't a lot to add because I am not a film expert. As uncomfortable as this film makes me (like the first one), I continue to watch. And in my heart of hearts I wonder if I were cast into this setting, could I stand up to the expectations of my culture?"

AdamSixties,"Aug 10, 2007",5/10,"Godfather Part 2 is so hailed as the greatest film of all time it's time someone burst that overblown bubble and I've got the needle right here. So let's take a closer look at what should be considered a mediocre sequel to the classic film, The Godfather. First of all Marlon Brando is nowhere to be seen here. Instead we get random flashbacks to Robert Deniro as the young Vito. We get some good scenes of old Little Italy though there's a Keystone-cops feel to some of it, especially the comic relief of the slumlord scene.Part 2 has a much bigger budget but a script with weakened plot lines and dialogue, basically trying to followup everything from Part 1 logically becoming formulaic and soap-operaish, and ending up falling flat.The film begins with another celebration of some kind. A brother's betrayal aspires to be that of Hamlet, but without the depth or wit (or brevity). It's now the 1950s and Mike is in Nevada and is trying to buy a corrupt Senator. The Senator is I suppose the film producer element of the first, but with nothing creative like a horse head...just crass dialogue that doesn't ring true. We also get a Mafia hearing in Congress which should have ended up on the cutting room floor. We also get (the great?) Lee Strasberg as some old shirtless and feeble mobster. He may be a great teacher, but someone tell me why this is an Academy Award winning acting performance! Am I just dumb? Al Pacino is great as always, this performance following Serpico, but his dialogue doesn't ring true. When he begins, ""If history has taught us anything.."" I expect some deep wisdom to follow...needless to say it doesn't. Talia Shire's character is also weakened compared to the original's Connie. Here she just ""needs money"" and wants Mike to forgive Fredo because ""he's so sweet"". This mess of a sequel ends with a literal bloodbath, but following the formula of the first, and a final scene with the original cast (sans Brando) the actors of which were paid more than all their good work in the original. I'm not saying it isn't worth seeing, just that it's inferior to the original in many ways. But of course it isn't near as bad as Part 3. My final criticism is that all these mob films intentionally or not glorify criminals. Okay, now you can click ""no""."
Thanos_Alfie,"Aug 11, 2013",9/10,"Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of ""The Godfather"" the ""The Godfather: Part II"". ""The Godfather: Part II"" is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba.In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.""The Godfather: Part II"" is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title ""Touching perfection..."", but it continues to be the best sequel of all times."
kenjha,"Dec 27, 2008",10/10,"This, perhaps the greatest sequel ever, tells the parallel stories of Michael's struggles as the new Godfather and the rise of the legendary Vito Corleone. The presentation of Vito's story is particularly impressive, with DeNiro in a fine performance. Michael's story tends to bog down at times but never fails to be compelling. Pacino is terrific, as are Duvall, Cazale, and Strasberg. The cinematography is beautiful and Rota builds on his memorable score from the first film. Coppola pushes all the right buttons, letting the stories unfold majestically. Having made the two Godfather films by age 35, the talented director had nowhere to go but down."
C22Man,"Oct 29, 2013",10/10,"It seems impossible to think that the first Godfather could be topped, but its direct sequel may be even better. It effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. The plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before.The plot is split in two, one following the Corleone family in modern day and the other early life of Vito. The first follows Michael who is now Don as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas. He faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from Capo Frank Pentangeli and his own sister. He later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. This story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. The second charts the young life of Vito Corleone as he raises his family in New York and aims to build his own legacy. This sees him challenge the local Don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. This part gives us a true insight into how all of what we're seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events.The huge cast is once again truly outstanding. Al Pacino gives an incredible performance as we see Michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. The way Pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. The other star is John Cazale as Fredo, he is outstanding as the timid Fredo, the chemistry between himself and Pacino sets their scenes alight. Robert Duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved Tom, while Diane Keaton is great showing Kay as confused and frightened of her situation. Michael V. Gazzo is superb as Frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. Richard Bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal Al Neri. Joe Spinell is great as the doubtful Cicci as is Lee Strasberg as the devious Hyman Roth. Robert De Niro made his name here, he plays Vito with assured comfort and is just as good as Brando, which is praise itself.The film looks stunning. It is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. The scenes of early New York and of Sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. The music from Nino Rota is once again marvellous. The script is full of classic lines, ""Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer"" and ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies"" to name but two. It's great how the film focuses more on Michael and it's reflected by the look at Vito. Michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. We see the differences in how the family is set. Vito's was built on loyalty and love, whereas Michael's family is built on fear and violence. It is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then it's tragic fall. There are so many classic scenes, Michael finding out the traitor, Kay's pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with Fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous 'fishing trip' to name a few. The final shot of Michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time.The Godfather Part II is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen."
utgard14,"Jul 15, 2014",10/10,"Phenomenal sequel to The Godfather is split between two stories. One follows the events of the first movie as Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) deals with strife inside and outside the family as he works to expand the business. The other tells the story of a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) and his rise to power.The greatest sequel of all time? Yeah I can't see many doubts about that. It's often said to be even better than the first movie. I don't see the point in splitting hairs over it. I'll just say that I love both films a lot, though I rewatch the first one more often than this one. For the optimum experience you should watch both movies back-to-back like they're one long film. As with the first movie, this is pretty much flawless. I can't think of a thing about it I would change."
FilmOtaku,"Apr 8, 2004",8/10,"An excellent follow up to the original, The Godfather Part II continues where the first film left off and explores the rise of Vito Corleone in a series of flashbacks that, for the most part, correlate with what is presently happening to Michael Corleone (Pacino) his son and successor. This is a beautifully produced piece of film, and while I still prefer the first installment, simply because of the story content, it is every bit as good.  This film is best when watched together with the first film  if your body can stand it.  Even better, watch the third one as well for a little closure and so you can argue over whether it's a good film or not.  (I myself personally like the third film, but not as much as the first two.)--Shelly"
jamesbutterford,"Oct 28, 2010",10/10,"This is an excellent film. That's all there is to it. Personally, I think it's more than a little better than the first movie (excellent film also). In the DVD commentary, Coppola himself says that this is at least as good as the first film and that this is where he wanted to end things. The acting here is phenomenal from every character and I think the best performance is perhaps from the actor of Don Fanucci. You just don't see movies like this made anymore. I think the reason I prefer this over the first has a lot to do with the pacing. This movie is a little more fun and the flashback/forward structure always keeps things moving, as well as providing a beautiful contrast between the two generations of dons. By the way, don't let anybody tell you the stories have nothing to do with each other. Its structure is what really makes this a memorable movie, and it actually works without being tacky, unlike Once Upon a Time in America."
gonzoparkinson,"Dec 19, 2018",10/10,This is the greatest sequel ever made and in my opinion the finest film i have ever seen. I couldn't tell you how many time I have watched it.
Kirpianuscus,"Jul 29, 2019",N/A,"To define it as a masterpiece is easy, fair and silly. Because it is obvious - it is a masterpiece. But for each viewer, for specific reasons. Sure, the duel between Al Pacino and Robert de Niro is the key. For me, splendid is the job of John Cazale. The embroidery of the life of father and son, the metamorphose of Michael Corleone, the pressure of past, the air of nostalgia , the details as large mosaics and the cold feeling of a story about everything. A gangster movie ? Maybe not exactly. Because, at the each new view, it gives more than a story about Mafia. But universal history of mankind as a sort of parable."

EzioMonty117,"Oct 25, 2015",10/10,"I really enjoyed The Godfather, so i decided to see The Godfather Part 2 if it's better or worse, and to my utter surprise, it's better than the original and has one of the best performances in a Movie ever. This film is a true masterpiece. Here's why.The story is as good as the original, this time the film has two separate story lines: Vito Corleone as a Young man and Michael Corleone's storyline. Vito Corleone's story follows his life as he evacuates from New York and to Italy by his parents in 1910 and goes through his normal day life, and Michael Corleone's story follows him being accused for being a criminal by the Law after being framed by his Brother during a celebration when another criminal did the illegal Activity that happen in the celebration and Michael goes through Family life and has a divorce With his wife and all that stuff and must prove that he isn't guilty of the actions caused by a another person.The film's direction is one of the biggest strengths of this film, it's switch between Vito and Michael is done in a good pace and well choreographed camera transitions makes this film direction nearly a masterpiece. The performances especially once again Al Pacino is so good, it deserved an Oscar for best performance, for a reason, Pacino's character is so emotional, you really care for him in the scenes With his wife. Oustanding i must say.The film, despite being a serious drama, has some funny moments, like where one of the characters gives Vito Money and continuously regrets it, now that was funny, but the film really is quite serious apart from that one scene, that's why the change of pace makes this quite comforting of a Movie.The characters are better and the film is longer, The Godfather Part 2 is one of the best films i've ever seen, Performances, humor, drama, direction, Music and characters are great, there is nothing terrible With this Movie. Check this out10/10"
lesleyharris30,"Jul 27, 2013",9/10,"The Godfather: Part II is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. This sequel is just as good, and in some ways better, than the original. Unlike most sequels, it remembers why the first movie was so loved and goes back on that, without copying it.I do think it was overlong, running at almost three hours and a half. There is so much too it because it is telling two fully fledged stories, at times I did feel the separate plots could have been broken up in to two movies.The cast is absolutely marvelous, Al Pacino delivers one of the highlights of his career as we watch Michael Corleone become corrupt as he takes control of his father's empire. He is joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton.The main reason you would think this movie could not work out is because Marlon Brando could not be in it, but Robert De Niro manages to shine as a younger version of Vito Corleone, putting in an engrossing performance that is worthy to Brando's in every way, so much so that they are the only two actors to receive an Academy Award for portraying the same characters. Dramatic, intense and extremely well acted, The Godfather: Part II is a long journey, but it's worth every minute, I would recommend to all moviegoers.As Michael takes over his father's business, we learn the origins of Vito and his empire.Best Performance; Robert De Niro"
MyPetMongoose,"Jul 8, 1999",N/A,"I hate being the lone voice of searing ridicule in a throng of glowing adulation, but I must say that I found the Godfather: Part II to be dull, predictable and pointless.  The Godfather is a wonderful film with a compelling story arch of a good American war hero being pulled into the depths of organized crime due to his loyalty to family. While Part II makes an attempt to elaborate and deepen this theme it does very little to bring anything new to it.  Michael's loss of his family and the fate of his brother Fredo is obvious by the end of the first reel. Such a predictable plot undermines what would otherwise be an interesting sequel to a great film. Only the flashback scenes with Robert DeNiro as a young Vito Corleone has any of the emotion and energy of the original Godfather.  If only the rest of the film was written and directed with such flair. I was so disappointed by The Godfather:  Part II that I haven't even bothered to see Part III and I have little interest in Coppola's other work to this day."
in1984,"Mar 1, 2013",3/10,"If you must see a Godfather film, see the 1st. Like #2, it's overrated and over-hyped, bot not nearly as much. Both are long films in need of more cuts, but 2 is like a film by a man who can't stop talking about himself and his friends.The massive failing is the director gets far too much respect, as if he's a mafia godfather himself, so not nearly enough cuts are made, like Diane Keaton's awful acting. While it's easy enough to follow the 2 timelines, it's disappointing that because of the sloppy excesses of the main timeline, the 2 rarely tie together. Had it been up to me, I would have done only the early timeline as a prequel.Pacino and DeNiro both deserve the acting credit they get. The whole film is filled with interesting, well acted male characters - probably what deceives many people into giving it excess credit. Unfortunately, great acting performances and characters don't add up to a masterpiece."
RM851222,"Jan 10, 2023",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Godfather Part II"" (1974) is a great sequel to arguably the best movie of all time - and that is saying something. In my personal opinion and for my taste i do prefer first film over Part 2 by a mile, but that is another story. When it comes to Part 2 i do not think that its story and storytelling is as tight as in Part 1, because there are some subplots involving Michael's life which i do not really find that interesting or involving. But when it comes to Vito's part, its a movie to behold.Overall, ""The Godfather Part II"" is a great movie - no surprises here. I do prefer first one over part 2 way more - sometimes less is better. But this is a great movie by all accounts."
LeonLouisRicci,"Jul 7, 2013",10/10,"You must have heard the raves...""the best Sequel of all time"", well, Star Wars Fans may disagree but it is a valid argument. This surpasses a Great Film with an even greater Film. It is certainly broader in Scope and even more lavish in its Production. The Flashback New York Scenes are a standout.The warm, rich Cinematography remain and the sharp Characters with a wider palette to add even more richness to proceedings. It is more edgy and is less likely to linger with Portrait like introductions to already known participants. There are more interesting themes here like the expansion to Las Vegas, and the formation of the Family's Patriarch and sensibilities, and the Senate Hearings.This one moves quite a bit faster than the original because it has much more to say. It says it and then some. Michael's descent into internal Madness is not a pretty sight and the Inheritor to all that is Corleone becomes a very unlikable Tyrant and shows virtually no signs of Humanity as the Modernity of events that take place have no place for that sort of thing."
bobsgrock,"Nov 19, 2009",9/10,"The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michael's reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.All this aside, I haven't even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity."
michael_the_nermal,"Jul 16, 2007",9/10,"Warning! Spoilers Ahead!""The Godfather, Part II"" is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movie's strengths lie in Copolla's retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn't differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.Pacino's Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous ""scream"" to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute he's calm, the next he's in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keaton's performance is usually cited as the weakest of the ""Godfather"" saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinema's most memorable characters. One minute he's a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian ""tarantella""; the next he's viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michael's control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played ""The Turk"" Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasberg's Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the film's main antagonist. Roth's true evil is only revealed in other characters' dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasn't fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don't actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous ""This is the Business We've Chosen"" speech he gives to Michael.Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We don't see much of Fredo in Part I, but he's essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naiveté, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roth's scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that ""there was something in it for me!"", but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo's ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a ""Hail Mary,"" right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the ""family business.""Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael ""loses his family,"" in terms of his wife's abortion and departure, and Fredo's treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michael's mother tells him ""you will never lose your family.""This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copolla's further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copolla's career: ""what do you mean 'Charlie don't surf?!'"") He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie."
aggaurav67,"Oct 13, 2008",10/10,"If the Godfather is a masterpiece then this is a ""grand-masterpiece"". How often do you see a work of perfection in movies? After watching this movie,you can (at least) answer ""once"". The movie is the sequel and prequel to The Godfather as you all must know and shows the rise of Vito and Michael Corleone in two separate story lines. In this movie we see the rise of Vito Corleone to become The Godfather and how Michael Corleone expands his family business but we also see his moral degradation.In the Godfather we see Vito Corleone has no regrets for his deeds because he had maintained his virtues but in this movie Michael regrets his deeds very much because he has morally degraded(which we see at the end).This is a fair depiction of ""changing times"". If you want to see a movie that leaves you with doubts about right and wrong ,justice and injustice ,hero and villain ;do watch this movie."
secondtake,"May 6, 2011",9/10,"The Godfather Part II (1974)Is this well made? Dramatic? Epic? Beautiful? Impressive?Of course.Is this better than the original Godfather? In some ways, yes. It lacks the originality of the whole world novelist Mario Puzo (and co-screenwriter Coppola) created, but it fills in background in Italy and adds wonderful new elements about immigration and the revolution in Cuba. It lacks Marlon Brando, who is a force of his own, but the presence of Robert DeNiro in the many long flashbacks is moving (and he has more presence than Pacino, frankly, who is intentionally stoic, but to the point of expressionless).Is it a great movie? Why not? What is a great movie supposed to do that this one doesn't? Well, for one thing, I don't think it surprises at all. It doesn't reveal anything too deeply, despite all its deeply felt and emotionally turbulent scenes, and despite the apparent inner probing of the main character (who is last seen thinking very hard, staring into space). It doesn't suggest how to feel about any of this violence, this cold duplicity.And maybe it shouldn't do any of these things. It is an oddly ""confirming"" experience. It shows what we have come to think we already know, more or less, about the mafia world with its combination of loyalty and bloody revenge, its attachment to business and its selfishness, its emphasis on family even as it kills those in its own family.What Coppola does do, as director, is suck you in. You get wrapped up in the world of these men (mostly men, of course, though with a great small role by Talia Shire and a famously troubled larger role by Diane Keaton, who makes a better Annie Hall by far). You are easily and gladly transported from New York to Las Vegas to Miami to Italy back and forth, across time and space, in warm colors and sweeping scenes, inside and out. The pieces of this rather complex story are put together with ""artful"" deliberation--it's a work of art, surely, despite its relatively straight forward intentions.It is also filmed, that is lit and photographed, with sensitivity, without becoming virtuosic for its own sake, by Gordon Willis. Part of the immersion happens because of how everything is depicted, and it's easier said than done to make it all cohere and remain beautiful.So yes, it's surely a terrific movie. It might not be one of your favorite movies, and it really isn't one of mine. I've resisted watching it a second time for two decades, and finally have, and found my mind wandering sometimes. This might partly be a testament to the imprint the Godfather movies have made on American culture and on the movies, because part of my distraction was that it's all so familiar. But it's familiar partly because it's so influential and convincing.But it's also partly true that there isn't a huge range of events here. I mean, a lot happens, but it falls mostly into a small diversity of power plays, deceptions, waiting games, and ruthless murders. It's all fascinating and terrifying on some level, but it all wraps around itself over and over again. You will find yourself understanding and even identifying with some of the characters, but you might not find yourself sympathizing with any of them, not the major ones, who are all (all) out for themselves in the end, or a pathetic followers yes men. In short, if you like this world and are fascinated by the male power aura, every second is filled with drama. But if like me this isn't really sufficient for over three hours of absorption, your mind might wander a bit, too.Cosi sia."
shoolaroon,"Aug 15, 2002",N/A,"someone made the comment that he didn't understand why the flashbacks to don corleone's rise to power (with de niro as don vito) were included, that it romanticized the Mob.  i think the reason that we have the 2 stories is that they parallel each other.  while we are seeing how michael corleone is developing as a mob boss and as a man, and what forces are shaping him, we also see the same things in his father's early life - how don vito reacted to events, how he made plans and how he became the man he was.  although both men lived a life of crime the difference in the two is striking and real - don vito worked his way out of poverty and immigration and tried to help his fellow italians in a way that seemed to work for him.  don vito never lost his sense of caring for people in general and that they depended on him.he never lost his love for his family.  he never lost the common touch, the things that would endear a man to a community and win their loyalty.  when we look at michael in his criminal growth we see he becomes a completely different man - cold, ruthless, uncaring and increasingly isolated both from his family and from the greater community.  don vito actually served, however wrongfully, a purpose in his community and did some good - he provided political and financial assistance, and a basic justice to many people who would have been denied it otherwise.  michael corleone however is just a nasty, vicious, unfeeling, opportunist who does not have the same human touch his father did. and i think that is the main revelation of the 2 movies and why we have the flashbacks.  frankly i prefer the first movie, and the flashbacks in the 2nd movie - don vito was a better man."
eddiez61,"Mar 18, 2010",10/10,"I secretly read Mario Puzo's The Godfather in 1974 when I was 12 after my mother prohibited me from seeing the movie. She was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. There sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. Vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. Consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. Historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. I was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. So this is what ""literature"" is all about. This is what ""reading"", I now understood, could be. I had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on I was a converted disciple of the Great American Fable. The story was truly great and I never could have imagined a better one until I finally saw the movies.Astoundingly, Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. The casting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. Where in the novel, Michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, Coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of Pacino's diminutive stature. Though we are told Michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother Sonny. Pacino's bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the Family Enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic.The other notable improvement on the book, of course is Marlon Brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. There wasn't then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. Don Vito Corleone's function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. He is the living embodiment of the ageless value of Heritage. Heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested.But since Godfather II begins after the Don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. So, Gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of Vito's tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century Sicily. Later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in New York City played by a sublimely low key Robert DeNiro. Oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. Rather, we are casually informed of Vito's entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. He is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal New World, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community.The period from which we are ""flashing"" is the late 1950s and early 1960s. By butting the ""old"" up against the ""new"" we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. This dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. By way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. It's a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, I believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. Consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, American life had so radically changed. Now consider how much things have changed since then.While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of ""Easy Rider."" Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I & II, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again.So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. It's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of America's true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo."
caesarr-13159,"Aug 17, 2021",10/10,"This might be the greatest sequel off all time, everyone involved behind the scenes did a completely amazing job."
bluedeluca,"Nov 9, 2003",10/10,"Citizen Cane, Casablanca, Lawerence Of Arabia and The Godfather are the American classics that usually vie for top film honors on all time great lists. Well, I can't argue those choices, but I can argue for the inclusion of, in my humble opinion, the greatest American film ever made, The Godfather Part II.I truly believe that Coppola topped himself with his second installment of the operatic crime drama. The parallel story structure was expertly crafted, with the rise of Michael story line soaring to Shakespearean heights. The acting, editing, cinematogragphy and writing are so tight that I can't pick a single flaw, a single moment that doesn't work or isn't pitch perfect. One thing I will concede is that for some, the story might unfold a touch slower than The GodFather and of course James Caan and Marlon Brando are only in it for a couple of scenes at the end. The major acting assignments in Godfather II fall solely in the hands of two film icons, Robert Deniro and Al Pacino both are unbelievable, both are at their best, especially Deniro who gives the audience no doubt that he will grow up to become the ""Don"" himself.Other notable performances are John Cazale and Lee Strasberg, actually every casting decision is note perfect, we believe everyones performance so much that they will forever be linked to those creations. I think the thing I love the most is the arc that Michael goes through, where he ends up at the end of Godfather II is so tragic and honest that the last shot of Pacino sitting, that look of pain, of loneliness of inexplicable loss, is engraved on my soul. Its a story of fathers and sons, we witness the connection of fates of choices and of lives over a century, its amazing. I know it is recognized but I think it should be regarded as a better film than the first one, by a slim margin but a margin nonetheless."
JoshuaMHetu,"Oct 24, 2019",10/10,"The first ""Godfather"" is one of my favorite movies. So is ""The Godfather Part II,"" which is not only superior to the original but has a serious claim to being my favorite movie of all time. While Marlon Brando's presence is sorely missed, ""Part II"" does everything the original did and does it better. Its story is deeper, richer, and ultimately more thought provoking. While ""Part I"" was a tale of good and evil, ""Part II"" explores the Mafia as the ultimate perversion of the American Dream - something that took the innocence of the immigrant ideal and warped it into a criminal monstrosity.""Part I"" showed how a good man can become evil. ""Part II"" continues that story and demonstrates how an amoral but complicated man can lose his own soul in doing what he thinks is right. Like ""Part I,"" ""Part II"" is endlessly entertaining but it's also more emotionally involving and satisfying. I love how the filmmakers show the parallel stories of Vito and Michael Corleone, who're both played brilliantly by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. The fact that Al Pacino didn't win the Oscar for ""Part II"" is unbelievable; it's easily the best performance of his career. In fact everyone in ""Part II"" is great, from Robert Duvall to Diane Keaton to John Cazale. Like ""Part I"" the writing, directing, and music of ""Part II"" are flawless and make for some of the greatest scenes in movie history. ""The Godfather Part II"" is an unqualified masterpiece and essential viewing for anyone who loves movies. 10/10."

ApenasSG,"May 8, 2025",7/10,"So, my opinion on The Godfather Part II might go against the general consensus, but I know I'm not alone - even back when it was released, some people felt the same: the film is confusing. At least from the beginning to the middle, I was completely lost. There are so many characters introduced without much focus, so you don't really get a chance to remember who's who. It felt like I had picked up a book and started reading it halfway through, you know?Surprisingly, the two timelines weren't the issue - that part was actually easy to follow. What really made it hard was keeping track of the events and understanding who the characters were. I kept forgetting what was happening or missing the subtler parts of the plot. That made the experience feel a bit disjointed for me.But then comes the final stretch of the movie... and that's where it really shines. Once the story narrows down and focuses on the main characters we already know, everything starts to make more sense. The movie becomes excellent. I loved all the nuances and parallels, especially between Vito, who always put family first, and Michael, who slowly distances himself from everyone. Michael is such a serious, cold, and calculated character - but the further you go, the clearer it becomes that he's fragile on the inside. He's always in control on the surface, but deep down, he's lost, breaking bonds and isolating himself.Maybe one day I'll rewatch it, knowing what to expect and appreciating the beginning more. But for now, my take is: yes, it's a confusing film at first, but the ending is amazing and really highlights the emotional weight and complexity of the characters."
leplatypus,"Jan 12, 2009",4/10,"This second part was projected after a short pause of 30 min. If the movie is the longest and I never felt it dull, it's the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion.The 60's trip into the Cuban revolution was too far away from the italo-American roots of the family. Maybe the drive of Michael Corleone to build his empire makes him too cold? But it was a pleasure to see Al playing with his mentor (Lee Strasberg) and watch their complicity.The great moment of this movie was the story of the Don played by De Niro. He speaks little but when he said something, you'd better listen. The life of immigrants in little Italia around 1900 was very well depicted. Except those flashbacks, it's really about the criminal life thus putting aside the family content which is the heart of those movies. Happily, there's a part III."
fwnujabes,"Apr 1, 2022",10/10,An actual masterpiece this is the best piece of cinema I've ever consumed nothing compares The Godfather is such a beautiful and dark piece of fiction this is a work of art.
MrskiViletic,"Nov 21, 2018",10/10,The second part of the Godfather trilogy manages something that seemed impossible - making a legitimate successor to one of the best movies ever. It is both a sequel and a prequel. Telling the stories of father Vito and son Micheal Corleone. The performances of DeNiro and Pacino are maybe the best of their impressive carriers.

Ricardodacosta-Stills,"Aug 3, 2021",10/10,IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .

FLC,"Oct 4, 1998",9/10,"The Godfather was a hard act to follow. It had an enthralling plot and the acting was second to none. So, when part two was released, you could be forgiven for being sceptical back in the seventies. But this film  was and still is pure class. With the death of Don Vito Corleone, Michael had to inherit the title, and he did it well. It covers everything you could think of and Robert De Niro is brilliance as the young Vito. Excellent."
dynaman,"Jan 19, 2005",5/10,"I had avoided watching this sequel for twenty years,fearful I would prefer it over the original. How wrong I was! Unlike most of the reviewers here who can't seem to gush effusively enough over this film, I feel it is a good distance behind the original. Here we have the overrated Al Pacino acting as if in a trance, stone-faced,humorless and cold-blooded, the epitome of egomania Nothing matters to him except crooked power and greed. A truly unsavory person.a rotten husband and father,he leaves little to admire,unlike his predecessor. Robert DeNiro gives another one of his elliptical performances. John Cazale as Fredo and Michael Gazzo as Freddie save the movie from being downright boring. What was the plot? Who cares?"
savannah-jackson,"Aug 6, 2009",10/10,the godfather part 2 is an absolutely flawless film you could even say it is better than the original the story is incredible and the makes sense the screenplay is amazing and realistic and the characters are perfect as well the acting from all the cast is just fantastic and i can't believe Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for his cold and amazing performance as Michael Corleone and Robert DeNiro is amazing in his role as young Vito John Cazale also delivers an incredible performance as Fredo Corleone the direction is amazing and Frances Ford Coppopla did an incredible job as a director the cinematography is incredible the score is amazing the godfather part 2 is one of the best films ever made and is one of the few that is completely perfect a log with the first godfather 10/10 an masterpiece

halilmloop,"Mar 4, 2022",10/10,The movie has everything you need. It shows what the mafia really does and why. It shows you the world on a different perspective. With the best actors of all time (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro). It shows the evolve of the characters Micheal and Vito a the best way. If you don't believe me look at the awards that the movie won. 6 Oscar's that is 1/4 of all the Oscars from that year.
julianbarker,"Mar 3, 2021",10/10,I've watched this movie at least a dozen times. The sequel is definitely the best out of The Godfather saga.
Cody2310,"May 25, 2008",10/10,"I cannot begin to explain the brilliance of this film. It is without a doubt my favorite film and arguably one of the greatest of all time.In my opinion, Al Pacino gives the best performance of his career, alongside Godfather Part I, Scarface, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Scent of a Woman. Pacino shows us the dark, ruthless and powerful side of Michael Corleone that was only shown for a brief time in the Godfather and delivers it to perfection. The loss of Marlon Brando has absolutely no effect on the film because he is still there in spirit and Pacino more than makes up for the absence.We are also given a glimpse of Vito Corleones early career as a Mafia figure. Robert DeNiro gives an amazing performance. Through this we are able to make the connection between Vito and Michael. We learn that Michael has, in fact, great reluctance compared to Vito in the process of living and accepting the Mafia way of life, although their motives are exactly the same: family.This film is more than good acting and plot, it is epic story telling at its best. Although very different in many ways from Godfather Part I, which chronicles family, Part II we realize the entire Godfather saga is more about the epic tragedy that is Michaels life rather than the Corleones.I have watched this film dozens and dozens of times and I never get bored. It is dramatic, suspenseful, emotional and clever. The script is phenomenal, the story is capturing and engaging and the acting is mind-blowing. If you have not seen this, or any of the Godfathers, WATCH THEM! (in order of course)Best ever. 10/10 would be an understatement for this film and for the Godfathers in general."
BSchin2188,"Jun 14, 2003",1/10,"The first Godfather is a very good movie.  Great acting, some action scenes to releive the slower parts, and a good musical score.  The only thing I can say in favor of this one is that it has good acting.  Other than that, I'd rather take a nap than watch this three hour bore-a-thon."
reggienunez,"Dec 19, 2019",9/10,"Often considered the greatest sequel ever made The Godfather 2 is an excellent film in its own right and an even better companion to the first Godfather. The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. The Godfather 2 is a masterpiece and should be a must watch for any serious cinema lover."
adeckofcards,"Jun 26, 2020",10/10,"Often when you think of the second parts you say that these are never good, but it was only to be expected that 'The Godfather Part II' was the exception.
How could you beat 'The Godfather', a practically perfect movie? It certainly wasn't an easy task, but Coppola knew how to do it.. Repeat the formula, but do it doubly better.
In this second film we see how Michael takes care of the family's criminal business as well as seeing the beginnings and youth of Vito Corleone. It is quite interesting how these two narratives contrast, both very intuitive, in the first one seeing how Michael destroys his family in his search for power, while Vito builds it. In this way Coppola makes the two apparently separate stories interconnected in a way that is both subtle and masterful.
But the real achievement of this second part may be as a slingshot in Michael and his criminal business, which in turn makes his humanity and family relationships compromised, giving the film a non-existent drama in the first part.
Finally the conclusion I draw from this film is that Francis Ford Coppola has achieved higher status as an artist by being able to not only match his first masterpiece, but to make it even better."
clouds88,"Dec 20, 2014",9/10,"As stated in my review of Godfather 1 , There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.The first scene of the movie, the traditional kissing of the hand of the Don, shows Michael taking over his father's place. Subsequent scenes show you that though he has taken over his father's seat, he is nothing like the old Don. The charismatic supremo is replaced by an angry, impatient man.The movie touches upon the life of immigrants to the new blooming world America wherein begins our former godfather's story. The story of young Vito Corleone runs parallel to the present day Don. The story of the great man is unfolded beautifully and entwined well with the present.In one scene, the relationship with present Don and his kid is intercepted by the young Vito Corleone, a young and handsome R. De Niro, playing with his little son, which enhances the contrast lifestyle of the two leading men.Attention to detail has been given the utmost importance and the scene in which the lead actor watches a play, which though irrelevant to the story is heart touching, is a proof for this.There are times when you just can't take your eyes off the well chiseled face of Robert De Niro and long for him to come back on screen.As the movie unfolds, we see how the Don junior tries hard to keep his personal life & business in place, something which the senior had done with ease. In one scene, the new don's anger at his wife for having aborted their to be boy child vis-à-vis the distress troubled look on old don's face while seeing his young son treated by a nurse shows the disparity in the way the two men handled their families.While Don Vito was as much a family man as he was a Godfather, his son, Michael fails to keep his family together. Like the icy cold winter snow, the relationship between the husband and wife is harsh and dry. True to his words, the ""Times were changing "".As the movie progresses, we see how the once well built, tightly held family by De Niro is slowly losing its strength and grip under his son.The love for his wife and kids in Niro's eyes in contrast to the anger in Michael's eyes for his wife underlines the entire movie.The story ends similar to the first movie, where all the Don's enemies are killed, whether they are part of family or not.Climax of movie sums up the life of Michael and the drastic changes over the years about his views and relationship he had with his father."
qg59,"Jul 21, 2006",10/10,"Everything about this movie is equal to the first one. In my opinion the only thing that makes the first one better is Marlon Brando. But this one is a close second. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, and Diane Keaton continue to do an amazing job. What i enjoyed most was the transition of Michael corleone from what seemed to be a good guy in the first movie, to a villain by the end of the 2nd film. Again, another long movie that can be somewhat hard to endure its length. But thats definitely not from a lack of drama. If you like drama, this is the movie for you. Male or female, old or young, this movie should interest you."
Phillipfawcettpiano,"Dec 5, 2016",10/10,"It is hard to choose which single Godfather movie should go into my top 50 at the expense of the others. The saga really needs to be taken as a whole - even the 3rd installment, generally seen as the weakest, rounds the epic story off in poetic fashion - and as such would go into my personal top 10 of all-time movies as a trilogy.That said, I single out Godfather II if I must. This is the most self-contained in theme and form, tracking the origins of the Corleone dynasty and the rise to crime of Michael Corleone. It is the ultimate portrayal of a man allowing himself to fall to the corruptions of power , and lose his morality to murderous evil. He is both victim of fate, of forces which seemed to compel him into this monstrous world, and a willful sinner.The final scene, as he sits alone in his spacious grounds reflecting on his life, encapsulates the true theme of this tale: not 'the mafia', not 'murder', not 'American-Italian culture', but that of a human being losing his soul."
yashkadulkar,"May 26, 2020",9/10,I think I found it too deep than it actually is. I mean I'm too sad for whatever events happened throughout the movie. It's a little confusing that you might not feel all the scenes here are important but they are actually. Michael is now the head of the family and has to take some serious decisions for the welfare of the family and himself. The story turns out great and everything looks just at the end. I don't think you should watch it in your happy hours and I'm serious about it!
mrbluto,"Sep 6, 2000",10/10,One of  the three best movie ever made along with Godfather 1 and apocalypse now. Gf two returns to the family and tells the history of how the godfather came to power. The best scene of the movie is when a young Vito returns to Italy and takes revenge on the man that killed his family. A 10 out of ten just like the first movie.
thecineman-99431,"Feb 19, 2021",10/10,"The Godfather: Part II does what a sequel should do, it expands the world and conflicts, giving to the word Family a real meaning by showing the origins of Vitto Corleone, you think is boring because its 3 hours and 20 minutes long but its 100000 times better than the original in every aspect"
pooch-8,"Mar 16, 1999",N/A,"I do not like The Godfather Part II as well as the original, if only because the shift in focus from the subtle machinery of the Corleone family business to the historically inspired (Kefauver hearings, collapse of the Batista regime in Cuba) episodes shortchanges the elegant simplicity of the first film.  We have already witnessed Michael's incredible transformation from ""civilian"" war hero into hard-as-steel overboss in the original, and this makes his character less interesting to me.  I do not wish to suggest that Part II is not a good film.  On the contrary, the intercutting of the Vito Corleone story with Michael's trials, troubles, and challenges gorgeously punctuates the importance of family tradition so crucial to the film's thematic fabric."
luke-a-mcgowan,"Dec 25, 2014",6/10,"The second installment of the Godfather trilogy opens strongly and nails its landing. Unfortunately, the film takes a hard right half an hour in and turns into a convoluted game of Clue that I struggled to understand or care about. Al Pacino, whose transformation was complete at the end of the original masterpiece, does great work and works much of the movie magic where the script allows him to. DeNiro is captivatingly subtle in his role as young Vito Corleone, and the trio of Keaton, Cazale and Duvall, who flew under the radar in the original, do some fantastic work as well. However, the film's plot focuses heavily on a mystery that is too confusing to follow and Francis Ford Coppola falls into the errors of the original by introducing swathes of interchangeable Italian-American men who are impossible to tell apart.As time goes on I am sure that I'll remember the best moments fondly and will be tempted to bump it up, but that will only be because I forgot how agonising it was to sit through 3 hours and 20 minutes."

Unfortunately, I didn't, and found the new Mafia leader to be unlikable and short-tempered compared to the leader from Pt. 1. People who loved Pt. 1 will enjoy this film and the backstory it provides, but for me it was a slog."

This film has another amazing plot, acting, characters etc. And another film I could re watch a thousand times and it wouldn't get old!"
yellowtail_tuna,"May 29, 2020",10/10,"After we had the unforgettable first film, the second film is not just combination of the sequel and prequel, but it is also storytelling by contrasting the two, the rise and decline of Corleone.Vito's part is not just a personal story, but also the history of the United States. Even not as an American, I am very moved to see the immigrants at the harbor staring at the Statue of Liberty at the beggining of the twentieth century, and nine-year-old Vito is just one of them.I can imagine there would be many Vitos in that period, hungry, oppressed young men with dim future, and some of them went for criminal paths. Everything in Vito's era is simple, and limited in the small neighborhood. And everyone is young, probably so is America itself.On the other hand, in Michael's time things have become far more complicated. He has to deal with a governor, negotiating on gambling license. The family has now a bunch of associates running businesses around the country, and among them Michael is not sure who he can trust.After an attempted assassination of Michael in his bedroom, he has to find out not only who is the plotter, but also who is the mole inside. His search leads him to Miami and then Havana. Havana gives the film many beautiful and memorable scenes, and they have also interesting historical background, set in the culmination of the Cuban Revolution.Michael is a cold man. I don't like him. But probably he doesn't like himself more than anyone else. I just feel pity for him. I also feel pity for Key, Fredo, Pentangeli, and anyone else in Michael's era. I wonder what is wrong with Corleone family, when remembering how exhlarating things were in Vito's era.When you are watching the film, probably in your head there is the image of Vito Corleone played by Maron Brando from the first film. Even though the two actors don't look like each other, Robert De Niro's Vito, with the hoarce voice and the elegant hand gesture, makes us believe he is the same Vito as played by Brando.Of course Al Pacino is excellent too, playing the loneliest man, who finds himself in the miserable life that he cannot remember when he chose to go through."
Aditya_Gokhale,"Dec 19, 2005",10/10,"I fell in love with ""The Godfather Part II"" the first time I saw it! And why not? No other movie that runs for a whopping 200 minutes, has held my interest like this one has! There is not a single wasted moment in this long running time. And what's more..it has my most favourite actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starring in it! Words are not enough to describe this great film, and as has rightly been said by many: to call it a sequel is an insult! This is yet another movie that gets better each time you see it.The Godfather Part II tells parallel stories of young Vito Corleone's early life and his son Michael's reign as Don Corleone. The contrast in the two eras has been shown beautifully. The colours used, the sets, the overall feel...everything has been shown to such fine detail, that it becomes impossible to even try and find a flaw in this film! The most important thing to mention here is that the flashback scenes of Vito's life appear at very apt moments! They are not placed haphazardly. Careful attention has been given to their placement, so that they fit beautifully in the present narrative of Michael Corleone.Robert De Niro delivers a mind-blowing performance as the young Vito. He has uncannily managed to look and behave exactly like the young Vito Corleone would (given Brando's depiction of the same character in the first movie). In some scenes it actually feels as if we are watching a young Brando portraying Vito Corleone! Al Pacino is stunning as the cold, ruthless, brooding Michael Corleone! He manages to express so much through his eyes, its almost eerie! John Cazale as Fredo has a lot to do in this movie and he pulls it off wonderfully. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen does complete justice to his role yet again! Other performances worth a very special mention include: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Michael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli, Gaston Moschin as Don Fanucci and G.D. Spradlin as Senator Geary.Diane Keaton is better in this movie than in the first as Kay; Talia Shire as Connie is adequate.Also, special mention about the choice of actors playing the young Tessio and young Clemenza (John Aprea and Bruno Kirby respectively); they actually bear an uncanny resemblance to the older actors playing these same parts in Part I.The cinematography, needless to say, is amazing! The sepia tone makes the film appear like a beautiful painting.... The score: once again, a class apart!This is one ""sequel"" that truly surpasses the original! I try not to call it a sequel as far as possible, because the word ""sequel"" simply doesn't fit! ""The Godfather Part II"" is an offer that no one should/can ever refuse!! To do so would quite simply be a ""crime""....."

dannyrovira-38154,"Jan 13, 2021",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's classic sprawling epic masterpiece of great artistic vision which is undeniably the finest sequel ever made. It is a brilliant continuation to what surely is the greatest gangster saga of all-time, it tells the tale of two generations of the Corleone family; that of Michael Corleone, played brilliantly by Al Pacino in phenomenal Oscar nominated performance, who has now consolidated the power handed down to him by his father the late Don Vito Corleone, and that of the early life of young Don Vito, played magnificently by Robert DeNiro in a breakout Oscar winning performance of great dignity. This epic shows in flashbacks the on going story of the embattled family after Don Vito's death, and the way Young Vito struggles to make a living for his family in New York's Little Italy in 1917, where he meets and befriends a young neighborhood thief named Peter Clemenza, superbly played by the late Bruno Kirby, and together with a few associates they begin their criminal operations of petty thievery, but Vito is always looking out and helping the people around their neighborhood. Vito is forced to kill the local Black Hand boss, the brutal Don Fanucci, played solidly by the late Gastone Moschin, who wants a piece of the action from Vito and his partners. Don Fanucci is also a snake that oppresses and victimizes his own people in the neighborhood, shaking them down for what little money they may have. With Don Fanucci's murder Vito's communal stature grows as does his power, shift to 1958 where Don Michael Corleone is now based in Lake Tahoe and rules his vast empire with an iron fist. He is increasing distrustful and paranoid, and has become cold, ruthless and unemotional. An attempted assassination makes Michael realizes that Hyman Roth, played terrifically by the late Lee Strasberg in Oscar nominated performance, who is an old ally that once worked for his father is now trying kill him. Michael must also find the traitor in his family, as well as deal with a federal indictment, and his failing marriage to Kay Adams, played wonderfully by Diane Keaton. There are tremendous supporting performances by Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talie Shire, Michael V. Gazzo, G.D. Spradlin, Richard Bright, Marianna Hill and Dominic Chianese. Masterful Oscar winning direction by Coppola, with extraordinary cinematography by the late great Gordon Willis, a complex and vivid Oscar winning screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, a lavish Oscar winning production design by Dean Tavoulars, and a dynamic Oscar winning original score by Nino Rota & Carmine Coppola. This American cinematic classic won 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Francis Ford Coppola."
abdulshakooralakkad,"Jul 4, 2021",10/10,"This film is my favorite one from this great trilogy, it's simply a masterpiece. I have never watched anything well-written and perfectly directing like this in my entire life. I re-watched it many times, and every time I discover a new brilliant details. The way that Michael Corleone had changed, and how we saw the development and change of his character was the most amazing part. My favorite scene was when Michael said ""I know it was you, Fredo, you broke my heart.""
Everyone must watch it."
Surecure,"May 24, 2005",10/10,"It can easily be argued that The Godfather Part 2 is the greatest sequel ever crafted in the history of film, and possibly a better film than its predecessor. It is always a difficult task to better a film in its sequel, doubly so when the original film is a masterpiece of cinematic perfection such as the Godfather was. However, Francis Ford Coppola proved that it is possible to improve on perfection.The Godfather Part II is brilliant in the counterpoint created between Vito Corleone's rise to power and Michael Corleone's tragic fall from grace. Each character does what they must in order to strengthen the Corleone family. But, Michael's failures are made even more tragic when juxtaposed against Vito's successes. Whereas Vito was able to strengthen his family's bonds, Michael frays them to tragic ends.Coppola yet again proves his understanding of the relationship between camera and performance. It is not enough to have a lush cinematic experience without engaging performances, and Coppola is able to achieve this masterful balance. The performances by the entire cast are as picture perfect as is possible, and the interaction between even the smallest roles are pristine. Noteworthy is the scene in the Washington Hotel where Kaye (Diane Keaton) opens the eyes of Michael (Al Pacino) to the depths their relationship has achieved. It remains one of the most powerfully performed scenes to ever have been captured on film.Like it's predecessor, The Godfather Part II is one of those rare moments of cinematic perfection, well deserving of its place of reverence in the history of film."

Eclipse-6,"Nov 13, 1998",10/10,"This was a very well put together movie. It showed no flaws. Incredible performances by Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg, Diane Keaton, and Michael V Gazzo."
doguiagb,"Mar 31, 2022",9/10,"""The Godfather, Part II"" moves both forward and backward in time from the events in ""The Godfather,"" in an attempt to resolve our feelings about the Corleones. In doing so, it provides for itself a structural weakness from which the film never recovers, but it does something even more disappointing: It reveals a certain simplicity in Coppola's notions of motivation and characterization that wasn't there in the elegant masterpiece of his earlier film."
seanorafferty,"Jul 9, 2022",10/10,"Just as perfect as the first. It is a bit long, but there are multiple storylines and there are plenty of places where the movie pauses and you can take a break."
