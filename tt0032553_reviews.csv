Steffi_P,"Oct 18, 2010",9/10,"Back at the dawn of the talkie era, Charlie Chaplin defended his decision not to start making sound films by saying ""The moment the little tramp talks, he's dead"". He was right of course. His comic persona was the creation of an era in cinema when words and voices were irrelevant. The little tramp's appeal lay entirely in how he did things, not in what he was supposed to be saying. And yet it was inevitable that if Chaplin wanted to continue in the business he would have to cave in eventually. Besides Chaplin's agenda was itself changing, and he had now reached a point in his life where he really wanted to speak to the world.Many of the early scenes in The Great Dictator seem to prove Chaplin's fears about sound film. The slapstick has lost its flow, looking forced and awkward. And it appears Chaplin has no real idea how to write or direct dialogue. Sometimes characters make some banal little comment on the action as if simply to fill up the silence. Even worse things happen when Chaplin attempts verbal humour, resorting to feeble puns like the one about the gas keeping him awake all night (not that puns are necessarily bad, just that Chaplin isn't very good at them). Above all, the visual and verbal business is poorly integrated, with a badly-timed stop-start feel. It makes it particularly jarring after a dialogue scene to see this ageing version of the little tramp doing some of his old moves, such as teetering on one foot as he runs into a squad of stormtroopers. These scenes are unlikely to raise more than a titter, and are a sad testament to the fact that this familiar character was past his prime and out of time.But this is a tale of two Charlies. For the first time in decades Chaplin creates a new character for himself in dictator Adenoid Hynkel. And the great thing about Hynkel is that he sidesteps Chaplin's inability with comedy in words but still makes use of comedy in sound. The dictator's cod-Germanic speech is part silly-voice, part linguistic nonsense and it is very, very funny. It actually adds to the humour that no-one else in the picture speaks it, and that Hynkel mostly lapses into it in moments of anger, as if it was some involuntary anxiety-driven affectation. The other great thing about Hynkel is that he is one of Chaplin's great works of satire. The nonsense language is of course a lampooning of Hitler's forceful speechmaking, but the parody continues through everything Hynkel does. Take for example when he has finished posing with the baby, and rather disgustedly wipes his hand clean. He does it with the same stiff-faced disdain that Hitler always displayed in public, but the character's puffed-up austerity is also being punctured by the fact that he's just got his hand covered in wee wee. The little tramp, a creation of and for the silent era, could not make the transition to sound. But Hynkel is a creation of and for the sound era, and he works fantastically.As the picture unfolds, it begins to gain maturity and clarity, not to mention comic brilliance. Jack Oakie's Napoloni makes a perfect partner for Hynkel, and their antics together are like the Marx Brothers at their most riotous. Napoloni is also a work of satire equal to Hynkel, with Oakie working in many of Mussolini's less dignified mannerisms, such as curling his lip and bulging his eyes like he's trying to squeeze out a fart. While Chaplin's direction is at its most overt and showy, he also cleverly and subtly gears his compositions towards ridicule, making the most of those tall set designs to show off the dictator as some little twerp. And finally, the picture acquires the poignancy that made Chaplin's silent features stand out, this time with an extra bite in the seriousness of its message. It is then that you realise Chaplin knew his little tramp was finished, and yet that he needed him here to deliver his point. By subjecting him to sound, Chaplin sacrifices his alter-ego, making a means to speak his mind to the public who had loved him."
barrysheene,"Mar 6, 2004",9/10,"..this movie has been done when Hitler ( and Mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the Roman Church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in USA there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in Germany and Europe ( Charles Lindenbergh for example ).It would be as today a big actor would made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration he was a courageous man. The movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever done."
muzikla,"Jan 23, 2005",10/10,"I was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today."
donnola,"Jun 5, 2002",N/A,"Released in 1940, ""The Great Dictator"" was the first Hollywood film that denounced Hitler directly (albeit in the guise of Adenoid Hynkel), took a virulent stand against fascism, and directly addressed Anti-Semitism.Over-long, at times heavy-handed, it still has many wonderful sequences, including the famous dance with the globe, and all the scenes of Chaplin with Jack Oakie, each trying to out-do the other and prove his superiority.One criticism that seems to occasionally rear its head is the implication that Chaplin's pre-World War II anti-fascism was somehow wrong-headed. The atrocities of the Holocaust weren't fully known to the world yet, so Chaplin's anti-Hitler diatribe is, in the minds of some, misguided. After the war this mindset would result in the debacle of the blacklist, when Chaplin, among others, were branded ""pre-mature anti-fascists."" In other words, it wasn't politically acceptable to be against Nazism until war broke out with the U.S. Hard to believe anyone could still see things that way now, but some do.The film industry of the 1930s wanted no part of international politics, no matter how blatant the brutality of a given regime. Profits were at stake. It was little goyisha Charley Chaplin, playing a Jewish barber, who took a public stand.While ""The Great Dictator"" may not among Chaplin's finest films, it may, historically, be his finest hour."
adamonIMDb,"Aug 5, 2017",10/10,"The tagline of 'The Great Dictator' is 'the comedy masterpiece', and I couldn't think of a better line to sum this film up. It's a hilarious political satire, but it also delivers a vitally important message. This film was released at the time when Hitler was at the height of his power and the main character, dictator Hynkel, is obviously a reference to him.Charlie Chaplin is simply outstanding in this film in what was his first spoken role. To play two completely different characters, Hynkel and the Jewish barber, so convincingly in the same film is truly remarkable. Chaplin's speech at the end, which is very much HIS speech even though he's playing a character, is a piece of cinema I will never forget. Such a powerful, moving and compelling speech that remains relevant even today.Making a comedy out of such a tragedy is risky business, but Chaplin's anti-fascist message ensured it wasn't taken the wrong way. 'The Great Dictator' is a hilarious but meaningful and powerful film. A brilliant piece of cinema."
ma-cortes,"Mar 3, 2009",8/10,"This ingenious and innovate comedy packs many priceless moments and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber's chair , among them .Production on the movie started in 1937 and shot in 539 days when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace , as was the case when it was released in 1940 ; however , this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to its satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America . The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wives , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished The Great Dictator . The picture was released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities was the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland . This movie was Charles Chaplin's biggest-ever box-office hit , grossing about $5 million at the time."
Cineleyenda,"Oct 29, 2001",10/10,"The Great Dictator is a beyond-excellent film.  Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism.  The anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. Throughout this movie, I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work."
Xstal,"Oct 20, 2020",9/10,"... and in today's parlance that means regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation but you might struggle to know it with the polarisation that continually pulls us apart, doing more damage to culture and society than any aspiring dictator could ever do.A truly great piece of cinema from a truly great performer and genius, whose closing speech mirrors many of the concerns we perpetually live with today and to which we can add climate change and military AI as we enhance our quest for annihilation, extinction and mutually assured destruction."
slokes,"May 19, 2013",7/10,"Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, ""The Great Dictator"" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process.There are two reasons to like ""The Great Dictator."" One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny.Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, ""Dictator"" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept ""Phooey"" (a. k. a. ""Führer"") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in.The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have ""perfected"" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: ""Far from perfect."")Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: ""What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!""The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto.The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of ""machine men with machine minds"" as if he was still making ""Modern Times"" and punching the sky at times for lame effect.To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, ""The Great Dictator"" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances."
tera1724,"Jun 18, 2020",10/10,"Despite being released in 1940, this incredible movie highlights the importance of human values. It is true that it was in the context of what historically happened. But more importantly, it discusses subjects and problems that all humanity will face eternally because of the human nature; which makes it relatable to any generation, on a bigger or smaller scale.
The fact that the movie is in black and white, in my opinion, is oddly undisturbing, as it reinforces its historical value; that movies in colors would not be the same.
At last, this piece of art is undeniably one of Chaplin's most successful productions, bringing any viewer to tears at the end of the most iconic speech. The music is lifting, adequate, the acting perfect as the actors barely needed to act -it seemed so real- ; all that topped with Chaplin's personal touch of satiric comedy, artistic intelligence, and melancholic nature.
That movie made Charlie Chaplin my idol. I would be glad to watch it again and again, every time seeing something new."
stamper,"May 31, 2004",6/10,"The main thing that bothered me in The Great Dictator, is that it is too lengthy for what it's supposed to be. There just isn't an intriguing story here (or one that should be spread out as long as it has). I know this film is supposed to be a spoof of Hitler, but it fails at that, because there are just a few comic scenes that could have easily been put in a 20 minute feature (this would have stopped the repeating of several funny' or should I say tiresome gags as well). I hear you say though: but there STILL is a love story. Well sorry mates, that one is quite a bummer as well, because there are no real emotions there and the viewer is not shown how the barber and Hannah fall in love, you just have to assume it was love at first sight. The ending is NOT at all original and the final words that hit the viewer, just before the lights go out are understandably a bit idealistic (which makes them seem a bit cheesy now). But remember, back in 1940 people all over the world didn't yet know what was happening in Germany and they still though worse things might be prevented. In conclusion, I must say that I admire Chaplin's craftsmanship and his guts to make this film, yet I also feel a bit bewildered why this ranks so high in IMDB's top 250. Maybe it's the intention or the idea behind the film. All I can say is, that watched out of it's original context in the 21st century, this film comes off way worse than other things I've seen by Chaplin. It's just not funny, too unemotional and too long to be good.Still a 6 out of 10"
PaulSquall,"Jul 22, 2009",2/10,"This is supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I will contend that it is actually one of his weaker films. First of all, it's not funny. Not one thing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle, but that was one of desperation. The Tramp's first - and only - talkie where he speaks (he sings in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in ""Modern Times"" and ""Gold Rush"" - two films that are at least ten times better than this film. There's literally only one good scene in this film, the one where Hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball. That's it.Okay, so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war, even long before we entered the war. Nope. Not true. Simply not true, so that praise can be turned down a bit. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with ""You Natzy Spy"" - ten months earlier than the October release of Chaplin's film - and that movie was actually funny! If you want to watch Chaplin's greatest film, watch this only for reference. And then pop in ""Modern Times"", ""Gold Rush"", ""City Lights"", ""Limelight"", ""The Kid"", or even ""Tillie's Punctured Romance""."
Val-22,"Jan 7, 1999",N/A,"Aside from giving this film its proper socio-historical credit as one of only 2 U.S films which condemned Hitler, Naziism and the Holocaust prior to U.S. involvement in WWII, it's a great time as well.  Much of the humor remains visual, and some of the funniest (and most famous) scenes are done in the silent mode (e.g. the globe).  Although a bit more lacking in continuity and editing than many of Chaplin's earlier films, to do it credit simply as a passable first effort at a new medium is to damn it with faint praise.  It's unique.  No serious student of film can neglect to see and appreciate The Great Dictator as a classic amalgam of film talents."
Platymania,"Dec 22, 2003",9/10,"This film entered production before WW2 began, but was not released until it was well under way. With significant fascist-sympathy in the US, and Chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser, The Great Dictator was a very courageous endeavour. Such risks in film-making - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost inconceivable today. Imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the USA's foreign policy?This film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end, but it is already to late - for him and for us. A must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history, film-making, politics or sattire as an art-form."
AttilaD87,"Nov 2, 2008",9/10,"The Great Dictator is Chaplin's parody about the Nazi Germany with scenes that make you laugh no matter in what mood you are.Beside this ,from my point of view the movie's best part is the superb speech by the Jewish Barber ,a speech's thoughts that if would existed a little bit in Hitler's mind too it would had a chance for the world too pas a second world war.The Speech: ""I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.That's not my business.I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.I should like to help everyone: Jew, gentile, black man, white.We all want to help one another.Human beings are like that.We want to live by each other's happiness, not misery.We don't want to hate one another.In this world, the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.The way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way.Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into bloodshed.We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in.Machinery has left us in want.Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.We think too much and feel too little.More than machinery we need humanity.More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...The airplane and radio have brought us closer.These inventions cry out for the goodness in man, cry out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.Even now my voice is reaching millions, millions of despairing men, women and children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.The misery upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took will return to the people.So long as men die liberty will never perish.Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives, tell you what to think and feel, who drill you, treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder.Don't give yourselves to these men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in you.Don't hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty! St Luke says, ""The Kingdom of God is within man."" Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you! You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.You have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.In the name of democracy, let us use that power.Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.Promising these things, brutes have risen.But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!"""
The_Movie_Cat,"Sep 2, 2000",8/10,"When a film opens with the above note, referring to Chaplin's dual role, but also a cheeky dig at the fact that Hynkel is a not-at-all disguised parody of Hitler, you know exactly what you're in for. This two-hour long lambasting of the Nazi regime may not be subtle, but by God Chaplin knew how to rip the p***.If rumours are to be believed, Hitler had him placed at the top of his death list after this film's release – now that's street cred. We first see Adenoid Hynkel addressing the German (Tomanian) nation, giving a speech that involves much arm-saluting, nonsense English that makes use of the phrase ""sour kraut"" and his more embittered rages descending into coughing fits. ""His excellency has just referred to the Jewish people"", informs an announcer after a rage-filled moment that causes microphones to bend and quiver in fear. His first German-language dictates to his minister of war (Herring) involve ""banana"" and ""cheeseuncrackerz"". Look out too for instructions to his Minister of Interiors, Garbitsch.I've never really gotten into Charlie (always credited as Charles) Chaplin, as I find his innocent sentimentality a little hard to get to grips with in today's society. W.C.Fields, and, to an extent, Harold Lloyd and Laurel & Hardy can still entertain, as they have something of the attitude, or edge, that Chaplin lacks. Ironically, it's modern times that mean we now find it hard to fully appreciate Modern Times. However, dialogue and a harsher undercurrent – including a Jewish barber (Chaplin, again) being hung from a lamppost mean that even today The Great Dictator is relevant.There are some nice silly jokes, such as the barber, confronted by a Stormtrooper, being told: ""and I thought you were an Arian"". ""Well, I'm a veget – arian"", replies Chaplin, trying to fit in. Many jokes – such as Hynkel making a long speech and his secretary typing up just a couple of words; then saying just a couple of words only for her to translate it into paragraphs – were originated here and have been repeated countless times in other places. Some of the most amusing slapstick is when Hynkel meets fellow dictator Mussolini (Napaloni), and tries to impress him by having the greater psychological perspective in all their meetings. In a gag much honoured by Bugs Bunny, the two crank themselves up to ever-greater heights on barber's chairs.Elsewhere, the film also has a grand scale, with ceilings on sets and news reports propelling the narrative – you know, the sort of thing Citizen Kane was so highly praised for the following year. If there's a fault with this film then it's not so much with the sentimental, whiter-than-white Jewish population, but with Chaplin's interpretation of Hynkel. Although he gets all the best jokes and scenes, he's simply too likable to really convey the threat Chaplin was trying to stop. Nevertheless, this is forgotten as the ending gives us the Jewish barber taking Hynkel's place, and Chaplin making an impassioned, three-minute speech in the name of freedom.Charles Chaplin played two roles in this movie, wrote, directed, produced and, uncredited, composed original music for it. To claim it changed the world is an overstatement. America still had a good opinion of Hitler at the time, and, after it was released... they still had a good opinion of Hitler. It was still some time before they would even enter the second world war, and with the final speech being adopted for Communist pamphlets in England, this only caused Chaplin troubles when it came to the McCarthy witch trials. There's a sense that Chaplin isn't the master in the field of talkies, and that his use of mime was beginning to date. History was overtaking him, but The Great Dictator still stands as one of the most personal, and risk-taking films ever put on celluloid.Postscript, April 2012: I've since watched all of Chaplin's features and every short. So, I was talking rubbish when I said twelve years ago that he didn't have modern appeal. Sorry about that. However, I stand by most of the review, even if ""Chaplin on Hitler's death list"" is a ""fact"" I've only read in Trivial Pursuits. Oh, look out for the documentary that's included on the DVD - ""The Tramp and the Dictator"" - well worth seeing, as well as Chaplin's extensive thoughts on this film and its aftermath in his 1964 autobiography."
TheLittleSongbird,"Aug 14, 2010",10/10,"Along with The Gold Rush, Modern Times and City Lights(my personal favourite) this is one of my favourites from Charlie Chaplin. The Great Dictator is just a wonderful satire on the Anti-Semitic Nazi regime- Hitler mayn't have got the joke in this comedy, but I think he got the point.The Great Dictator looks great, with some great dialogue and a chockful of great moments, comedic or not. It is also excellently directed, and features wonderful performances from Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie and especially the comedy genius himself. The Great Dictator has many great moments as I've said, but three scenes stand out especially. One is the barber dancing in time to a Hungarian dance by Brahms. Another is Hynkel's solo ballet with a globe of the world. My favourite though is the final speech, pleading for universal tolerance. Mawkish and outrageous it is, but also very powerful and quite ambitious if you put it in context(I can only imagine the controversy that scene alone caused).Overall, wonderful and powerful. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
mossgrymk,"Oct 8, 2023",6/10,"Turned it off after an hour (which begs the question, Isn't two hours plus a bit LONG for a comedy?) for the simple reason that I wasn't laughing much and a lot of the time that I wasn't laughing I was bored. Yeah, Hynkel's speech and the globe/balloon routine are legitimate classics but when Chaplin plays the barber he is downright dull. The scene where he clumsily shaves a customer has to be one of the least risible comic bits this great actor has ever done. And the stuff with Paulette Goddard is alarmingly sentimental, even by Chaplin standards. I'm coming around to the opinion shared by many Chaplin lovers that, aside from ""King In NY"", the advent of sound was the comic bell tolling for this fellow. C plus."
mysteryegg,"Jun 21, 2005",4/10,"What makes this film great is the historical context in which is was made. Having been made early in the second world war, this film is a great spectacle of wartime propaganda and satire against Hitler. Unfortunately, as Charlie Chaplin's first talkie, his well-renowned comedic timing suffers in the film. Chaplin's signature comedic walking makes one appearance, and his signature suit makes about two. All in all, visual gags are only provided every 15 minutes or so. This is understandable, as he is mocking Hitler for half the film, and he's attempting to replace visual gags with something more appropriate for a talkie. His pseudo-German is hysterical, but he relies on it too heavily. English dialog is extremely dumbed down compared to the Marx Brothers' films of the same period, leaving political jargon that, rather than having satirical merit, tends to simply slow down the film. After an hour of bearing with this shortcoming, the film does pick up slightly, especially after a turning point in the film involving new diplomacy. We do get a nice idealistic speech at the end that reveals some of Chaplin's political views.As for the aggression against Jews in the film, one might expect Chaplin to turn the scenes into something similar to chase scenes from his silent films. Modern films, on the other hand, tend to develop the victims in the film well enough so we can feel some connection. In other words, I would expect to feel the need to either laugh or cry if Chaplin were to depict this kind of situation. Unfortunately scenes are more uncomfortable to watch than they are compelling.Perhaps this film is highly regarded for what it stands for, but as a fan of Chaplin's silent films, as well as a huge fan of comedic talkies from this era, I felt highly disappointed and nearly fell asleep watching the film."
Ermengarde,"Nov 2, 2004",N/A,"I agree that the final speech is powerful, and stirring. It made my heart hurt (in a good way ;-) But I also have to say that the comedy is first-rate. When the Charlie and the pilot are unknowingly upside down and chatting away...when the pilot is serenely reminiscing about his girlfriend back home even as the downed plane plows right into the ground...when Hynkel delivers this vitriolic diatribe about 'the Juden' and the blandly impassive translator says, 'the Phooey has just made reference to the Jewish people' and 'the Phooey's heart is full of love to all mankind,' ...when Hynkel strips his hapless henchman of all his beautiful medals, spitting and fussing a mile a minute...I could go on and on! I think no one else on earth could play Hynkel as hilariously as Chaplin, but it might be fun to imagine modern comedians trying. ;-)"
jlgmve,"Aug 9, 2021",10/10,"I'm not a big fan of old movies, every now and then I give the classics a chance to expand my horizons a bit and judge whether their fame can meet the expectations of a modern audience. I must say that I loved it, it is an excellent critic of Nazi Germany and Hitler. The message the film leaves you is still as relevant now as it was 80 years ago.If you are a young person like me who is on the fence about whether it is worth watching, I would ask you to give it a try."
bkoganbing,"Nov 30, 2010",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin certainly put off speaking on cinema long enough. His bread and butter was made with his little tramp character on the silent screen. But when Chaplin finally did speak he spoke some of the most memorable prose ever spoken on the cinema. The eloquence of his appeal for universal brotherhood is maybe more relevant today than even back in 1940 when he decided to satirize Nazi Germany in The Great Dictator.In his memoirs Chaplin said that he would never have made The Great Dictator had he suspected for a moment exactly the extent of what was going on in Nazi Germany. It was bad enough in 1940, but of course Hitler's final solution doctrine about systematic extermination wasn't put in place until the following year. After that Nazi Germany provided damn few laughs.As the film opens Chaplin hearkens back to his World War I classic Shoulder Arms when we see him as a bumbling soldier during World War I. He saves the life of air ace Reginald Gardiner, but in doing so is injured and loses his memory. Some fifteen years later Charlie regains his memory and leaves the hospital and returns to his profession as barber in the Jewish quarter of his native city.No one notices, but the little barber with the funny mustache bears no small resemblance to the dictator of his country of Ptomania, Adenoid Hynkel. And as it turns out Reginald Gardiner who is a storm trooper commandant gets reacquainted with his savior and has a reassessment of his feelings about Jews. Of course in the end that resemblance proves to be Gardiner and Chaplin's salvation and in Chaplin's fantasy world the salvation of humanity.In his Hynkel persona Chaplin was the first on the screen to satirize Hitler, to make him an object of ridicule. Later on when America was finally in World War II in some of our lesser propaganda efforts, Hitler impersonators like Bobby Watson leaned heavily on what Chaplin did in The Great Dictator. Of course his best Hynkel moment is the famous dream scene where the globe becomes a big beach ball type balloon with Chaplin lovingly treating it in the best fetishistic manner.As the barber Chaplin also goes back to his little tramp roots and is seen giving one of his customers a shave to the music of Brahm's Number 5 Dance could have been done in any of his silent classics.Chaplin's final speech was a masterpiece. People like Orson Welles, Paul Muni, and Spencer Tracy are probably the players most noted for giving long addresses well on screen, but for a man whose cinematic career was spent in silence up to that point, Chaplin was nothing short of brilliant. When the Tramp finally spoke, what profound things he had to say.The Great Dictator made a pile of money for United Artists of whom one of the partners was Charlie Chaplin. It received five Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Chaplin, Best Supporting Actor for Jack Oakie, Best Musical Score for Meredith Willson, and Best Original Screenplay for Chaplin. Curiously enough Charlie wasn't nominated for Best Director.Casting Jack Oakie as the spoof dictator Nappoloni based on that other Axis partner Mussolini was a stroke of genius. Oakie played loudmouth blowhards his entire film career and as Nappoloni of Bacteria, Oakie played one of the biggest blowhards in history. Oakie lost to Walter Brennan for The Westerner and Chaplin gave way to Jimmy Stewart in The Philadelphia Story. Chaplin did win the New York Film Critic's Award for Best Actor in 1940.Others worthy of note are Charlie's then estranged wife Paulette Goddard as the barber's love interest. Paulette who was Paulette Levy by birth played a Jew for maybe the only time in her career. Henry Daniell is minister of propaganda Garbitsch and he's his usual cold and cynical, but Charlie should have gotten Martin Kosleck who got a lot of work during World War II with a dead-on impersonation of Joseph Goebbels. For Air Minister Herring who would you get for the weight challenged Herman Goerring, but Billy Gilbert.In a world where a lot of self seeking politicians and terrorists appeal to the worst in man, The Great Dictator is timeless because of its appeal to the better angels of our nature as James Madison phrased it. Never miss this when it is broadcast it will renew your human spirit."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 2, 2021",10/10,"I hadn't watched a Charlie Chaplin movie for ages. I'd seen this a long time ago. I resurrected my admiration for the guy. First of all, the pure physical comedy is phenomenal. The choreographed fight scenes are priceless. Then there is his persona as a variant of the little tramp, this time as a Jewish barber who has had amnesia for twenty years. But the courageous parody portrayal of the disgusting figures of World War II is great. It it weren't so tragic it would be even funnier. Just the names of the figures alone are great. Paulette Godard is really fun and has a strong female voice. It's a terrific film in every aspect."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 7, 2005",10/10,"I would say that ""The Great Dictator"" is Charlie Chaplin's best movie ever. Mainly a spoof of Hitler, but also reminding us about tyranny in any form, the movie was Chaplin's first talkie. Probably the funniest aspect is his mockery of German: dictator Adenoid Hynkel stands up on the podium and rants something that sounds like: ""Eh, de Holstein und de Aryan maiden und de strangulation itten. Kapeet! Kapatt! Deutsch Juden...grrr deutsch Juden!"" Another great scene is when he's arguing with the Mussolini character about the Ostralich border, and their argument almost turns into a catfight.Seeing how he pointed the finger at all tyranny, it's easy to see why HUAC used this movie to kick Chaplin out of the country. No matter, Chaplin ended up getting the last laugh; not only did the Oscars eventually give him an honorary Oscar, but the world remembers him as one of the greatest directors in history."
pere-25366,"Jul 15, 2016",10/10,"The Great Dictator is an exceptional film that sees Chaplin shine in a dual role. The only shred of resemblance shared by these two protagonists is their appearance, which plays out in a very clever manner as the film progresses. The satirical manner in which Chaplin carries out Hynkel's oratory is comedy at its finest. Seamlessly blending both comical ingenuity and serious subject matter, The Great Dictator is a hilarious and pensive film produced to perfection. The now famous anti-Nazi speech given at the end is nothing short of mesmerizing. Making an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill, Chaplin deliver's one of the most introspective speeches in cinema history. Chaplin's first true sound film more than stands the test of time after almost 80 years and is quite simply one of the most magnificent films ever crafted."
filipemanuelneto,"Mar 16, 2020",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's first spoken film, most famous for his silent films, is also one of the most striking in his career, as it is a fun, deeply critical satire on Nazi Germany. It should be noted that Hitler was an admirer of Chaplin's work, to the point of copying his mustache. I doubt that it continued after this film, but we will never know.The film itself is entertaining and was skillfully used as anti-Nazi propaganda material inside and outside the United States. It's not quite a comedy ... it's more of a satire. Personally, I had no problem with an amusing Hitler or laughing at the Third Reich. The way in which Chaplin caricatured Hitler becomes pertinent in the face of the German monster's attitudes. Sometimes satirizing is a way of saying very serious things without making it seem heavy. Perhaps even heavier and deeper is Chaplin's interpretation as a Jew in this same film. It's not fun, he never makes jokes about the way Jews are treated, on the contrary: it shows the brutality and abuse of authorities and soldiers well.The dialogues are excellent, especially the famous final speech where Chaplin truly makes an overt and evident political appeal. The props, costumes and sets are also very good. In addition to Chaplin, who carries the film on his back, the cast features Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie and Reginald Gardiner, all of whom are very good but unable to steal the protagonist's shine."
MrskiViletic,"May 19, 2019",10/10,"To call ""The Great Dictator"" an excellent film would be an understatement. It is one of the masterpieces of classic cinema brought to us by a Hollywood pioneer and one of the most beloved people of the 20th century. It is a satire of Nazi Germany released in the height of their power and the invasion of Europe. A slap in the face of tyranny and bloodthirsty rulers all across the globe, but particularly aimed at Nazi Germany. Even thought it has such a serious theme the movie is still filled to the brim with laughs and shenanigans that can only be delivered by Chaplin. It shows you the absurdness of fascism and Nazism by openly lampooning its philosophy and its leaders, but also it has a subtle message of terror showing us what happens when such people get in place of power. It all culminates with one of the most iconic speeches in cinematic history that resounds with people all around the globe to this day. A must watch for any fan of comedy, history and cinema!"
chera_khalid,"Feb 19, 2025",6/10,"The Great Dictator (1940) is an undeniably important film, both historically and cinematically, but for me, it didn't fully resonate. While I can appreciate Charlie Chaplin's bold political satire and the significance of mocking fascism at a time when few dared, the heavy reliance on comedy didn't appeal to my taste. The exaggerated slapstick humor, particularly in scenes with Hynkel and Napaloni, felt over-the-top rather than engaging. However, I do recognize the film's strengths, such as its message about humanity and the power of Chaplin's final speech, which was easily the best part of the movie. The contrast between humor and serious themes was interesting, but I personally prefer a more direct or dramatic approach to such topics. While I respect its legacy, I found it more admirable than enjoyable, hence my 6/10 rating."
PseudoFritz,"Aug 8, 2006",4/10,"Maybe this was *An Important Movie* and that's why people rank it so highly, but honestly it isn't very good. In hindsight it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos, so you can't fault him TOO much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnect remains.More disappointingly, the movie is just clunky; it's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era. The set pieces, those involving both the Jewish Barber and the Dictator, don't flow into each other; they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts, moving SOMEWHERE but never arriving at resolution. Some are funny, some less so.What charm the movie has is strictly in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing, and there's no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch. But virtually everything he surrounded himself with was ANNOYING. Hannah was TOO DAMN American. The Storm Troopers were TOO DAMN American.Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I don't know what purpose was served by having Garbage be the source of evil behind the throne. It almost seems like the film is saying that, if it weren't for malign influences like Garbage, Hynckle wouldn't have been that bad a guy."
tedg,"Aug 6, 2000",N/A,"I find this film remarkable. Here you have a man at the peak of his celebrity who has some moral responsibility. How rare! Imagine Michael Jordan risking all (and eventually losing all) in order to do the right thing. This film is a multidimensional risk: he is trying to master the talkie (though his talent is in the visual), he is trying to mix tragedy and comedy (always a hard mix, and nearly impossible when using current events) and he is trying to actually effect his audience, to counter evil in the land.One must remember that when this was started, Hitler was generally admired in the US and essentially no one at all was standing up for the Jews. (In the film: `first we get the Jews, and then the brunettes.')I think he succeeds so far as the talkie, but he doesn't stand at the top of the heap, and several years before, the Marx brothers had made their own, superior, antiwar movie (Duck Soup). He succeeds in mixing comedy and tragedy only by alternating, and extending the length of the film.Concerning his effectiveness in countering evil: his impassioned speech at the end is powerful. But it appears to have had no effect whatsoever. This is the man that McCarthy and friends drove from the US! I think one of his mistakes was portraying the pogrom and invasions as the work of one man, rather than of a whole nation: Germans, not Nazis."
aphillipsdakota,"May 30, 2021",10/10,"Chaplin was a man ahead of his time. In my opinion his speech from this film is the greatest speech of all time. It's scary knowing what Charlie fought for and fought against is still going on today. It's reassuring knowing this speech exist. As Charlie says, ""You, the People, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure."" Now in our own time with this pandemic coming to an end and people recovering from fear from recent politicians perhaps we too can unite, not just as a country, but as a world and ""do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance."" as another wise man once said ""With our love we could save the world."" Thanks to Charlie we are given some wise words in his speech and We shall Overcome."
EstebanPerez-,"Apr 15, 2019",10/10,"It's a great movie!
Charles Chaplin is able to communicate in a funny and nostalgic way, a story that marked the history of humanity and brought us a message of union and social fraternity.At the most critical moment in history, Charles Chaplin manages to ridicule Adolf Hitler and his message of war.It contains one of the most beautiful and motivating scenes of cinema."
curtiscobb,"Mar 3, 2018",10/10,"For some inexusable reason, I didn't see this movie for the first time until I was in my mid-20s. . I've since tried to atone for that negligence by watching it at every opportunity. I've always believed in the power of satire as an effective weapon in the war against injustice and evil, and The Great Dictator is a satirical masterpiece created by the original celluloid master-satirist. I've heard the same rumors that many have noted about the supposed lukewarm attitude Chaplin had about Hitler's regime, but a simple glance at the production and release dates of this film should once and finally put an end to that disinformation. This was not only a brilliantly hilarious lampooning of a vile ideology, I consider it to be the Gold Standard of cinematic satire. I can only hope that the lucky few Jewish survivors of the Nazi's inhumanity who saw this movie found it in some small way satisfying. For everyone else, I I hope it communicated effectively its (I believe) intended message that, although we'll never extinguish evil everywhere, we should ridicule it relentlessly when and wherever it's found"
zetes,"Sep 16, 2000",8/10,"I once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months back. I thought every minute of what I was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and I didn't want to spoil the whole thing if I were to watch it from the start, I decided that I would rent it immediately. Well, the video store which I frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had previous to that experience only seen some Chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after I saw the snippet of The Great Dictator, I checked out three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times (City Lights was great, I found the Gold Rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and I found Modern Times to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen (second funniest, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more exactly).Finally, the whole of the Great Dictator. Well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. But these moments don't always mix well. Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. Plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of Chaplin's talent. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie as a whole, but I thought it of little consequence. I would have given it a solid 7/10 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. The final speech that the Jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. Yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech brought me to tears, and I consider it one of the best endings I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10."
fredrikgunerius,"Oct 25, 2024",10/10,"Not much is more difficult than making valid satire without the luxury of temporal distance, and not much is more difficult than combining satire and comedy into an amalgamation of intelligent and entertaining art. With The Great Dictator, his first sound film, Charlie Chaplin succeeded on both those accounts, just as WWII was breaking out in Europe and Hitler revealed himself to be the madman the pessimists had prophesied. With its large budget and wonderful sets, The Great Dictator has grandeur and panache, but as always with Chaplin's films, it's the little man and his girl who are the emotional focal point. And although Chaplin technically had left his Tramp character behind, the Jewish barber we meet in this film retains most of his characteristics. Again the theme is the little man's heroic fight against injustice, only this time the injustice is more elaborate and emblematic, giving the filmmaker a lot more ammunition - so to speak - to work with. The picture goes from wonderful slapstick comedy via delightful absurdism to heartfelt humanism. And it never feels forced, conceited or dull. A true triumph of moviemaking and ethics. And, sadly, also a film of eternal relevance."
rgpaeplrp,"Jun 28, 2025",8/10,"The Great Dictator is a bold film, and I respect how Chaplin uses satire to tackle something as horrifying and complex as fascism - since it came out in 1940 when a lot of the reality was still hidden. Chaplin's dual performance is impressive. The comedic timing, the subtle emotional depth - it's a masterclass in balancing humor and heart. But it's not without flaws. Watching it now, I can't help but question if comedy is always the right approach for portraying something as devastating as Hitler's regime. There are moments when the tonal shifts between slapstick and tragedy feel a bit uneasy, almost inappropriate given the historical context we now understand. Still, Chaplin's bravery in making such a direct critique is undeniable. And that final speech - sure, it's direct, maybe a little preachy for modern tastes, but it feels real and heartfelt, and it still resonates today. Despite some reservations about its tone, I think The Great Dictator remains a powerful, important film that's earned its place as a classic."
eeklon,"Dec 20, 2005",6/10,"I sat down a couple of hours ago with every intention of enjoying this Chaplin classic - one that I have not seen in about 40 years. It appeared to have everything going for it, a good cast, two handfuls of Oscar nominations and an interesting plot with a strong anti-Nazi slant. All this appealing to me. Instead of laughing and getting in the swing of the film I found myself complaining -to myself- that for 1940 the movie, the camera work, the sets, the script and dialogue, the music and the way information and emotion was presented -ie humor and pathos- were hopelessly outdated. Jack Oakie's character -who garnered an Oscar nomination ???- alternated between a Marx Brothers Italian accent and a ""dem-deese-does"" Brooklyn one. It appeared to me that Chaplin had not progressed in his thinking or in his technical skills at all since his silent days. It was like watching a silent movie to which sound has been added as an after thought. In the film's final speech, after which NONE of the issues set up by the plot are resolved, I was prepared for your basic emotional appeal and was not disappointed. However I did find myself wondering why a Jewish barber would be quoting the Book of Luke? And so it went. I found myself wondering if my time would have been better spent watching, ""You Nazty Spy"" the 3 Stooges film that came out 9 months before the Great Dictator."
drqshadow-reviews,"Apr 17, 2020",7/10,"Charlie Chaplin's famously prescient tear-down of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, filmed at the very outset of the second world war (England actually vowed to ban the film due to an early policy of Nazi appeasement, though their attitude flipped before opening day) and released before anyone really understood the height of the German atrocities. Chaplin himself would later express a certain degree of remorse, admitting he never would've made the picture if he'd known just how far the Nazis had gone.It's an important film, certainly an emphatically heartfelt one, and an astoundingly timely message, but it's also plagued with minor quibbles. A handful of conceptually proficient cornerstone scenes, genuine big-screen magic, are good enough to enhance the whole act. Chaplin's mesmerizing bubble dance with an inflatable globe, as a shining example. A cheeky shave-and-a-haircut routine, expertly timed to match the Brahms playing on a grainy box radio. His passionate, enduring speech at the film's climax, eyes locked upon the camera, which still rings, honest and true, in today's combative social climate.At the best of times it's a brilliant example of all Chaplin could offer as an entertainer; a perfect mix of silent film pantomime, well-timed musical accompaniment and passionate, assertive rhetoric. At other points, he clearly struggles with the urge to do what he's always done. To cast aside modern soundtrack demands and merely focus on telling the story through sheer physical poetry. Apart from those few radiant examples, his instinct doesn't come as naturally as it once did. Not every scene works. The plot jerks along in stops and starts. As the film's running time grows cumbersome, we miss essential scraps of story, cutting straight to the finish before each piece is properly aligned. Though Chaplin's noble Jewish barber ultimately gets his moment in the sun, his alternate role as the scheming Hitler-lite despot is hardly served a well-deserved comeuppance.The Great Dictator, essentially Chaplin's last bow as an international icon, gives us much to appreciate, and much to ponder, but a wobbly structure and off-kilter rhythm leaves a lot of its seething, righteous cinematic power unrealized."
Jexxon,"Jan 22, 2005",4/10,"I'm not exactly a Chaplin fan, and perhaps that's part of why I didn't find The Great Dictator to be that good.The film feels too long to begin with. It's not a good thing when you sort of drift in and out of the film, suddenly realising that you weren't paying attention, and also realising that you didn't really miss anything. This almost always happened when the barber was on screen, rather than dictator Hynkel. I really didn't care for the melodramatic stuff, which is too much on the sappy side for my taste.The real joy of watching this movie comes from the crazed antics of Adenoid Hynkel. Things pick up pace every time he appears and Chaplin's satire take on Hitler is really good. In his scenes, the film lives up to its classic stature.The film feels very well made for its time, so I have no problem there either. The famous ending speech by Chaplin ruins a lot, though. It's all done with the best of intentions, but today it feels very naive and doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie. It's like Chaplin just ends the film with a propaganda speech, rather than to bring closure to the story. A more subtle approach towards getting out his message would have been much better. [4/10]"
rakibulalamdolon,"Apr 16, 2021",10/10,Charlie Chaplin was a visionary. The things that were about to happen in the future was portrayed in here very nicely. The final speech was phenomenal. Even if it's almost 80 years since the speech it's still applicable to humanity.
Doylenf,"Oct 1, 2002",N/A,"Since enough plot elements have been discussed in previous reviews, suffice it to say that although I enjoyed this legendary Chaplin film, it is by no means a masterpiece. It's slow in getting started and then becomes a series of heavy-handed vignettes about life in the ghetto contrasted with the life of The Great Dictator, giving Chaplin a chance to emote in high style as both the tramp-like Jewish barber and as Adenoid Hynkel. His funniest bits are of course whenever he does a brilliant piece of ""silent"" acting with gestures timed to the background music--notably in the barbershop scene where a nervous customer gets a close shave. Unfortunately, none of the dialogue is as brilliant as his use of pantomime.Indeed, there is a heavy handedness about much of the story's pace and direction. It almost seems as though Chaplin told his actors to play against his comedy by keeping a sober straight face uppermost in mind--watch how Henry Daniell and Reginald Gardiner play their parts with that stiff upper lip approach. An exception is Jack Oakie as Napaloni, doing a brilliant take-off on Mussolini. As a poor Jewish waif, Paulette Goddard shows all the vivaciousness that made her a star in subsequent films throughout the '40s. She adds warmth to all of her scenes with Chaplin.Some of the gags are carried on at too great a length, outlasting their comic value. And criticism can be made of some of the sequences played against fake scenery when obviously a good deal of money was spent on the main sets. The station scene featuring Napaloni's arrival is staged on an obviously fake studio set where the painted scenery stands out like a sore thumb. Jack Oakie got his only Supporting Role Oscar nomination for this one and Chaplin won a Best Actor nomination.Whatever the shortcomings, it does manage to keep afloat with some very amusing sequences. Chaplin deserves credit for even attempting such a satire--especially considering this was near the outbreak of the U.S. entry into war. His scene with the globe shows off his rare comic timing.A final note: the six minute speech at the end seems improbable coming from the timid Jewish barber and strikes a false note because it's so out of character. Obviously, Chaplin intended it to give the film a personal message of hope."
gbill-74877,"May 30, 2019",9/10,"Only Chaplin could deliver such a high level of humor and scathing satire in the same film, which was a beacon of light in a very dark time, and obviously on the right side of history. I love his humanity, courage, and vision in delivering this message at a time when America was wavering about entering WWII. There were lots of highlights:The on-point Hitler impression. Aside from the vocalization, throughout the movie we see Chaplin poking at the dictator's lack of intelligence, deep insecurity, and insane whims. There is also a steady stream of mockery of the Nazi war machine: the exaggerated march, overly vertical salute, inventions like the bullet-proof uniform and compact parachute, and plays on names, e.g. The ""Phooey"" instead of The Fuhrer, Herr Herring as Goring, Minister of War, Herr Garbitsch as Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda, etc.Hitler/Hynkel getting this advice, with the relevance to today's ugly turn in politics: ""I thought your reference to the Jews might have been more violent. We've got to rouse the people's anger. At this time, violence against the Jews might take the public's mind off its stomach."" And later: ""You might go a little further with the Jews - burn down some of their houses. A spectacular assault on their ghettos, now that might prove diverting.""The satire in the line ""Brunettes are trouble makers. They're worse than the Jews,"" and as the fascists dream about a blonde world, Herr Garbitsch slipping in that it would have ""a brunette dictator"", which of course was an irony of Hitler's Aryan ideal despite his own looks.The physical comedy, an example of which early on is in dropping a grenade down his sleeve as he tries to throw it, and later his understated reaction to finding out they're flying upside-down and out of gas. Later we see Hitler/Hynkel doing silly things like a ballet leap across the floor, followed by climbing the curtain and imitating Garbo's ""I want to be alone,"" and also knocking that balloon globe around with his behind.The Jewish barber being a veteran of WWI, and then also walking down the street in persona of The Tramp, both of which were reminders of the humanity of the Jewish people.Paulette Goddard's character saying ""Do you believe in God? I do! But, if there wasn't one, would you live any different? I wouldn't.""The shave to the music of Brahms (where Chuck Jones got the idea for the Bugs Bunny 'Rabbit of Seville' bit ten years later).Commander Schultz: ""Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people. Your policy is worse than a crime. It's a tragic blunder!""My God, that speech near the end. Absolutely stirring. The beginning of it is:""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish."""
blanche-2,"Feb 12, 2008",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin is ""The Great Dictator"" in this 1940 comedy-drama also starring Paulette Goddard, Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell and Billy Gilbert.Chaplin has the dual role of a Hitler-like dictator, Adenoid Hynkel (""Hail, Hynkel"") (all the countries are fictional, and the party logo is one X on top of another) and also a war veteran, a sweet barber who looks like Hynkel.There are some truly hilarious parts of this film as well as some truly dramatic ones. The barber trying to keep from falling out of a plane is just one; the nonsense German Hynkel speaks; the barber shaving one customer in time with the music, playing to Chaplin's silent film strengths; Hynkel's dancing with his world globe, which is really a huge balloon.The serious parts take place in the Jewish ghetto where the Jews are persecuted by Hynkel's men - Jew is written on the store fronts, and the soldiers are violent. In such stark contrast to the comedy, these scenes make a strong impression.The ghetto never knows what to expect - when Hynkel is trying to get a loan from a man named Epstein to attack and take over Osterlich, he has his soldiers lay off the Jews so as not to upset Epstein. Eventually the barber winds up in a concentration camp but escapes and is mistaken for Hynkel.Under Chaplin's direction, none of the film seems to be played for comedy. Hynkel himself is a buffoon, but he means it. The most amazing part of the film for me was the very end, when the Barber gives a speech as Hynkel. It's absolutely brilliant and very timely. The beautiful, radiant Goddard, looking at the sky, hope in her eyes, is not something I'll ever forget.Highly recommended. Made in 1940, the U. S. had not entered the war and Europe's problems were just beginning. Alas, the barber's speech wasn't reality."
Shilo_R_A,"Feb 22, 2022",6/10,"I mean, it's cute, but I really don't get the hype.The Great Dictator is a 1940 Charlie Chaplin and it follows two plotlines: the first follows a Jewish soldier (a barber, really, when there's no war) who suffers some kind of amnesia after getting injured in the front during WWI. The second plotline follows Hynkel (obviously a parody on Hitler), the crazy dictator of Tomainia, as he plans on world domination.Now, this is the first Chaplin film I've ever seen, and I'm honestly not sure if it didn't really click with me because you need some level of comfortability with Chaplin's vibe and humor and...maybe some subtle messages that went over my head? But anyway, here's my opinion as for now.I like some aspects of the humor here. Sometimes it's quite witty and fun (the double-cross thing is great, for instance), and sometimes the absurd, cartoon-ish humor works well. It is, though, a double-edged sword. When it works it's fun, when it doesn't it just feels dumb (for instance, most of the humor during the WWI sequence didn't really click with me).The cinematography, acting, dialogue...it's all okay, I guess. Nothing exceptional, nothing terrible.The emotional part feels a little half baked, probably since it really changes the tone of the film in a weird, almost forced way. I mean, the film does have some moments in which it tries to communicate some romantic chemistry or strong emotions between characters, but it's just kinda there. Not bad, not particulary good.So, yeah, I know that it was short this time, but I really don't have much to say here. Has some fun moments, has some tiresome moments, but it's a cute film overall. Its main strength is the humor and the satirical aspects (with Hynkel). Again, just cute, nothing beyond that. Feeling a 6.6/10 on."
LW-08854,"Dec 27, 2023",7/10,"A great film from Chaplin. While still employing a little slapstick this is still a much modern film in some ways. A fair bit of the comedy comes from the dialogue which is very sharp and funny at times. The film continually mocks the Nazis as both mindless thugs committed to a ridiculous ideology which is right for ridicule. Paulette Goddard is wonderful in this movie and conveys so well the warmth and goodness so missing in many of her fellow humans. The production history of this film was quite interesting, I think the film is not without it's flaws, the way in which Chaplin feels the need to literally tell the audience everything that is right and wrong when until that point the film had done a better job at showing us. The scene of the globe has become especially iconic."
funkyfry,"Oct 24, 2002",4/10,"This film starts off on a high note, with Chaplin returning to the ""little tramp"" form in sequences showing his bumbling attempts to help his fellow Germans win WWI, but the second half of the film degenerates amidst the not-so-soluble dual plotlines (involving, of course, star Chaplin in both plots) and pitiful verbal humor and ends on a note of unconvincing propaganda.  He plays both the Jewish barber and the leader of the Germans. There are some very witty moments in this latter role, such as his dance with with an inflated globe, but too much verbal ethnic humor (of the low vaudeville type) is not alleviated by a sufficient amount of slapstick violence.  Also, the plot's fluctuations between the two characters' stories becomes disconcerting and makes the film unfocused.  Goddard makes an unconvincing impoverished Jewess; she is a talented actress but she's wasted here as the object of mostly idealized romanticism.Chaplin's sincerity goes way past the breaking point of credulity in his final, ludicrously optimistic speech (yes, this one would put even Spencer Tracy to shame!).  This scene, which is played straight and has no humor whatsoever, ends the film on a sour, unconvincing note and does much to unhinge any satire that preceded it.An interesting failure at best."

RudeArtAndDesign_Com,"Sep 12, 2019",10/10,"I'll explain why you need to see the end at the end but, first a little about the rest of the movie:
A rarefied accomplishment, the pinnacle of the film-makers' art, a perfect movie. All of lifes' emotions all of what makes us uniquely human is touched upon throughout this film.Chaplin fights the Nazi ideologies of supremacy, racism and the dehumanization of the induvidual as a tool of the state with his own most powerful weapon, satire. I mentioned earlier the range of human emotions this film touches upon but, the lion's share you'll feel is joy, this above all is quite a funny movie.I could go on telling you more about ""The Great Dictator"" the acting, direction, sets, costumes ect (all tip-top btw) but, I just want to talk about the films' last 8 minutes. The title of my review asks you to (atleast) just watch the last 8 minutes, even if you don't like old movies (this is for you kids:-). I'm not going to review or comment about what you're going to see in the last 8 minutes of this film other than to say; First you'll hear from the Nazi and then Chaplin. Chaplin's soliloquy will move even the hardest....You know what, just watch the last 8 minutes. Personally I've never and probably will never hear a better speech about what it is to be truly human, it's truly timeless and a thing of eternal beauty"

thegreatnolanfan,"Apr 8, 2012",10/10,"The Great Dictator is a very well crafted movie. More than a movie Chaplin treated this project as a work of art and beautifully crafted it. I ve not seen his other movies but soon i will check out all of them. The characters are as interesting as the dialogues. There is never a dull moment in the movie. You cant help but notice the wit and intelligence involved in the script writing, as the minutes pass by, once you are into the movie. The comedy comes out as a breath of fresh air and not even close to being dated. Chaplin shows his greatness not only as a writer, director, actor but also a great human being. The final speech is by far one of the best speeches ever you will listen. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
Darth_Homer,"Oct 5, 2002",N/A,"When I first heard of The Great Dictator, I thought it was some stupid anti-war film. Well I recently saw it, and I regard it as being one of the best films ever. Chaplin does a excellent job as Hynkel and the barber, and the cast do they're roles perfectly. But the best bit in the film is by far the speech at the end of the film, the speech is so mezmerising it's possibly the best speech ever said in a movie. 10/10"
ofpsmith,"Oct 11, 2014",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin makes blatant fun of Adolf Hitler by parodying his Nazi Regime and expressing how he personally felt about it. Chaplin included aspects of anti-Semitism, and Hitler's invasion of Austria. Chaplin stars as two characters. Adenoid Hynkel the dictator of Tomania and an unnamed Jewish barber. There are also parodies of Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goring in Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) and Herring (Billy Gilbert). It also satirizes Benito Mussolini with a character named Benzino Napolani (Jack Oakie). The things I love most about this movie are the situations between Hynkel and the people that work for him. Because to me there is nothing funnier than a powerful guy who is a complete idiot. It's even funnier when you look at the fact that it represents Hitler. Chaplin is replacing a formidable leader, with a pathetic dweeb in the same role. Hynkel steals the show in every scene he's in. In particular the scene with Hynkel and the globe and the scene where Hynkel is giving a speech in fake German. Go check this one out."
sddavis63,"Feb 8, 2001",7/10,"Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, skewering Adolf Hitler.Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as  a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's spitting image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreels of Hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature.I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical Chaplin slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber. Having never seen it before I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what all the fuss was about. But the movie picks up steam quickly. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of ""Hynckel-ism"" to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.As good as Chaplin is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of ""Bacteria"" - ""Benzino Napaloni."" Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of ""Osterlich"" had me in stitches.This was a very good movie, and well worth watching."
tom-durham,"Dec 17, 2016",2/10,"What is very clear is that Charlie Chaplain is the master of silent films and slapstick humour. Unfortunately, this is not a silent film.Near the beginning there is a ~5-10 minute long 'joke' of a speech in garbled German-English words. I couldn't even make out what he is saying, the German-English jokes were not at all obvious, and so it was not funny and quite boring. If you manage to keep watching past this, you're doing well, it gets better but not by much.The small amount of classic charlie chaplain slapstick was mostly good and I laughed a few times at that, but unfortunately between the slapstick is tedious, unexciting dialogue.Maybe what Charlie Chaplain did was ground breaking at the time. Today, it fails to capture interest long enough to enjoy the comedic elements."
bigticket-36199,"Aug 26, 2025",9/10,"""The Great Dictator"" is a satirical war drama that parodies dictators and their politics in Europe at the end of the 1930s. It is also the first sound film in which the producer, director, screenwriter, and leading actor were all the same person - Charlie Chaplin.The story takes us to Tomainia, a state of the Central Powers. On the Western Front in 1918, a Tomainian soldier bravely saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz, who carries valuable documents that could secure victory for their country. However, their plane crashes after running out of fuel, and when soldiers find them, Schultz learns that Tomainia has capitulated to the Allied forces. The brave soldier has lost his memory. Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, he manages to leave the institution and return to his old trade as a barber in the ghetto. The ghetto is now controlled by Schultz, promoted in the Tomainian regime that has transformed into a dictatorship under the ruthless Adenoid Hynkel...Chaplin does not abandon his signature universal language of pantomime, but here, for the first time, he fully speaks with his voice. His camera reveals stark contrasts between the ghetto and the dictator's palace, while insisting on satirical depictions of both. He intertwines melodrama, political correctness, horror, loyalty, and humanity into a single satirical thread - and as a whole, it works seamlessly. Regardless of the political climate in the United States at the time, parodying Nazism was an extraordinarily courageous act.The dialogues are hilariously comic, at times bordering on black humor - undoubtedly Chaplin's intent. His satire in the lines is sharp, while the musical score reinforces the contrasts. His humor always hits the target, though that target is too terrifying for the audience to laugh without unease.The film questions many themes, sometimes subtly, sometimes through bold parody. Above all, it addresses the absurdity of power, visible in Hynkel's speech tirades, while the famous globe-balloon sequence is a subtle warning beneath its comic surface. The film also explores humanity itself through the characters in the ghetto: kindness, solidarity, love, hope, defiance, and dignity in the face of humiliation and violence. Yet there is irony here as well - the most humane character suffers from twenty years of amnesia.The final speech, though filled with love, hope, and reconciliation, comes across as slightly sentimental, even by the standards of the time.Charlie Chaplin's dual role as the Jewish barber and Adenoid Hynkel is a masterclass in contrast, a near-perfect balance of parody. As dictator, he amplifies every gesture to grotesque extremes, while as the barber, he emphasizes the poetic clumsiness of a gentle clown - the mirror of empathy and humanity. Paulette Goddard as Hannah embodies defiance and tenderness, carrying the dignity and fears of ordinary people. Her gaze at the barber deepens his ironic awkwardness, while adding warmth and a romantic thread to the story.Reginald Gardiner as Commander Schultz portrays a man torn between military honor and dictatorship. Through him, Chaplin parodies the contradictions of the system, despite Schultz's empathy and potential for redemption. Henry Daniell as Garbitsch represents the opposite - a humorless, cold, and dangerous figure, the stark reminder of the dark truth behind the satire. Jack Oakie as Benzino Napaloni is a boastful, gluttonous caricature of a dictator; his verbal and physical clashes with Hynkel are slapstick at its peak, revealing both men's utter incapacity for reason or dialogue.""The Great Dictator"" is a carefully crafted balance between political satire and social tragedy. Through humor and parody, Chaplin seeks to open our eyes to the deepest fears and horrors of his time. Sadly, it was already too late - and the greater tragedy is that, to this day, humanity has not learned much. This small masterpiece is a film every true lover of cinema should see."
ChristopherNolanfan437,"Apr 16, 2025",9/10,"Gosh, Chaplin knows how to make a comedy movie and make some parts of it powerful at the same time. Chaplin was ahead of his time. I love his mannerisms and the faces he makes. But what's more meaningful is how important this film must have been to bring awareness to how Hitler was treating the Jews and his hatred of them.The ending speech might be one of the greatest speeches in all of cinema, it's just so pure and truthful. I only had a few minor quibbles during the film, but if you haven't seen this film yet, you need to. It is truly a wonderful film and an important piece of cinema.9 out of 10 stars."
astro_pete,"Mar 13, 2003",N/A,"If you have not had the opportunity to see ""The Great Dictator,"" then rent it as soon as possible. As with any Chaplin film, the humor is timeless and unlike many movies, it can be re-viewed over and over. The passion and heart with which Chaplin exerts himself in this movie is fantastic, most especially in the end. While many a critic have said the monologue is out of place, it means so much more to me to be able to see somebody speak so passionately about something they genuinely feel. More so than any sound bridge, or deep focus shot, or visual match ever could."
jameslinton-75252,"May 10, 2016",7/10,"The Great Dictator is the third Charlie Chaplin film I've seen after Modern Times and City Lights. I also think it is the best Chaplin film I have seen. Chaplin portrayed his comedic talent in vocal, as well as visual comedy. At times, this film was hilarious. I was also surprised at the darker tone that the film took. Obviously since it is satirising the Holocaust, it is only expected that it will be dark, but still it took me by surprise. I also loved seeing Charlie Chaplin's more serious side. The speech ending the film is one of the greatest that I have ever seen. It is a brilliant speech.

johnnyboyz,"Jan 6, 2007",7/10,"Being quite a fan of Charlie Chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was eager to see 'The Great Dictator' as I had been told this was, arguably, his best film. I was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, Chaplin-wise.The start is typical Chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, Chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.Historically, the film got a few things right as well. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at Hitler's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. The 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there."
transylvanianfairy,"Jul 7, 2013",10/10,"The Great Dictator is a funny, charming and witty film, with excellent performances, especially from Charlie Chaplin and his wife, Paulette Goddard. But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed."
iamFilipp,"Aug 11, 2016",10/10,"The Great Dictator was by far the most direct cinematic manifestation of Chaplin's politics, which he had been exploring for decades in his silent comedies, but had been sharpened by his experiences touring the world in the early 1930s. His previous feature, Modern Times (1936), was his most ""political"" film to date, and in that masterpiece he demonstrated how fluidly he could merge the political and the comical, turning out a ""message movie"" that went down smoothly. The same is true for much of The Great Dictator, which is a frequently hilarious film that boldly uses caricature and satire to ridicule the leading despots of the early 20th century. Even many years later than it's first appearance on the screen this movie is more updated than ever! The totalitarianism and alienation of people are now a daily reality. Like their release of Modern Times last fall, Criterion has done fantastic work with The Great Dictator, giving us a new 2K high-definition transfer taken from a combination of a 35mm fine-grain master positive and a 35mm duplicate negative. Extensive digital restoration has removed virtually all signs of age and damage without losing the image's grain structure and film like appearance. All in all, there are no complains here, or even minor quibbles, for that matter. The image is sharp, well-detailed, and beautifully rendered in gray scale, with good black levels and excellent contrast. The monaural soundtrack, transferred at 24-bit from the sound negative and digitally restored, likewise gives the film a new lease on life. There are no cracks, pops, or ambient hiss, and the dialogue and sound effects are clear and precise."
bscrivener-50810,"Aug 20, 2016",9/10,"In his very first 'talkie' film. Charlie Chaplin proves as he did with his silent work to be impressive and inspirational in this now classic comedy/drama parodying the events leading up to and during the Second World War. The film opens with a Jewish soldier fighting on a fictionalised version of the Western Front for the nation of Tomania. After a near-fatal plane crash, the barber loses his memory and spends twenty years recovering in a hospital, during the same time his country and people are undergoing a radical revolution in the name of a new dictator named Adenoid Hynkel. Considered taboo and even downright dangerous at the time, The Great Dictator shows Chaplin to be more than just an outstanding actor and comedian, but a remorseful and courageous human being standing up to the real world troubles at the time and using his voice as a weapon. This is not just apparent in the beautiful and unifying speech that Chaplin delivers in the third act, but in his depiction of dictators and corrupt rulers. The film will have you laughing, cheering and even crying by the soul-touching finale, which challenges the very concept of human nature and the slow demise of mankind. While Chaplin may have come to pass, his legacy has well and truly lived on in what some consider his finest work. The only minor flaws are a lack of a real soundtrack that could have boosted the emotion, especially in the more serious scenes and some recurring gags that loose their comedic value by the end. 9/10"
PeterLind_,"Mar 31, 2019",9/10,I'm amazed that this movie came out only a year after 2nd world war began. It is brilliant and still relevant to this day. Charlie Chaplin playes his roles really good and the speech he makes at the end is just legendary still to this day.
gridoon,"Jul 25, 2001",7/10,"This must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; he throws in virtually everything, from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. The mixture is challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (like the one where Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together, and the mix (and tone) seem kind of disharmonious. As for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to ""a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality, and his soul will fly"".   Great perfornmances by Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard.     (***)"
stryker-5,"Aug 12, 2000",4/10,"Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania.  He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache.  Sound like anyone you know?From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini.  Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc,  Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name).  Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless.  All this does is to humanise him.  When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable.  As dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations which don't work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside.  In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic.  At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi.  Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer's face, ""your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people""?  And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto?  If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform?  Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age.  As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of 'silent' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line.  There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah.  Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage.  ""Gee, ain't I cute?"" she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over.  Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn't come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature.  The 'wouldn't it be wonderful?' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film's underlying weakness remains.  If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him?  And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?"
phobonnika,"Feb 11, 2014",10/10,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? Fictional dictator Adenoid Hynkel tries to expand his empire while a poor Jewish barber tries to avoid persecution from Hynkel's regime. We start the top 10 countdown with one of the eldest of the collection of all-time greats, a later day work of a director we all know and love more often than not for his charismatic and vaudeville performances on the screen rather than his blueprinting off it. Along with all great directors throughout history, Chaplin's greatest work is disputed to a short fallen conclusion. Notable for his consistent recurrence of the themes of strife of the downtrodden and 'good triumphs over evil' fables, The Great Dictator is, at face value, no exception. But the film's rich tapestry holds so much more to it than that, elevating it to a stance of assuming easily the role of not only Chaplin's greatest but one of history's greatest. One has to admire the bravery of Chaplin to produce such a touching, topical and quite frankly worldly historic piece of propaganda entertainment in 1940 for his loyal subjects: the distressed, the downtrodden and fed up allied population. It's piece of work that, as it rumbles into life, seems to be a misfit and muddled fledgling of a picture, soon turns into the greatest comedy ever made. Yet, astonishingly, after it assumes this role, it proves ever more versatile to the dumbfounded and subdued audience, showing a climactic bout of emotional power and vigour in the form of Chaplin's Dictator's famous dictatorial speech. The skill to represent both the weak and the powerful with his interchangeable portrayal of two characters, who take turns in being the mature and immature of the pair, ending on the prior mentioned sublime and bittersweet monologue of conflicting internal ideals of the satirised Hitler as a largely solo effort, just goes to show the untouchable echelons of what performance and direction working in harmony in the right place at the right time can be like. The Great Dictator is often said to be a weaker film amongst its competitors of the 1940s and 1930s, but cometh the hour of darkness: cometh the document of courage and faith with both humanist and more serious intent."
JoaoPovoaMarinheiro,"Jul 12, 2008",10/10,"Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. 'The Great Dictator' is a timeless masterpiece. Great success. It has all: comedy, smart plot, a strong message to humanity, and a critic to the tyrants and those who opposed for liberty and democracy (here Adenoid Hynkel/Adolf Hitler and Benzino Napaloni/Benito Mussolini), during the II World War.The performances are wonderful. Notably Charlie Chaplin. What a memorable performance by the actor. That 'clumsy' aspect, typical of Charlie Chaplin, that he gives to his characters works so well, even in some serious scenes of this film, like the last speech, where the barber is confused as Hynkel, and is about to sit and falls. But more funny scenes are present, such as when the barber is on the plane upside down with Shultz and all the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. Those scenes are hilarious and so clever. Charlie Chaplin was really fantastic in this movie. Funny when it had to be and even when it didn't had to be. Amazing.The plot is very smart, funny and entertaining during the entire movie. Despite a lot of comedy, I think that the scene when the barber, confused as Hynkel, has to make a speech, he sends such a powerful and influent message to all humanity, and was really touching. But, despite that, the movie is hilarious and such an excellent critic to the tyrants of the II World War, making them look ridiculous, specially the scene when Hynkel receives Napaloni and during their meeting, he tries to work on his superiority to the part of Napaloni but fails and never achieves it, like the scene when they go to the barber shop together and they play around with the seats. That was hilarious. Very smart screenplay written by Charlie Chaplin.A wonderful soundtrack also, just for the information.Timeless masterpiece, with entertainment guaranteed, 'The Great Dictator', is without a doubt one of the most remarkable movies ever made in the cinema industry, and teaches us a lesson also. A movie for all different kinds of ages. 10/10."
springfieldrental,"Jun 4, 2024",10/10,"Film studio owner producer Alexander Korda, a friend of Charlie Chaplin, told the comedian director he looked just like German leader Adolf Hitler. The comment planted a seed in Chaplin's head, inspiring him to create a satirical attack on the German chancellor, resulting in the classic October 1940 ""The Great Dictator,"" his biggest box office hit ever while it was an Academy Awards Best Picture nominee.Korda said it was a coincidence Chaplin and Hitler were born within a week of each other, they both rose up from poverty, they had the same physical build, and they both sported the distinctive toothbrush mustache. The son of Charlie Chaplin's wrote about the comparison between the two. ""Their destinies were poles apart,"" Charlie Chaplin Jr. Said. ""One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing. Dad could never think of Hitler without a shudder, half of horror, half of fascination. 'Just think,' he would say uneasily, 'he's the madman, I'm the comic. But it could have been the other way around.'"" After viewing Leni Risfenstahl's 1935's ""Triumph of the Will,"" a propaganda film on the Nazis' gathering in Nuremberg, Germany, Chaplin found comic possibilities in mimicking Hitler's gestures on the screen. Chaplin spent hours studying the Fuhrer's speaking style, which came in handy since ""The Great Dictator"" was Chaplin's first movie with sound dialogue.Chaplain wrapped his studio set around a shroud of total secrecy while filming ""The Great Dictator,"" making sure word didn't get out on his poking fun at the German leader. George Gyssling, the German consul who made a habit of threatening Hollywood studios to not criticize the Nazi government and its leaders, heard what Chaplin was doing. He wrote a letter to the head of the Hay's Office Joseph Breen protesting the ""burlesque' of Hitler by Chaplin. The timing of Gyssling's threat was perfect for Chaplin's pet project since it arrived on Breen's desk a week after Germany invaded Poland, setting off World War Two. What was discouraged by the censors a week before was now permissible, allowing Chaplin to mock the Nazi leader.Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, ""In 1940, this would have played as very highly charged, because Chaplin was launching his comic persona against Hitler in an attempt, largely successful, to ridicule him as a clown."" ""The Great Dictator"" contains two plots, both converging at the end. One featured the head of a fictitious European country Tomainia, whose leader Adenoid Hynkel (Chaplain) rules with an iron-clad hand comically seeking world domination, symbolically portrayed in the famous sequence of the dictator bouncing a gigantic global balloon in his office. The other storyline focuses on a Jewish barber (Chaplain), an injured World War One German veteran suffering amnesia for twenty years. Returning to his shop, he's confronted by storm troopers painting the word ""Jew"" on his shop's windows. He and his next door neighbor, Hannah (Paulette Goddard), are able to temporarily fend off the SS assaults. The Barber wears The Tramp's signature mustache and bowler hat, which film historians say was Chaplin's final appearance as his famous character. ""The Great Dictator's"" two arcs converge, leading to what critics say is one of the greatest monologues in film, spoken by the assumed Tomainian leader.The perfectionist Chaplin took an inordinate 539 days to film ""The Great Dictator."" He claimed when he wore the Nazi-type uniform it made him feel more aggressive. Those working close to Chaplin say he was more difficult to deal with when he was dressed as Hynkel. In addition, his relationship with Paulette Goddard was strained while directing his blockbuster; he was jealous she was receiving a number of lead offers for several big-budgeted movies. Goddard was unhappy with her small role in the film as well as the shoddy clothes and unkept hair style she was forced to wear. One nasty fight erupted when Chaplin harped on the way she was scrubbing the floor, claiming she didn't have ""the proper swing of the brush."" Goddard walked off after he demanded she clean the entire studio floor until she got the technique correct.Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" wasn't Hollywood's first satirical look at Hitler. The Three Stooges beat him by several months in January 1940's release of ""You Nazty Spy."" Germany and its allies banned the Chaplin film, but according to Hitler's girlfriend Eva Braun, Hitler did view Chaplin's movie twice and enjoyed the globe dance sequence. Hitler even remodeled his office to resemble the one in the film. Chaplin heard of the chancellor's viewing and declared, ""I'd give anything to know what he thought of it."" One theatre in Nazi-occupied Balkans packed with German soldiers contained resistance fighters switching reels in the middle of the movie it was playing to the ""The Great Dictator."" The stern soldiers began laughing at Chaplin's antics until they realized what was happening. While a few left others, angered by its content, shot their guns at the screen. When England's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain first heard about Chaplin's filming the Hitler satire in the summer of 1939, he declared the movie was against his appeasement policy, and would ban it from playing. When war was declared, the picture was allowed to be shown in the United Kingdom, to great popular demand.When he heard about the horrors of the Holocaust, Chaplin expressed regrets about making ""The Great Dictator,"" claiming if he ever knew the full extent of the Nazi's brutalization, he would have never made the movie. Controlling all rights to the film, he withdrew it from circulation in the middle of World War Two knowing its humor would be tough to amuse a war-weary audience. The film was shown in Rome in late 1944 shortly after Benito Mussolini high-tailed out the country, liberating Italy. Actor Jack Oakie's parody of the Italian dictator as the bumbling Benzino Napaloni had the Italians sitting in stunned silence after they previously laughed at the Hynkel scenes. Oakie later said he ""had made hundreds of pictures, but they only remember me as Napaloni."" When the movie reappeared in 1961, the Italians flocked to the theaters lapping up every minute of it. In Spain, ""The Great Dictator"" was withheld until 1975 when its dictator, General Francisco Franco, died.Film reviewer James Kendrick remarked Chaplin ""is certainly his bravest, if not one of the bravest films ever made. It was a lone cinematic cry for humanity to stand together against the ominous dark clouds of fascism that were rapidly spreading across Europe."" The Academy Awards nominated the film for five categories, including Best Picture (Chaplin's only Best Pic nominee), Best Actor (Chaplin's only nominated performance), Best Supporting Actor (Oakie), Best Original Screenplay (Chaplin), and Best Original Musical Score (Meredith Wilson), but didn't take home one Oscar. Chaplin is the only actor to refuse to accept the New York Film Critics award for Best Actor. The American Film Institute ranks his picture the 37th Funniest Movie of All Time."
jcullen_s,"Sep 8, 2019",10/10,This is the second best comedy movie about hitler with that new Jo Jo rabbit movie coming out soon I think is gonna be better this is pretty entertaining I really enjoy watching Chaplin and Buster Keaton even though it's not laugh out loud funny there really fun to watch and it's pretty cool Hitler actually watched this movie he obviously diddint like it but it's pretty amazing that Chaplin had the balls to make this movie and it's hilarious how great of a German accent he has in the film
blaackbird,"Mar 10, 2002",N/A,"It's not the most perfect film ever, it in fact has plenty of rough spots... but it's one of my favorites. There are parts that make you cringe and parts that are hysterically funny. Mel Brooks has said that one of his goals is to make people laugh at Adolf Hitler, believing that would show him up for what he really was. While it would be wrong to laugh at what happened then, it is true that many laughs were got at the expense of Hitler himself."
bostonianr,"Oct 3, 2023",7/10,"Written, produced, directed, and headlined by Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator (1940) is a satirical comedy, filled with audacious and controversial social and political commentary. Set during the beginning of World War II, and loosely based on Hitler's rule over Germany, Chaplin's first ever talking film certainly isn't his first political satire but is arguably the most conspicuous of all his films.The Great Dictator relays a story akin to the cruel and unjust treatment of the Jews under Hitler's rule through two different characters methodically described right out of the gate as having a strikingly resemblance: Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania, and the Jewish Barber from the ghetto. Chaplin's performance was truly unforgettable. The fighting spirit he depicted in his performance as the Barber effectively symbolizes Chaplin's position on fighting against social injustice, and the complete and utter fool that he depicted in his performance as Hynkel, served as a means of cautioning the audience against the threat of authoritarian leaderships on society.A self-proclaimed ""peace-monger"", there is no doubt in my mind that Chaplin's personal experience with poverty is what ignited his passion for social justice. Chaplin paved the way for the future of political comedy: To Be or Not to Be (1942), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), and Do the Right Thing (1989), to name a few. The way he used his auteur status and comedic ability as the medium to boldly portray his stance against the threat imposed by Germany and the unjust treatment of the Jews and achieve meaningful social change was truly brilliant. For those who appreciate slapstick humor, classic black and white pictures, and deep meaningful symbolism, I'd recommend seeing this film."
jamesjustice-92,"Apr 17, 2022",10/10,"Hasn't everyone ever wished for a better world, with no wars, poverty, unhappiness, with no prejudices, no crimes and no tears? I know I have. And so did Charles. He wanted to abolish everything that brought misery and pain into the lives of people and tried and made this world a little better with his presence and the work he had done.""The great dictator"" is his first completely sound feature film and the greatest satire on World War II and its instigator, Adolf Hitler. It's funny how the lives of two completely different people were twined together so closely: they were born a few days apart in April 1889, both went through poverty and were destined to become famous - only that one of them became famous for bringing so much laughter and joy to the world and the other did the opposite. The great power can be used both ways but only the power of good can create something worthy.Charles plays a dual role of the dictator and a Jewish barber who both look coincidentally identical but wish for radically different things. The barber's character is in a way a swan song to the role of Tramp Chaplin has been playing for the last 25 years; he has overgrown this character - he talks now, he walks differently, he even has bigger problems than the ones he used to have. Now he is ready to say loud and clear what he doesn't want the world to look like and by doing so in his passionate 3-minute monologue at the end of the movie he proclaims his views, beliefs and desires to us and hopes to reach out to us, not everybody but to those willing to hear and change, willing to fight for freedom, willing to follow our dreams, willing to be alive.""The great dictator"" is an unsurpassed gem of a movie, not because it bravely and brilliantly caricaturized the Nazis when the world was at war but because it showed how even one little man can make a difference. I know I said it so many times already but I love Charles Chaplin and with this movie he reached a new high in his outstanding filmography and made us hear with our own ears that he's got a lot more to say and give to the world."
Morten_5,"Apr 18, 2017",7/10,"Charles Chaplin was one of the first and one of the greatest actors directing himself. ""The Great Dictator"", which he also wrote, premiered in 1940 while Hitler was growing stronger and stronger in Europe. Looking back, it's hard to imagine a movie more current. Not surprisingly, it was banned in Germany until 1958. The speech in the end of movie has, rightly so, long since reached a level of immortality."
sgf-22593,"Mar 28, 2023",5/10,Chaplin's first full length talkie. I can see how it is historically interesting but does not travel well with age. It has some good members supporting cast like Henry Daniell and Paulette Goddard. I was never much of a fan of Charlie Chaplin. He was like Buster Keaton that relied on visual comedy before the age of sound. It drags at times especially when it is all sight gags just as in his silent films. Since it is listed as one of the top 250 on IMDB I figured I should watch it so that box has been checked. I thought the Stooges had a much funnier one about Hitler and I think it was released before this.
gavin6942,"Apr 6, 2010",8/10,"This is the story of a Jewish barber and another Gentile man who happen to look alike (both played by Charlie Chaplin). One grows up to become a ruthless dictator, the other feels the wrath of said dictator for being Jewish, despite his military service.Aside from being funny (which it is), the film really attacks Hitler and Nazi Germany in a very direct way -- there's no denying the target. And to do so in 1940 (or earlier, if you consider when filming started) was a bold move. America wasn't at war yet, and to my knowledge there wasn't a big outcry about the treatment of the Jews. So Chaplin was really ahead of his time here.The film was robbed at the Academy Awards, but that's typical... there's always some scandal there. Looking back, I think Chaplin won in the long run... this film stands as one of the greatest of all time, and has easily eclipsed that year's winner, Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" (which has failed to match the legacy of other films that year -- ""Grapes of Wrath"" and ""Philadelphia Story"")."
mchl88,"Feb 23, 2024",8/10,"Written, directed, produced and starring Charlie Chaplin, this is a BRILLIANT satire, parodying Hitler and the Germans as well as war itself.Chaplin plays two roles in this film, a Jewish barber (his usual ""tramp"" character) and Adenoid Hynkel, the great dictator of Tomainia. Chaplin is such a brilliant physical comic and some of the scenes here are surreal, like when he is tossing the balloon-like globe up in the air in his office. And the repeated gag between Hynkel and Benzino Napaloni (the Mussolini spoof) where they keep trying to salute each other then shake hands is so silly it's brilliant. The fact that their interaction ends in a food fight is just perfect.There are so many quick jokes in this movie you'll miss one while laughing at another. Every time Herr Garbitsch is introduced (sound it out) I laughed and then had to rewind to see what I'd missed. And by replacing the swastika with two crosses sets up the joke that calls Tomainias ""double-crossers.""Then, after all this silliness, the movie ends with a speech given by Chaplin as the barber who has been mistaken for Adenoid Hynkel. The speech is brilliant and uplifting; it's a much watch.I loved this movie!"
Sandcooler,"Feb 22, 2009",9/10,"This satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. But even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed as ""Hynkel"", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating that much I suppose. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. It's not even really the character talking anymore, it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era I suppose. This is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years."
Norinn,"Oct 10, 2004",8/10,"I think Charlie Chaplin is the bravest man in the world. Why? Facts about The great dictator that show that either Chaplin was a genius or just crazy.1.He was Jewish 2.Although he was Jewish he dared to make fun of Hitler 3.He did this when Hitler was more powerful than ever. 4.the name of the dictator was so similar to Adolf Hitler, everybody could notice it (Adenoyd Hynkel) 5.everything the Hynkel does and looks like is really similar to Hitler 6.Hitler threatened to kill him if he'd publish the movie but he still continued! 7. and so on and so onGet my point?"
behnamboogi,"Sep 26, 2025",6/10,"Perhaps the first thing that catches everyone's attention (including me) in this film is knowing the year the film was released, that is, when America had not yet officially entered World War II. Many films have been made about the events of World War II and Adolf Hitler, among which there are some outstanding works. But making a film with a comedic charge when everyone in Hollywood was silent was not possible for anyone other than Charlie Chaplin. Charlie, who was a legend of silent films at that time and although the technology of sound films had been used for more than 10 years, preferred to say his words with his silence. But finally, Charlie Chaplin's silence was broken in this film and for the first time, Charlie's voice was heard in front of the camera.Hitler and Chaplin: It is interesting to know that the similarities between these two are more than their mustache type! They were both born in the same week, month and year. Hitler was a refugee long before Chaplin became known as a ""fugitive"" (Charlie Chaplin's nickname). Both had left their countries to better understand the world, one becoming the most beloved and the other the most hated person of their time. In each country, Chaplin was a symbol of laughter and Hitler was a symbol of destruction.Watching Charlie Chaplin with his special, lovely style of movement is always a pleasure, especially since Chaplin himself was a professional musician and the music in his films perfectly harmonizes with his body movements. The music, like Chaplin's face, has a kind of bitter comedy or his nickname of ""fugitive""..."
planktonrules,"May 7, 2006",8/10,"This was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking film. Yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent film. So, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear Chaplin speak on film.The movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I enjoyed the film, I was not nearly as impressed by this as Chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. That's because I really felt annoyed by some of Chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played Adenoid Hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the Three Stooges). Plus, playing a funny Hitler is hard for me to take.However, when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The final speech by the barber (impersonating Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Watch the film for this reason alone."
gardnernrg,"Nov 17, 2020",7/10,"Charles Chaplin is an acclaimed silent film actor, but you would not be able to tell that from this film. There is plenty of speaking to go around, and it is done quite well for a man who mostly resided in silent films. From an entertainment aspect, the film is sometimes boring, but it is very funny. I did find myself chuckling quite often at what was going on, but overall the entertainment side was lacking. But these 7 stars come from everything else this film brings. At the time, the US had not yet entered WWII. However, 1940 is when Hitler was gaining traction, and his ideas and beliefs spreading throughout the world. This film is a direct parody of everything him and his regime stood for, and that is a BOLD move. Such blatantly obvious criticism of a political party and regime nowadays would seem almost inconceivable. But Chaplin did it. The speech that the Jewish Barber delivers at the end is perfect. I don't mean like, ""yea it's perfectly place"". I mean that every single word in that speech is perfect. The speech itself is quite pertinent in today's society as well - I'm writing this on November 17, 2020 - and stood the test of time for 80 years. A beautiful criticism of hatred and a wonderful plea for love and peace."
briancham1994,"Aug 10, 2020",5/10,This film is a letdown compared to Charlie Chaplin's other works. Perhaps it was insightful at the time but to me it came across as blunt. The speech at the end is inspirational to many but it just sounded trite and preachy to me.
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"May 23, 2013",9/10,"In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology.The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel.And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all.The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun.This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah).There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10"
evanston_dad,"Feb 14, 2006",10/10,"I know many people prefer Charlie Chaplin when he's silent, but I have to rank this as my favorite Chaplin film, sound and all. This is one of those movies chock full of one memorable scene after another: Chaplin's hapless soldier trying to load and fire a giant gun; his goofy dictator cavorting with an inflatable beach ball designed to look like a globe of the world; his gentle barber trying to give a member of the Gestapo a shave. I've heard that Chaplin was put on Hitler's death list as a result of this film; I don't know whether that's true or not, but if he was I'm not surprised. I can't even imagine the guts it took to make a film that so obviously mocked such a scary historical figure. In a time when comedians mock our world leaders left and right, it's easy to forget that there were times (and still places today) when doing so could get you killed.Without Chaplin's impassioned plea that closes the movie, in which he steps out of character and warns his audience directly about the consequences of ignoring the gathering storm of Nazi Germany (and fascism in general), ""The Great Dictator"" would be a marvelous comedy. With that plea, it becomes much more than merely a marvelous comedy; it becomes an important and inspiring historical document, that happens also to be pretty damn funny too.Grade: A+"
smirkinpigeon,"Oct 18, 2003",10/10,"There are a few films that are destined to be great, because they are challenging and daring. They are so because they challenge the times in which they are made. The highlights amongst these films are Kubrick's ""Dr Strangelove"" and ""The Great Dictator"", a film that everybody in Hollywood said nobody wanted to see. Thank god Chaplin made this film anyway.What Chaplin offers in this film and why it is so important as a historical piece today is an insight into the eccentricities of fascism that dogged the early 20th century. Chaplin and his actors masterfully copied the mannerism of the important figures of the time and then amplified and exaggerated them. We are therefore shown the Third Reich in all its dark and loony glory, in all its bloodthirsty expansionist policy and inhuman treatment of `sub-humans'.Chaplin's rendition of Hynkel is masterfully put forward as jibberish, with dramatic poses and movements that include him pouring water down his pants. The famous ballet with the globe was Chaplin's ultimate film moment that symbolizes just how reckless the Nazi expansion policy really was. However some of the most entertaining moments come from Napoloni, who visits Hynki' to discuss the invasion of Austerlitz by Tomania. A direct parody of the appeasement policy and the breaking of the Stresa front, Chaplin does not only have a go at Nazi Germany, but also at the people that just let it happen.Chaplin's final speech in which the Jewish barber takes the place of Hynkel, questioning Hitler's own Arianness, is filled with a plea to the world to stop war forever instead of simply saying that the world should stop the Nazis. This film should be compulsory in every country and in every school and the fact that the world is still embroiled in wars all over shows that this film is perhaps more relevant today than it was in 1940. When one looks at this film one can see, Robert Mugabe, Mohammed Al Caddaffi, Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush. Obviously we have not learnt the lesson yet!"
The Movie Buff,"Feb 28, 2002",10/10,"This movie is to WW2 what Dr strangelove is to the cold war.  It's hilarious yet still sends a meaningful message to the audience.  Chaplin's portrayal of Hitler is legendary.  This movie shows what the audience was missing all these years, the treat of having a Chaplin talkie.  This being his first talkie, it definitely lived up to, and exceeded its billing.  Through all the comedy and wise cracks that the movie is filled with, the message at the end that Chaplin gives makes it all worth while and brings tears to your eyes.  It makes me laugh that in his later years, people actually accused Chaplin of being a commie.  Just hearing the ending message should squash any of those beliefs.  Definite must see"
alexandra-25,"Feb 8, 2008",N/A,"The film, The Great Dictator is one that permits Chaplin to quote (some might say misquote) Garbo's famous line; ""I want to be alone"" from the film, Grand Hotel (1932), when his character is conceiving his world domination, just prior to dancing with an inflatable globe, symbolic of fallible power, in a vulnerable world at the time. In this way, Chaplin is paying homage to Garbo in an ironic sense. As technological advances permitted 'cinematic sound' which was promoted via Garbo for the advertisement of Anna Christie (1930) with the line: ""Garbo Talks"", so in The Great Dictator, Chaplin talks.But Chaplin utilises the medium of sound for his own political bias. It is widely believed that Chaplin's political bias as being sympathetic to communism. (But as Chaplin admitted himself he was somewhat naive of the unknown as illustrated via his satirising of antisemitism in The Great Dictator). This has been seriously misconceived and confused with Chaplin's real political bias which was his concerns with capitalism in its 'free market' model. The pitfalls, (i.e. its precarious nature) of the free market model of capitalism, lacking in social welfare provisions emerging from 19th Century industrialism culminated in illiberal ideals. Illiberal idealism is the core tenant of fascist ideology as defined by Sicillian born philosopher Giovanni Gentile (May 30, 1875 - April 15, 1944) as a means to legitimate the Italian model of fascism for dictator Benito Mussolini, (July 29, 1883  April 28, 1945) . However, Illiberal ideals as Chaplin suggests in The Great Dictator become a destructive force on freedom, as illustrated in both fascism and Communism.It is documented that Hitler watched The Great Dictator, which it is rumoured touched his alleged sense of humour. Maybe Hitler being the megalomaniac he was misunderstood the film as a homage to himself, and an inspiration to his cause.The opening set of the film exhibit Chaplin's genius as he gives a histrionic and gradual build up to an anti-climatic scene of a lapsed bomb. Likewise his genius is further illustrated this time in his comedic dexterity and timing in the aspects of the film which give way to the 'silent' genre. This said, the overall, general genius of Sir Charles Chaplin is the way he made tragedy comedic in his own unique way, which induce the viewer to look at their own conscience as witnessed via the antisemitic scenes in the The Great Dictator.The supporting cast are excellent. This is due to Chaplin's perfectionism as a director. Such perfectionism contributed to Paulette Goddard's great acting ability as illustrated in The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946).In conclusion this film is a sombre caveat of the dangers the instability a free market economy lacking in social welfare provisions has for potential and ultimate consequences of society."
antiwolf,"Aug 22, 2001",10/10,"It is a very funny movie, but it is by no means just light entertainment. The comedy got people to pay attention to a message that they might have ignored otherwise.A the time, many people though that he treatment of Jews in Germany couldn't be as bad as was depicted in the film, but if anything, this movie is mild compared to the real thing.It's important to remember that this movie was made when the US was fairly anti-semitic.The movie was also contreversial because it didn't just take on Naziism, but oppression wherever it occurred.  The final speech is about more than Naziism."
wekirch,"May 5, 2021",6/10,"An overrated film. The satire works very well, especially since Chaplin has sussed that Hynkel-Hitler was the empty puppet of his impulses. But Chaplin can't resist inserting slapstick and farce, which interferes with the developing terror. The Brown Shirts may have been buffoons, but their buffoonery killed people. Chaplin shies away from following the logic of his plot to its dark conclusion. The final scene, obviously meant to be a stirring call to arms against tyranny, turns the plot into sentimental farce. Satire is allied to tragedy, and doesn't need a happy ending to make its point. But perhaps the American audiences of 1940 preferred to laugh at slapdash tyrant instead of considering the moral imperative laid on them by recognising evil.I watched this movie because of its reputation. It's become a curio, important for its historical significance. It did help mobilise American opinion against Hitler. But it's also an example of the muddled mess that Chaplin was capable of producing when not restrained by a strong director. A mixture of inspired satire, slapstick, and comedy, but that's all, a mixture. The movie doesn't have the structure that I expected. It's a series of set pieces loosely strung on an underdeveloped plot line. Too often, I got the impression that Chaplin was showing off, or relying on his audience recognising a shtick he'd used many, many times before.Worth watching if you're a Chaplin fan, or if you want to understand how old movies coudl affect public opinion."
niaz_islam,"Aug 8, 2017",3/10,"Undoubtedly this is not Charles Chaplin's best work. This guy is a legend but sadly his performance in this film was not nowhere near legendary.The story was not well written and lacked quality humor in it. Some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and dull. If the film's run time was one and half hour long then the film would have been more enjoyable.Charles Chaplin's performance was good but it was not his usual excellent work. I think the script failed him badly. Because the story didn't stick to the character all the time, sometimes it went off the character and did something which does not fit the character they build up.All in all it is a good movie but does not deserve this much high ratings."
car-nune,"Oct 4, 2004",10/10,"Chaplin is greatly amusing in this extraordinary film. The acting is superb, as well as the jokes which are definitively hilarious. For those who have read the extense biography on Hitler by Ian Kershaw or Allan Bullock's mesmerizing book, this impersonation of Hitler is adequate. The parody of the strong, guttural German accent, and Hitler's gestures when lecturing on hatred and repression, is very similar to reality. In fact, the scene with Adenoid Hynkel playing with a balloon that resembles the Earth, is not far from historical evidence. Hitler was the world's most extravagant megalomaniac, a feature which Chaplin obviously caught a glimpse of. Finally, I highly recommend this film for cinema fans and people who simply seek a funny, yet profound movie."
MattBrady099,"Sep 28, 2014",10/10,"The Great Dictator is about a poor barber is confused with the great Nazi dictator and is sent into his place, unknown to the dictator. When I look at comedy's today I see good work and overall a good comedy. But it will never be like Charles Chaplin the great dictator.

The globe scene, the train scene and the speech at the end which made me cry because how true it is and how much we need it to make the world a better place. Overall the great dictator is outstanding movie with a great story and a brilliant speech.Quote from Dictator of Tomania: ""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"
The Lowpriest,"Nov 2, 2001",10/10,"This movie was years ahead of it's time.  Chaplin was a master as both director and actor.  To take on a persona such as Hitler while Hitler was at the height of his power was without equal.  As far as I am concerned, Chaplin sealed his fate as the top of the movie world with this film."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 13, 2023",8/10,"Hynkel, The Great Dictator has risen to power, unknown to him he has a doppelganger, in the form of a Jewish barber, the realisation causes some problems for both.Quite a daring film, and though The Dictator is known as Hynkel, it's clear the film is referencing Hitler, other prominent Nazis will also be recognised here.1940, and the world was definitely changing, Hitler was rising to power, and would soon change the whole continent of Europe, and audiences were more used to talking pictures, could Charlie Chaplin's first effort hit the mark?The answer is yes, it has quite a profound anti fascist message, it needled Hitler so much that the film was naturally banned, and Chaplin's name was added to Hitler's hit list.Chaplin is incredible in his dual roles, he adapted incredibly well to starring in a talkie, there is a stark contrast in the two characters, he is so impressive. That closing speech is quite something.It is funny, but unlike some of the earlier Chaplin films, I found some of the slapstick moments appeared a little staged, and overall it perhaps lacked some of the naivety and innocence of the earlier films.If I'm truly honest, it isn't my favourite Charlie Chaplin movie, but I'd still regard it as a classic piece of cinema, and I'd definitely say that it is a must watch for all film lovers.The film's eternal popularity doesn't surprise me one bit.8/10."
ssaimeri,"Jul 7, 2015",8/10,"A movie that transcends generations and yet is particular to it's own. Conceived in a time just before some of the most acclaimed atrocities of human history it encapsulates a wonderful, modernistic mentality. A mentality that says it is sometimes necessary to make light of a dark character, so that people may pierce through the veil that shrouds the man in mystery, awe and fear. And this is something that Mr. Charlie Chaplin does exceptionally well while at the same time making us chuckle at his natural slapstick humor that he brings to all of his pictures. This movie is one of the most important in film history and not only because it set the precedent for future film makers. It is important because it promotes an ideal outside of its time. One of equality and of acceptance. Bravo Mr. Chaplin"
bob the moo,"Jun 15, 2008",N/A,"During the first world war, a clumsy Jewish soldier saves the life of career soldier Schultz but in the process loses his memory. Many years later he recovers and returns to his barber shop but the country of Tomania has changed from what he would remember (if he could remember it). The Dictator Adenoid Hynkel has laid claim to the country and is mercilessly persecuting the Jewish people. While Hynkel continues his political persecutions (which will next extend to brunettes), the unassuming barber finds himself in the midst of a form of resistance movement.Although it is considered a classic, I had never actually seen this film. At the end of a week where I had not only seen Little Man but also Norbit, I felt like perhaps my film-watching choices were not the best I could be making and decided to come to this next. I don't normally like to step into context when watching a film because my enjoyment of it (or not) is based on a modern viewing, but with Great Dictator it is important to note that Chaplin did not decide to do this film in the political climate that we now associate with Hitler and the Nazi party. At the time production started even Britain was not at war with Germany. So one does have to appreciate the career risks that Chaplin was taking by mocking an European leader so far from America. Of course time quickly showed his instincts to be correct and the film has lost none of its relevance.Being his first all sound talky, I was impressed by how Chaplin does so well with the comedy from the dialogue as well as the physical side. The film is very funny although it should be noted that those expecting the quick-fire of gags associated with his best silent shorts will be a touch disappointed because it is more of a ""proper"" film with a plot and events rather than just setups for jokes. In regards the plotting, it is not always as effective as it could have been but this is understandable with the nature of the film. This is best seen in the concluding speech, which in regards plotting is not a great ending but in terms of using the film to make an impassioned plea to the world, it is hard to criticise. As an actor Chaplin does surprisingly well as the barber, with a real sense of pain and longing in his turn. As Hynkel, he is funnier but not as smart in the style of comedy. The supporting cast is mostly very good. I was very impressed by Goddard's performance but of course my favourite one was Jack Oakie's wonderful Napaloni.The Great Dictator is undoubtedly a film of significance in regards cinema history but this does not mean that it is not interesting and funny at the same time. The nature of it means that it is neither as strong a story nor as funny as one would hope but as a total package it is hard to fault. There are funnier Chaplin films from earlier in his career but this is one definitely worth seeing."
akshatmahajan,"Jan 3, 2023",6/10,"Charlie Chaplin was good with black comedy and this one was a decent example of it. I previously watched Modern Times which was satire on industrial revolution and this one was satire on Adolf Hitler. The attempt of making this topic as a satire was good but I felt that the movie was loose at some points. The execution could have been little bit more tight but overall the experience of watching it was good. Yes, the movie was not great but it was fun watching as it entertains you.Overall, it was a good comedy satire and will make you laugh at some scenes and the final speech still feels strong when you hear it."
podunko,"Feb 12, 2019",10/10,"I must say that I was never into silent films for the most part,and for that reason Charlie Chaplin was never much on my radar. Well after screening this amazing film which he wrote, directed, and starred (twice), what can you say. CC was an amazing individual and I am planning to catch up on his life and works. And yes, during some of Hynkel's speeches, it appears our current fear mongering leader took some of them verbatim. 79 years ago, shall we ever learn..."
michael-1151,"Mar 15, 2008",7/10,"""In this land of the crazy the sane are mad"", wrote Edmund Cooper. This 1940 Chaplin classic is as great an example of that phenomenon as you will find. Yes, it is indeed strange that Chaplin's Adenoid Hynkel should pull spaghetti apart in frustration, whilst arguing with his dictatorial rival in the shape of Jack Oakie's Napoloni; but how much stranger, darker and ultimately madder were the hatreds engendered, crimes committed and murders perpetrated during the run up to, and through the course of, WW2? A satire has to contain recognisable human characteristics, instincts and foibles - when this was made it was known how bad Nazism was, but not the extent of the persecution, death camps and ethnic cleansing. A quite extraordinary line in the film about the discovery of a wonder poison gas, acutely and poignantly envisages the ultimate madness, the gas chambers.The delightful scene in which Hynkel plays footie with an inflated globe, bouncing it twice on his buttocks, before finding it burst in his grasp, is a great metaphor for Hitler's megalomania; and the touching Paulette Goddard, who plays Hannah, is both willing to take on the stormtroopers and go out with an amnesia suffering, older Jewish barber, living below her parents rooms - boy, if I could achieve such social success, I'd grab the scissors right now and forget all things good, bad or indifferent beforehand.Chaplin's final soliloquy may be deemed somewhat pretentious, but his condemnation of anti-semitism and call for racial tolerance amongst black and white, all classes, races and creeds, should be pinned to the wall of every UN representative's office, right now. 21st Century audiences can learn as much from this film as 20th Century ones. Hynkel and Napoloni may be buffoons, but this acerbic classic is as potent now as it was then. Buffoonery can sometimes, just sometimes, be evil."
Bernie4444,"Aug 9, 2024",4/10,"""The soul of man has been given wings""This movie is hyped up causing some sort of frenzy; someone calls it a classic or likes the thought that someone is mocked, and the next person repeats it until everyone gives this less than mediocre film a positive spin when reviewing it.This is Chaplin way past his prime still trying to be a Keystone Cop and using mundane slapstick humor years after the film industry became more sophisticated. From the first scene you ask, ""This is a top-star movie?"" and it goes downhill from there. The sets are cardboard, and the camera is pretty much still.If you like films that mock the era a much better production was rendered by Jack Benny and Carole Lombard inTo Be or Not to Be (1942).The basic story is of a dictator and a barber ""that is not all there"" getting their Identities crossed. Chaplin gets to play both parts. The only redeeming value of the movie is the acting of Henry Daniell who played Garbitsch. Then again, he is a veteran actor and can be seen in over 60 films includingThe Woman in Green (1945)as Prof. Moriarty.All the people are exaggerated stereotypes (maybe on purpose) and this distracts from the story like having a musical with songs not related to the movie.If you can make it to the end of the film, you get a long tedious speech in the style ofAyn Randhowever not quite as good. ""The sun shines and the wind blows."""
shivbrxt,"Dec 15, 2019",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin did great, i always wanna see his movies, listened a lot about him and about his great work.

jack_o_hasanov,"Aug 2, 2021",9/10,Chaplin has made a beautiful and thought-provoking film as always.
scarletpumpernickel,"Jan 5, 2021",9/10,"In 1940.. this film had one message.
But in 2021 it could have a very different one.
It was first seen as a brave movie.., which, in light of the focus on Nazi imperialism, was seen as a call for a more peaceful world -- a more perfect world.
But if you pay close attention to Chaplain's final speech, his portrait of this perfect world, includes the ""elimination"" of national boundaries"".. which could be seen as the anthem of the globalists.Unfortunately, in the intervening years since it was made.. globalism holds a much different meaning than it did for the naive audiences of 1940.
With an uncertain amalgam of everything from the perpetual technocrats and various power mongers.. to the corporations and those whose motives are simply money..,
the goal, espoused by Chaplain, in creating a peaceful world with Unity is its hymn.. has mutated into the somber drum beat of a ""Brave New World""?"
jinter-71217,"Oct 2, 2024",10/10,"The Great Dictator is a 1940's American film written, directed, produced, scored, and starring Charlie Chaplin. It was his first full length feature that included sound. Due to the satirical anti-fascist subject of the film, he was advised not to move forward with its production. However, that didn't stop him as he knew the message he was trying to send was far greater. This film then went on to be his most commercially successful film. One that is still considered to be one of the greatest comedy films ever made.In the film Chaplin plays the role of a Jewish barber and Adenoid Hynkel, a dictator ruler of the country of Tomania. The movie starts off with Charlie as a Jewish soldier fighting in the war. He ends up saving the life of a wounded pilot but due to the fuel running out of the plane, the two crash and Charlie suffers from memory loss. The movie then fast forwards 20 years to where Charlie still suffers from amnesia but decides to return to his previous life as a barber. It is once he returns to his old town that things begin to stir up. He falls in love, gets into trouble with the antisemitic stormtroopers and runs into the pilot he saved at the beginning of the film. All the while we also flash over to Hynkel's perspective who is busy trying to grow and finance his military services and continue his conquests.Charlie Chaplin was able to balance such a heavy topic with his comedy. This film contained plenty of subtle humor but also threw in some slapstick to keep things light. An example can be found at the beginning of the film when he was loading up the cannon but the missile backfires and as he goes to inspect it, the missile starts to spark and twirl as it ultimately explodes. He also continues to highlight the absurdities of dictatorship throughout the film. One of the most memorable parts of this film ends up being the final speech that the barber ends up giving as he is impersonating Hynkel. In this way I can connect 'The Great Dictator"" with Spike Lee's film 'Do the Right Thing.' Both movies contain impassioned closing speeches. 'The Great Dictator's' speech is one for unity and kindness and 'Do the Right Thing' challenges viewers to reflect on how to address violence & racial injustice (through the points of MLK and Malcolm x). Despite being vastly different and roughly 40 years apart, both manage to address social issues and advocate for empathy.From what I gathered during my research; Chaplin spent months writing up his final speech for the end of his film. Though not well received by everyone, his speech can still be viewed as relevant today despite being made in 1940. I think it says a lot about this film that it can still resonate after all these years. Which is as disappointing as it is impressive that the messaging is still something we need to be concerned about. Overall, this movie caught me off guard. I cannot say that I had ever viewed any other movies that Charlie Chaplin was a part of (both before and after talkies). But I learned a lot about him through the viewing of this film. I personally found his persistence in putting out this movie to be quite touching."
Billy_Boy_,"Sep 5, 2025",8/10,"The Great Dictator definitely is Charlie Chaplin at his most daring and serious (while also still managing to be witty and funny of course), mixing satire, slapstick, and genuine emotion in a way that still feels powerful today. His parody of authoritarianism is sharp and often hilarious, but what really surprised me was how heartfelt and moving it is, especially in that iconic closing speech.Not every gag lands, and at times the pacing drags a bit (the movie definitely could have been a bit shorter), but overall it's a remarkable mix of comedy and conviction. Chaplin manages to be both silly and sincere, delivering one of his most memorable and unique films."
Voodoo Daddy,"Feb 3, 2000",N/A,"Charles Chaplin was never funnier than in this movie, his first ""talkie"" of all time.  Charlie made great use of these new fangled talking movies, but he still had the great physical comedy which made him famous with his hundreds of silent films. While this movie is great as a comedy, it is even better politicly.  Anybody watching this movie should realize that it was made in 1940, so the Nazi party had yet to be uncovered for what we see it as today.  Because of this, Chaplin's views were way ahead of their time, and in a way, he was taking a serious risk standing up for the millions of Jews that were being persecuted during this time. In short, this film is the best example of satire humor I can think of.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially for someone that knows anything about Nazi Germany, Hitler, or the Holocaust.  I would also recommend it for classroom use for students studying the WWII period.  One final thought: To anyone who plans to watch this for the first time, pay special attention to Chaplin's speech towards the end of the movie.  I think if Adolf Hitler had sat through the whole movie and saw that speech, even he could be converted to a humanitarian.  Cheers!"
alekspredator87,"Aug 23, 2023",7/10,"The film ""The Great Dictator"", released in 1940, remains one of the most significant works in the history of cinema. The great Charlie Chaplin, who played the main role and also acted as a director and screenwriter, created not only a masterful comedy, but also an amazing political satire, imbued with deep social and moral reflections.Chaplin, like no one else, managed to penetrate into the essence of Hitler's regime and perfectly understand the threat that Nazism carried. In his film, he presented not only a satirical copy of the dictator, but also touched on issues of freedom, democracy, equality and human dignity. With his extraordinary vision and insight, Chaplin warned the world against tragedies that could happen (and did, the Second World War had already begun in 1939) if we were not vigilant and ready to resist evil.Chaplin perfectly fit into the role of both characters - a Jewish hairdresser and Fuhrer Adolf Hinkel. With his magnificent performance, the actor allowed the audience to understand the difference between good and evil, between true humanity and indifference. His inimitable mimic art and bodily expression created images that still cause laughter and sink into the soul.The visual performance of the film is admirable: the images and compositions of the frames, the use of light and shadows, all this serves both emphasized irony and deep philosophical intent. Chaplin boldly plays on the emotions of the viewer, showing the painful reality, but without losing hope and faith in humanity.""The Great Dictator"" is now not only a film about the past, it is also a warning about the possible future, about what can happen if we do not learn to respect and appreciate each other. Chaplin raises things that remain relevant today - the problems of inequality, political abuse and imprisonment.The movie is good. Obviously not a masterpiece, as for me, but five Oscar nominations speak of its obvious significance for cinema and for all generations. He entertains with his comedic essence, encourages you to think and find the strength to fight for truth and freedom.7 out of 10."
Falko_h1,"Jul 5, 2024",5/10,"""The Great Dictator,"" directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, is a bold satirical film that tackles the rise of fascism and the tyranny of dictators. Released in 1940, the film is notable for its daring commentary on Adolf Hitler and the political climate of the time.Chaplin plays dual roles: a Jewish barber and Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomainia. The film's strength lies in its comedic moments and Chaplin's ability to blend humor with poignant social commentary. The slapstick humor, combined with sharp satire, delivers a unique cinematic experience.However, despite its historical significance and moments of brilliance, the film can feel uneven. Some of the comedic sequences, while classic Chaplin, may seem dated and less impactful to modern audiences. The pacing can be slow, and the transition between comedic and serious tones sometimes feels jarring.The movie's climax, featuring Chaplin's famous speech, is powerful and resonates with a message of hope and humanity. Overall, ""The Great Dictator"" is a significant film, but its execution may not fully engage all viewers, leading to a mixed reception."
owensheekey,"Aug 27, 2024",8/10,"I viewed Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) after viewing his best silent film Modern Times (1936). The Great Dictator is his best ""Talkie"" film. This is my first awareness of his transitioning successfully from the silent to the talkie era of films. His role was writer, director, and main character for both films.The Great Dictator is a somber depiction of Nazi Germany at the start of World War 2. As such it takes away from the comedic aspect of the film. There are still occasional scenes of silent slapstick humor. Absent is the maniacal cadence of the silent film. One can say this film is ""Much Talk but Little Action"".Nevertheless, it introduces the audience of the time to the horrors of fascism, accumulating in Europe, without the grim histrionic and hyperbolic verbosity of newspapers. There is no blood and guts to frighten the audience. The veiling by humor softens the introduction to the dark reality enveloping the viewers. Labeling this simply as a comedy is incomplete. It is a soft look at a social event evolving into the most destructive war in human history. It was a gentle view into a future apocalyptical curse of misery and despair flung on the people of the economically developed world by a small group of nefarious criminals.Charles Chaplin presented an awful reality to 1940 viewers in such a way that they might tolerate the truth without prematurely turning away in horror. As such the film avoided outright censorship within the free world but not the autocratic world. The film's essence is a call for freedom over tyranny."

BrodyMoazzeni,"Aug 5, 2025",10/10,"..this movie has been done when Hitler ( and Mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the Roman Church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in USA there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in Germany and Europe ( Charles Lindenbergh for example ). It would be as today a big actor would made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life, but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration he was a courageous man. The movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever done."
Yohghurt,"Jul 26, 2025",10/10,"One of the best films I've ever seen. It's funny, brave, and still feels so relevant today. Charlie didn't just make a movie he made a bold statement, at a time when not many people had the courage to speak up.The comedy is clever and sharp. The silly moments, the over-the-top gestures, the ridiculous props they all had a purpose. You laugh, but you also realize he's making fun of something dark and dangerous. His way of copying and mocking the dictator character was just brilliant. It takes real talent to be that funny and that meaningful at the same time.And the final speech? Wow. It gave me goosebumps. It's one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched. Even though the film is old, his words still speak to everything we're going through now about kindness, peace, and standing together.It's more than just a movie it's a message. Honest, emotional, and way ahead of its time. He didn't just entertain he made people think. That's what makes this film unforgettable.If you haven't seen it, you really should. It's a classic for a reason."
ALZZ107,"May 30, 2004",N/A,"Though some may not agree with my opinion on this unbelievably marvelous and ingenious film, I still stand by my belief that this is undoubtedly one of Charlie Chaplin's greatest films. By portraying two characters (that of a dictator and a Jewish barber), many with one track minds do not understand the marvelous intellect behind the dual characters. Chaplin depicts these characters to show the different perspectives of each individual. It's a simple plot, not meant to be perplexing and lead to confusion, which many have said it has done. The artistic value of Chaplin's characters are priceless and the speech at the end of the film is beyond awe-inspiring and would make Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech look like that of a 4th graders book report. The speech leaves you on a hopeful and motivational note, even in this era. I can only imagine the feelings of the people who viewed this film in 1940 when it first came out into theaters. It gave them the belief that maybe, just maybe, there was still hope in the world and that it could be saved from this feared and power hungry dictator.This film reflects Chaplin's beliefs and his bravery. He did not fear Hitler, and showed others that they shouldn't fear him either. I'm sorry if I have offended anyone in this commentary. I do not mean to offend, I only mean to express my opinion and reveal what others might not have understood about this wonderful film."
gulsumbertug,"Dec 7, 2023",7/10,"I just had the opportunity to watch ""The Great Dictator"", which I have been wanting to watch for years. Although I didn't come across a masterpiece as I expected, I liked the movie. ""The Great Dictator"" is obviously a ""conscience movie"" that comes out of the brain and heart of a conscientious man. 2 Yet. By signing such a film during the years of the World War II, Chaplin once again proved to me how conscientious, kind-hearted a person he was (I already felt this in the film ""Modern Times"", one of the first films of the Master that I watched). I found the drama aspect of the film more successful than the comedy aspect. I actually thought the opposite would happen. If it was a completely drama-heavy movie, I think we would have watched a superior work. Chaplin's acting is also really incredibly successful. I watched two such different characters throughout the film as if they were being played by two other actors. I recommend that everyone watch one of these important films in the history of cinema. The lessons to be learned from the film will not end throughout history because."

I did not laugh once. This movie has very basic morals which everyone understands and the simplistic story is not interesting at all. There's nothing good about this film."
classicalsteve,"Jul 17, 2011",10/10,"Most of Chaplin's silent film efforts were whimsical slap-stick comedies with slight undertones of social satire: booting the rear of an immigrant official, escaping the clutches of fool-hardy police, or being trapped inside a mechanized factory. The Tramp, the first iconic figure of the new medium of film/cinema, was the nameless but lovable immigrant, not knowing quite where he fit in. Always on the periphery of the establishment but ultimately of a kindly and innocent nature, the Tramp was endeared by audiences across America and Europe. For those coming to Ellis Island for the first time to forge new lives in a America, Chaplin's comedy probably reflected their grappling with this alien world. But on the surface, the main point was always entertainment, mostly comedic and occasionally sentimental but never biting. And then, Chaplin fused both comedy and political/social commentary into a film which really does make quite a political point.The Great Dictator is one of the best mingling of social satire and comedy, a brilliant and effective combination of entertainment and commentary to ridicule fascism which had taken over Germany and Italy. The Tramp or nameless barber is a private at the very end of World War I fighting for the fictional country of Tomainia. He along with a pilot escapes from the front lines, crashing in a plane, luckily just in time for the Armistice. But the Tramp is hospitalized for 20 years, and he suffers memory loss, and doesn't know the country is under new leadership.His country has put their faith in a new leader, Adenoid Hynkel, who looks one helluva lot like a cross between Adolph Hitler and Charlie Chaplin. In this country, Jews are being targeted. After leaving the hospital, the Tramp returns to his barber shop. He is immediately assaulted by policeman in helmets with armbands with crosses. A scuffle and chase ensues in typical Chaplin fashion, with lots of running around and a head being banged more than once, the service being provided by a woman in an upper window. As he navigates down the streets while evading authorities, he sees the word ""JEW"" written in bold letters on shops and windows.Eventually the film cuts to behind-the-scenes of Adenoid Hynkel, the new Great Leader of Tomainia. My favorite aspect of this film is the portrayal of the Leader/Dictator. He's pompous, arrogant, and vain, so exaggerated he would give Stalin and Hitler a run for their money, or would he? He has a military officer lick his envelope, and is simultaneously having his portrait painted and his bust sculpted. He ceases persecution of the Jews, not out of moral indignation, but he wants to borrow money from one of them! The Dictator then makes speeches on loud-speakers in a kind of gibberish which sounds German-like, with the words sour kraut repeated many times. In a couple of crazy scenes, the Dictator is shown bouncing around a large medicine ball which looks like the world. In another, he confronts another Dictator who looks like Mussolini, and they engage in a race to the top in barber chairs! Then the awful helmeted police are after the barber, presumably because he's Jewish. Through a crazy series of madcap adventures, not unlike many of his silent films, the Tramp, who looks like the Dictator, eventually is mistaken for him, and compelled to make a speech, one of the greatest in cinematic history.What the Nazis were doing in Germany and then in Europe was no joke, but Mel Brooks pointed out that the only way to deal with their hypocrisy, prejudice, and ultimate lunacy, is to laugh at them. And that's what Chaplin did many years before Brooks' ""The Producers"". But inter-spliced in Chaplin's comedy is a very caustic criticism of fascism. Of course, the reality of the Holocaust was not known to Chaplin at the time of production, and I don't believe he was making light of Nazi atrocity. At the same time, by pointing out the ridiculousness of fascist dictators, Chaplin was really harpooning those who put themselves above others as infallible and the ludicrous behavior which goes with it, usually blind adoration. Ultimately, the Dictator is just a Tramp."
Quinoa1984,"Jun 7, 2006",10/10,"The Great Dictator came out at a time when it was riskiest, as on the brink of war a statement of the inaneness shifted n nuttiness of fascism, just shows how Chaplin had practically nothing to fear as an artist. That he is also able to incorporate a version of his usual tramp character into the mix, as a kind of general symbol (if that) of the ordinary shlub suddenly and madly under the gun, is part of the film's major appeal. Going back and forth between the styles of the film are tricky as well, as Chaplin's humor is similar but varying with the two sides of his characters. His Hynkel, the mad dictator of Tomania, is one of Chaplin's most inspired creations for himself, as he sputters off in a perfected gibberish/slant on the German-hate speech with many of the gags coming off. Some of these, ironically for the silent-film legend, are through the dialog pieces in his speeches and in the sometimes volatile and always nuanced (in the over-the-top way)with his underlings. Other bits just come from the way Chaplin's facial expressions go here to there- though his physical way of comedy isn't as strong as the other character he plays (aside from the appropriately iconic globe-tossing symbolism).In the other story we get a revamped Tramp- this time in the form of a Jewish barber- who in the midst of helping out a girl Hannah gets into some trouble with the overbearing troops from Hynkel's army. He also sees around him the effects from this dictatorship, of the Jews being sent to the gas chamber, but is spared and even acts as a sign of hope thanks to an old friend in Schultz. This all leads to a kind of case of mistaken identity, leading up to a 'big' speech. Big maybe being too broad a word to describe it- it's an outpouring of the highest kind that is able to work in such a satire, where all the points are spoken very clearly and to the point of being almost too simple. But the truth behind it undercuts the rest of the comedy in the film, which marks it as being memorable. And for myself as a viewer I remember both sides well. I still have fresh, admiring images in my head of Chaplin's barber running around being chased by the soldiers in the ghetto, how effortlessly a lot of this starts to seem when the craft turns to a beautiful transparency. There are certain parts of Chaplin's script, the final long talk aside, that ring out nicely.One of the best films of the early 1940's, this is also one of- if not the- classic of Chaplin's sound years, where a time in history that needed such a talent as his came through with a precise account of pathos, wit and silliness that all makes his films unique."
brchthethird,"Nov 14, 2014",9/10,"THE GREAT DICTATOR is a cinematic masterpiece with equal doses of vaudevillian humor and poignant drama. It is the story of Adenoid Hynkel and a Jewish barber. One aspires to take over the world, while the other just wants to live his life free of oppression. It is to Charlie Chaplin's credit that this film is able to speak to the human heart in such a moving way, which is what it's all about. Charlie Chaplin gives two excellent performances as the dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a Jewish barber. Both roles give him an opportunity to display the physical comedy which he was already so famous for. He also gets a lot of laughs by ranting in pseudo-German. The rest of the cast also do well in their roles, particularly the actor who played Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Mussolini). There was also some great cinematography and set design. The only minor thing I felt was wrong was the opening sequence, which I felt dragged on a little too long. Still, it was a nice throwback to Chaplin's previous silent movies and had some nice sight gags (really, there was quite a number of hilarious sight gags throughout). Overall, this should be seen by any self-respecting movie-lover, if only for the impassioned speech at the end, which ranks as one of the greatest movie speeches I've ever witnessed."
anh-arat,"Jan 23, 2005",10/10,"One of the best movie I have ever seen, the perfect comedy and parody in one. Adenoid Hynkel, Tomania, Benzino Napaloni, Garbitsch. My favorite parts of the film - when Mussolini arrives at the train station and he refuses to get off without a red carpet, and finally, he forgets his wife at the station; the part where Hynkel (Hitler) speaks ""German"" in front of his soldiers, when he is talking about Jews, his cough,pouring water in his trousers. Actually, the film also has a message of democracy at the end, when Hynkel and a Jewish barber accidentally change their position and a barber has to speak in front of soldiers and he speaks about a kindness among people and about an absurdity and brutality of the Nazi regime."
JayWolfgramm,"Jan 28, 2024",8/10,"This movie is both parts hilarious and historically significant. First, Charlie Chaplin as a ""totally not Hitler"" (but definitely Hitler) is historically perfect casting. Chaplin made his tiny mustache iconic in early cinema, and then Hitler made that same mustache infamous. Second, Charlie Chaplin is the man who is the face of silent films, every film on his ""Tramp Series"" is in AFI's Top 100 Films. The fact that this legend could end his famously silent character with perhaps cinema's most timely and powerful speech, spoken eloquently directly to the camera. That is the best punchline of all."
Gloede_The_Saint,"Apr 1, 2009",6/10,So this is the supposed comedy masterpiece from Chaplin. Well well. I agree that it has a few rather funny scenes and nd I loved the dictator of Backteria. A few moments of hysteric laughter where present but overall it wasn't that funny.We have Hinkler throwing a balloon version of the world around and mumbling/screaming this annoying German inspired fantasy language. And of course we have a guy who looks exactly like The Tramp who walks around and acts stupid. Not too funny at all. Paulette Goddard also left me incredibly dry in this one.BUT the worst part of the film is how this tries to be overly patriotic. Obviously it was made as a propaganda film against the Nazi's but that doesn't help. Long speeches about freedom are not fun at all and ruin the atmosphere completely.As stated there is some good in it too and it's perfectly watchable. I just disagree with the majority on this one I suppose but I really have a hard time understanding it's incredible status.
DrTuvok,"Dec 22, 2023",9/10,"Charlie Chaplin's previous two films, 'City Lights' and 'Modern Times', were his two absolute best films, trying as he was to prove that silent films still had a place in the all-talkie world. The quality of those films probably had something to do with this mission to prove something, for by the time he finally surrendered to sound with 'The Great Dictator', he turned completely to politics and things were not quite the same, though the film is still a sub-masterpiece, maybe his fifth best film.It's not the first Hitler comedy (the Three Stooges of all people beat Chaplin to the punch by less than a year), but by explicitly drawing attention to the duality of Hitler and the Chaplin persona, it's the most consistently funny. The globe scene alone is the best Nazi parody ever put to film, even better for the fact that the Nazis were growing in power at the time it was put out.My main caveat with the film would be Chaplin's extended speech at the end.It's visually dull: the camera stays centered on Chaplin's face as he delivers a grandiose political lecture straight to the audience, talking about peace, democracy, etc etc. It's surreal seeing all this egalitarian stuff coursing from the mouth of a Hitler look-alike, but is probably a good example of why directors such as Welles and Kubrick would later criticize Chaplin as director. Did he not trust the satirical content by itself and so saw fit to cap it off with what is essentially a 4-minute sermon? Even if people at the time 'needed' to hear such things, it's not very original now at all. For someone who had held out against the 'talkie' tidal wave for so long with such great results, it's disappointing that Chaplin would end up abusing dialog in this way right off the bat.It gives a taste of the didactic material he would incorporate into later films ('Monsieur Verdoux' had Chaplin's serial killer character justify his murders by grandiosely comparing himself to war heroes, and for all I could tell the director actually believed it) as well as giving a hint at the preachy tone many modern comedies would eventually take on. Not a good trend to start."
SnoopyStyle,"Mar 20, 2014",7/10,"Bumbling Jewish soldier (Charlie Chaplin) was lucky to survive WWI. He leaves the hospital years later suffering memory lost thinking he's gone for only a few weeks. Ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (Charlie Chaplin) has taken over the nation of Tomainia. The Jewish soldier returns to his barbershop in the ghettos. He gets into a fight with the storm troopers and earns the heart of the defiant washer woman Hannah (Paulette Goddard). He's about to be hung on a lamp post, but is rescue by Commander Schultz whom he saved during WWI. Then Hynkel loosens the reins on the Jews to attract a loan from a Jewish banker.I appreciate the attempt, but like 9/11, there were attempted jokes right after that was too soon. It's also too on-the-nose. Chaplin is playing the Jewish barber as the tramp lite. The story just doesn't quite have the comedy or the heart. Standing up to the storm troopers is the most compelling for the barber. Meanwhile dictator Hynkel is more weird than funny. It's how I feel about playing with the balloon globe. It's quirky weird but I would never laugh at it. Napaloni is a funnier dictator. Then there is the big final speech. Chaplin puts all his heart into it. Again I appreciate the attempt. It was probably more compelling back in the day. For all the appreciation at the political statement, I'm giving it a good score but not for any comedy."
abenr,"Aug 9, 2021",1/10,That the film is well-meaning does not make it any good. It's simply dreadful. Chaplin is awful as Hitler.
jrmartin1974,"Jun 6, 2005",10/10,"I can't believe I hadn't seen this movie until this evening. The fact that this film was made in 1940 is astonishing. Funny, touching and provocative are all words that come to mind to describe this film. Chaplin's genius is evident in his ability to incorporate his standard comedic ""schtick"" into the context of the story enriching the film as opposed to taking away from it. Chaplin's final speech brought me to tears. Although the acting style might be considered overwrought by today's standard, the content is incredible. Excellent supporting performances abound. I couldn't help remembering the hype around ""Life is Beautiful"" a few years back. People were shocked at a film using comedy to portray the horrors of the Holocaust. Although not dealing directly with the Holocaust, this film uses the same idea in a sometimes more successful and earnest way. When this film was made, there was a chance for it to make a difference. This film cements Chaplin's genius for me.If you love movies, see this film."
ieva-ozolniece,"Apr 22, 2016",8/10,"Judging from this films the jokes don't really change (if we compare nowadays and 1940). I mean the jokes are a bit lame and a bit predictable, but I definitely enjoyed it more than some cheesy comedies of the last years. The jokes in the movie seemed more pure. It is a bit sad to look at the impression of concentration camps and violent actions towards Jews, as in reality it was all incomprehensibly tragic and much more terrifying. But the movie is nice, sometimes it is a bit hard to follow and not to notice some editing details, for one who's used to modern movies, where you can't really find visual flaws that much. But I truly enjoyed the movie as it was more of a philosophical piece (as the speech at the end has become quite popular on the internet), but with some moments that I could laugh, though it is not easy to make me laugh. I really think this movie was ahead of it's time."
hg_krishnan,"Dec 3, 2000",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's portrayal of the romantic, kind barber against the serious(!) dictator is unmatched. The way he makes the speech (as Hitler) shows he is not new to talkies and adds to his histrionic achievements. That Charlie directed this movie shows his amazing imagination. Charlie will ever remain in his fans' hearts as the best actor that ever lived."

ROKA66,"Mar 1, 2003",10/10,"I had seen this movie on TV some years ago (at least 15) and when it hit the cinematheaters again this christmas I know I had to see this wonderful picture as it was ment to be over 60 years ago. Was my hopes satisfied? More than so! Despite some minor problems (unrelated to the movie it self; battery-malfunction on my hearingaid, need to go to the toilet and an ""desperatly"" laughing audiens (have to laugh, it's Chaplin, even when he just falls on his but!). Due to this problems I went to see it yet again two weeks later (fresh batterys and toiletvisit just before entering the theater. The Audience I can't do anything about!). So this time I coul fully appriciate the film! The Restoration makes it a pure joy to see, the opening scen looks like it was shoot just the other week, not more than 60 years ago.I didn't remember so much of the film as I thought, I think I might mix it up with some other War-movie with CC. But my favourite scen is something I will never forget, the great dictator dressed as an austrian sitting in a small boat with a big shotgun, I start to laugh even before you see him in the picture, greater comedy has probably never been seen on the great white screen. But this is not a comedy at first, it's very vitty and strong political documentation so ahead of it's time that it's hard to beleive it's so old. The Serious part of the story shouldn't have to be as (aktuellt) now as it were back then, but sadly it's probably even more now! Whithout a doubt this is one the greatest movies ever! (The word AKTUELLT is the swedish word for witch I can't find a proper translation right now, but I think you catch my point just the same!)"
stillalivegek,"Sep 25, 2024",9/10,"This movie honestly gives me a hope in humanity. It's a bit optimistic and you might think it doesn't take a topic of antisemitism and fascism seriously, at some points it's very melodramatic. Considering that, I think it still works. This is what people need in trying times. It's quite valuable to find something to laugh about in times when you don't have any idea what future holds and will you even survive. To give other people this burst of energy, hopeful optimism and lift voices of those who opposed Nazis in those times is respectable and worthwhile task.Speech at the end is very strong and really leaves an impression."
rick_7,"Nov 1, 2003",N/A,"*MILD SPOILERS*In this would-be satire, Chaplin set his sights on the evils of German fascism, playing the twin roles of Tomanian dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an inadvertent World War I hero and Jewish barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring Osterlich whilst finding time for numerous, oddly flat set-pieces. The dictator's much-celebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded, underwhelming and unfunny.Chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon Hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid - his much-maligned final speech is actually the bold, memorable highlight of the piece - but the film simply isn't sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it, nor to demand repeated viewings. The best gags are away from Hynkel's tiresome posturing and involve The Barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb (a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop.Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory, whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and The Great Dictator certainly ranks as such."
cricketbat,"Nov 23, 2018",6/10,"It's strange to think that The Great Dictator was made before the US entered World War II and before the world knew about the extent of Hitler's atrocities. This movie is an odd mixture of silly slapstick and serious social issues. It's an important film, historically, but Charlie Chaplin's first venture into talking pictures hasn't aged as well as his silent movies."
owen-watts,"Oct 4, 2020",8/10,"Chaplin's belated denouement for his Tramp character is essentially a strangely mixed drama/slapstick narrative roughly tacked on to quite a breathtakingly pointed contemporary political statement. That it was wildly popular but drubbed his career and signalled his decline is depressingly predictable - this is the fate of anyone who not only sticks their head above the parapet but pole-vaults over it whistling. Not all of it works, but the dreamy slapstick is surprisingly effective and the dark overtones are jarringly arresting to say the least. That final vaunted speech still rings out like a loud scream in the night from the darkest period in modern history. When I first saw it over a decade ago I was stunned and inspired. Now hearing it, it strikes a rather different feeling, and the night after seeing it I had restless horrible dreams of what would become of this statement now and what would happen to the ones making it."
leplatypus,"Apr 13, 2017",1/10,"Sure the project is honorable and courageous to kick dictators and alert about the oppressed but a movie is not a political work but an artistic one: honestly i tried to watch it but after 20 minutes of unfunny jokes, heavy pantomimes and silly grimaces, i had enough... The production looks cheap or the sets are really badly build, the scenes are tedious, endless, ... so that's really not my kind of fun and it's really discourages me of watching any Charlot movie after that! For the same subject, prefer the comics Maus!"
petarmatic,"Nov 25, 2013",9/10,"There are rare films which bring such a fantastic feel after you watched it. This film is up there with the other classics of Charlie Chaplin. I watched his work for so long and I saw it all, he just deserves all superlatives for his work.When I wanted to escape wars and problems, and there were couple of times of those situations, I felt like those two guys trying to hide in a box, just like in this film. And if you watch it you will see that scene.What else to say about work of Carlie Chaplin except that you have to watch it, and watch all of it! What a man, what a work!"
Dej,"Oct 27, 1998",10/10,"The master of cinema made this noble gesture at a time when others chose to be silent about the horror shaping in Europe. Innovative in combining sound and Chaplin's traditional silent, visual artistry, this film is an important milestone for the medium as well as the director."
lastliberal,"Sep 23, 2007",8/10,"The Great Dictator was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the first in which we heard the Little Tramp speak. Chaplin never used the Tramp character again after this film.This heartfelt satirical assault on Hitler and anti-Semitism is a tremendous badge of honor for Chaplin. Demoting Hitler to the level of a clown, he exposes the farcical base of fascism, much the same way Stanley Kubrick did with militarism in Dr. Strangelove.With Oscar class actors such as Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie, and featuring the original Storm Troopers long before Star Wars, this film was one of the greatest of all times."
Kubris,"Aug 2, 2011",9/10,"IMDb Top 250: 86The Great Dictator is a gem in film, and a gem in history. It's a shame so few people have seen it. This is one of my favourite, arguably number 1 comedy ever, and one of the best war movies ever made. I am not an easy critic to please when it comes to comedies, but the Great Dictator blew me away. It's incredible.The plot, for most of the film, doesn't go anywhere. This is beneficial for the film, because instead of forcing direction like many comedies, Chaplin decided to run the film like a series of sketch comedies. Alternating between the Dictator and the Barber, we see a series of situations occur to both characters. While the barber is 'similar' to the Tramp, Henkyl is outstanding. His first speech, absolute gibberish with a few words tossed in for humour, made me laugh out loud. Hard. I can't remember the last time a film made me do that.Towards the end, developments happen and the pacing is impeccable. Just when the sketches could start to seem redundant, the invasion plans start. Whereas most comedies stop humour for plot movement, the Great Dictator keeps the laughs rolling. I won't discuss the plot, but it sets up a timeless ending. (More on that later.) One other character tickled my funny bone- Napaloni. His Italian stereotype cracked me up, with his a-words, his a-hand gestures and costume. The satire here is spot-on. The film's ignorance is it's greatest strength. The film would be much safer, less shocking, or have not happened if Chaplin knew what was happening at the time. But because it was released when it was, we see a more raw, explicit parody of a madman and his ideas.It's funny, the importance of this film. A parody of a conflict, and what a conflict it was, while the war raged. Imagine if someone made an Afghanistan version (without puppets 'Team America') today, without fear of judgement or knowledge of the atrocities that are surely happening to both sides. That is the Great Dictator. Used to anger Axis soldiers (read the IMDb trivia), banned in many countries, and seen by Hitler himself twice. This is the movie I wanted Dr. Strangelove to be: zany and witty.The Great Dictator, despite its age, is one of the funniest movies I've seen. And then at th end, Charlie stops and gives a timeless, touching speech about war that I don't want to spoil: see it. A historical masterpiece. 9.5/10"
utgard14,"Sep 22, 2014",9/10,"Thought-provoking satire, brilliant at times, with memorable performances from a great cast. Drags a little in the middle but not enough to kill the pace. This was Charlie Chaplin's first full talkie. He plays dual roles and does a good job in both. Paulette Goddard has one of her most likable parts here (""Gee...ain't I cute?""). I'm not the biggest fan of hers but she is admittedly endearing in this picture and will likely win over most viewers like she did me. Excellent support from Jack Oakie, Henry Daniell, Reginald Gardiner, and many more. It's a funny movie but not a knee-slapper. The most powerful parts of the film, the parts that I think have made it such a classic, are the more serious parts. The famous speech scene near the end is something everyone should see. One of those moments where a movie can be something profound. That this movie was made when it was is all the more impressive. It's a time capsule in some ways but with a message that still resonates today."
Seraphion,"Aug 9, 2014",6/10,"Even though at first Chaplin didn't aim this movie to be a propaganda movie, the best of the era's condition, The World War II, got the best of the production instead. This makes the story feels too much overstretched. The slapstick and silly comedic moments aimed to defame the then common enemy of the Allies, Adolf Hitler, feels too long and too much hyperbolic. I must say though that the comedies are being done nicely. They are funny and enjoyable. The parody covers all aspects that are important about the war. Those include the parody of the symbols used by the Axis, and the other charismatic characters other than Hitler. It's quite nice to see how Chaplin manages in a movie with dialog after so many he did in the silent era."
estebangonzalez10,"May 5, 2014",9/10,"""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible.""That final five minute speech given by Chaplin shows his true genius as a director, actor, and screenwriter. He was capable of understanding better than anyone the social realities he was part of and made one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films I've seen. Giving his character who had been silent up to that film such an important speech was such a powerful and historical moment in film history. I don't know why I always believed Chaplin was one of those directors that never managed to handle the transition from silent films to talkies very well, because ironically this (his first complete talkie) is my favorite film of his. The way he was able to use his physical comedy with as little dialogue as possible and then add some funny lines was a beautiful touch. He said what he could with his physical performance and then used sound to say what actions couldn't tell wholeheartedly. Chaplin had proved that actions speak louder than words with his Tramp films, but when those words are in tune with actions they can blow you away and that is how I felt with The Great Dictator. In 1940 no one knew about the horrendous crimes the Nazi's were going to commit against the Jews, but Chaplin was warning the world from the beginning how hate and racism could destroy the world. That powerful speech continues to resonate with audiences almost 75 years later and you can add that scene to Chaplin's wonderful legacy in film. There are several other memorable scenes in this two hour film (the longest Chaplin film I've seen, yet probably the one I would be most likely to rewatch), mostly all involving Chaplin's wonderful physical comedy as he makes fun of Hitler. While the entire world seemed to be ignoring Hitler and Mussolini's abuse of power, Chaplin courageously was warning us in the best way he could, through slapstick comedy, about their horrendous racial beliefs and the dehumanization it would lead to.The film opens during the First World War where a soldier (Charles Chaplin) who is later introduced as a Jewish barber, is saving the life of a pilot named Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). They escape on a small plane, but eventually they crash and the barber loses his memory. Several years later he is released from the hospital but everything has changed. They lost the war, and Dictator Adenoid Hynke (also played by Charles Chaplin) is now rebuilding the country of Tomania. The Jews in the ghetto are being discriminated and treated poorly by Hynke's soldiers and the barber has no clue as to what is going on. A friendly neighbor named Hannah helps him, but there is not much they can do against the soldiers. When he gets into trouble with some of them, the commanding officer arrives and it happens to be Schultz who immediately helps the barber and offers him and the people in his ghetto protection. For a while things look good for them, but when Dictator Hynke discovers Schultz is helping the Jews he sends for his arrest and the Jews suffer persecution once again. Hynke plans to rule the world so his first step is invading Osterlich, the place where Hannah and her family were forced to flee. Things aren't looking good for the Barber and his friends, but keeping his head up and joining forces with Schultz, they are ready to make a stand.The Great Dictator was truly a delightful and joyous experience. I don't know why I liked it more than his silent films because I really enjoyed all of them, but there was something about The Great Dictator that just hit all the right notes with me. I fell in love with this film and will definitely recommend it as my favorite Chaplin film. I wasn't considering watching his next two talkies, but after the experience I had with The Great Dictator I'm definitely considering watching them. I loved the way Chaplin clearly stated his beliefs in this film, mocking Hitler and his inhumane ideas with a courageous performance considering no one was doing anything to stop him at that time. But it's not just a brave film, it is really funny as well and I found myself laughing throughout many scenes. His physical comedic talents can still be seen in this talkie; one of his most memorable scenes involves a globe dance sequence. Paulette Goddard, who was also in Chaplin's Modern Times, gives yet another sweet performance, and Jack Oakie will forever be remembered for his role as Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, which was a clear lampoon on Mussolini. This was one perfectly executed satire that happened to come along at the right moment. Unlike in other politically correct films, Chaplin makes it evident that ridiculing Hitler was his main objective. It is a classic and a must see for film lovers everywhere."
AAdaSC,"Jun 15, 2014",6/10,"Charlie Chaplin plays 2 roles. He is a Jewish barber who fought in the First World War for the Germans as well as Nazi leader Adenoid Hynkel. We follow their two separate stories until the film culminates in the barber giving his address to the might of the Germany military.Charlie Chaplin is funny and we get moments of 'laugh-out-loud' funny, because of the situations, his demeanour and his reactions. ""Would you like a cigarette?"" is the question, ""Not now"" comes the response from Chaplin as he hangs from a plane.However, the film is too long. We get far too much Hitler preachy stuff, some tiresome shouting with Jack Oakie playing the Mussolini role and a very obvious food fight. There is also a strange scene of Hitler playing with a balloon of the globe – it's balletic but not funny. Just weird. Unfortunately, some scenes do drag on and I found myself constantly wanting a story to unfurl. I think it was a good decision by him to make this film as he really does go to town with mocking Hitler."

loudrossbusiness10,"Jun 17, 2015",10/10,"This movie is a testament to the genius of Chaplin. Its sharp witty dialogue, its clever use of slapstick, its believable characters and its brilliant message have managed to stand for decades. The fact this movie continues to shine even to this day proves its worth. The great dictator is not just held up by its comedy though, it is also held up by the fantastic performances by all of the actors involved. Chaplin knew what he wanted and it translated perfectly on the screen. The great dictator isn't as widely remembered as some of Chaplin's other works, but it deserves to be. While other movies of its era, such as citizen Kane, also remain master-pieces in their own rights. None effect the audience quite like the great dictator."
agrawalmannu,"Oct 21, 2005",8/10,"As a kid I thought Charlie Chaplin could be very funny but now I know that he could be very sad as well and at the same time. All his films although funny on surface have melancholic undercurrents and that's what probably makes him one of the most influential filmmakers of our times.When this movie came out, some felt that it was badly done and some felt that it was in bad taste but over the years it has acquired the status of a great classic and a great satire. It seems Hitler, who sported Chaplin mustache in his efforts to be loved and admired like Chaplin, watched this movie twice and Chaplin later admitted ""I would give anything to find out what he thought about the movie"". We can only guess and wouldn't be very wrong in thinking he must have hated it and would have thrown Chaplin in one of his concentration camps if only he could lay his hands on him somehow.Hynkel with that globe balloon is hilarious and the last speech by the Jewish Barber brings tears."
loserfilmnerd,"Apr 17, 2011",10/10,"The Great Dictator is such a brilliant mixture of biting satire and hilarious slapstick. Charlie Chaplin was the first person brave enough to insult Hitler's overblown ego, and also the first to speak out against his wrongs.Chaplin once again proves to be a very energetic comedian, while at the same time doing it with the deadpan style of the silent days. He also gives us a ton of wonderful, well thought out and timed gags, showing us why he's the greatest comedian who ever lived. And he mixes all that with a heartwarming romance and social commentary, which fully proves his genius.Like I said before, this also shows us what life was like for Jews back then, while brilliantly avoiding being too depressing. It's been said that Charlie Chaplin wouldn't have made this movie had he known about the full extent of Hitler's crimes against humanity, this is still a respectful satire of the situation. It never makes too light of the situation, except for maybe a joke about a gas that can kill everyone (I bet Chaplin especially regretted that joke after learning about everything).Another thing I loved about this was the famous speech at the end. It was so epic, heartfelt and inspiring that it made me want to march right up to Hitler and kill him myself. Except, uh, I guess it's a little too late for that. But the speech was still epic.I recommend this to any fan of Charlie Chaplin and anybody who enjoys good political satire."
Hongyang-55,"Sep 30, 2024",9/10,"In the satirical comedy-filmThe Great Dictator, Charlie Chaplin portrays two characters: a lowly Jewish barber who is mistaken for the despotic Adenoid Hynkel and a merciless dictator. The impact of tyranny and the value of human decency are both examined in the movie.""The Great Dictator"" was Chaplin's first real sound picture, released in 1940. It was created as World War II was intensifying, a period of intense political unrest around the world. In a Hollywood that was reluctant to alienate strong foreign enemies, Chaplin made a daring political statement by using his movie to attack Adolf Hitler and Nazism.Social Change and Justice Aspect: The movie makes a powerful statement on the perils of autocracy and the significance of defending liberty and human rights. In the history of film, Chaplin's farewell address is still regarded as one of the strongest pleas for compassion and peace. Comparing This to Do the Right Thing, ""Do The Right Thing"" and ""The Great Dictator"" both address significant societal injustices of their own eras. While Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" employs a dramatic narrative to illustrate racial tensions and the need for social change inside urban America, Charlie Chaplin uses humor to critique fascism and preach peace.Chaplin uses his gift for physical humor to convey a strong message by fusing serious political commentary with slapstick humor. His creative use of sound and his well-known parting remark set the movie apart from the mainstream of the time. Chaplin's versatility as an actor and director is demonstrated by his dual roles as the barber and the tyrant. The film manages to be both poignant and enjoyable because to its clever blending of humor and serious subjects.A timeless masterpiece, The Great Dictator blends humor with a powerful political message. If you're interested in how movies can affect societal change, you have to see it. A timeless picture, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator used satire to convey a potent message about the value of human decency in the face of oppression. Audiences around the world are still drawn to it because of its relevancy."
Benjamin-M-Weilert,"May 19, 2019",10/10,"By far the funniest film about Adolf Hitler ever made. ""The Producers"" doesn't even come close. And while this was Chaplin's first fully talking film, a lot of his slapstick remained. It was nice to see that he certainly had a lot to say (especially at the end) after years of silence on the silver screen. It's impressive to realize that this film came out in 1940, before the US even entered WWII, and how bold it must have been at the time."
toll-8,"Jan 18, 2012",6/10,"The Great Dictator Starring: Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie, Reginald Gardiner. Running time: 125 minutes Year: 1940 Directed by: Charlie Chaplin Written by: Charlie Chaplin In his time, Chaplin has made some great films. Compared to lacklustre comedy of today it is still a masterpiece, despite still being completely out there. His comedy is not for everyone and at times is very subjective, especially with it being repeated from film to film, however with The Great Dictator we find something completely different, this is a comedy but one with huge themes and a giant message. The film is based around the beginning of the Second World War and pokes fun at the tyrant that is Adolf Hitler, before he had even become his most evil. The film brandishes him for all of his sins before he has even committed them. After doing a little research, some believed that this film could have been the tipping point for Hitler himself! We start off following Chaplin during the First World War, where he accidentally saves a man's life on the eve of its end. This man ends up rising high in the new government where as Chaplin suffers memory loss from his exploits during this war and ends up being hospitalised. When he finally returns to his home in the Ghetto, where he is a barber, he sees that a new Dictator has taken over and his town is being terrorised by Storm Troopers. This new Dictator is Henkel, a portrayal of Hitler himself, also played by Chaplin. He is the leader of Tomania and is deciding whether to issue war or a truce against fellow Dictator Napaloni, leader of Bacteria. If this isn't taking the mick I don't know what is. In the Ghetto the Barber , on several occasions, attacks the Storm Troopers for racially abusing him as a Jew, and upon capture is save by the man he saved years before in the war. The Barber is then deemed untouchable and continues his life whilst wooing the woman next door. However his luck changes when the man he saved is outcast as a traitor and the Storm Troopers cease their chance to get their own back on the Barber, leaving him in a Concentration Camp. The film is hard to believe considering it came out before many of Hitler's war crimes took place, especially with on watching you see how true all this seemed to become. At the time the film was tarnished as unwittingly brandishing the Jews. Little did Chaplin know that in hindsight he was right on the money. On reading this you will think the film is very unlike Chaplin and to be fair it is, but we are still treated to the very same Chaplinesque moments, all which break the tension when it is needed. At one point Henkel shoots a guard dead before walking off and tripping up his own feet. You get his evil brandished with his stupidity. However Henkel is portrayed in a way that you never sympathise with him and in fact always hate him. You laugh at him, not with him and I can only imagine how hard that must have been to do at the time of this film. In hindsight we can happily laugh at the man that attempted to destroy the majority of the planet but back then, on the eve of the beginning, this must have been seen as a step too far. It is deep considering it is Chaplin and upon watching I found myself enjoying it but not for all the typical Chaplin reasons. Yes it made me laugh but it is nowhere near as funny as some of his previous work. On the other hand there is a much deeper plot and narrative and ultimately a real meaningful message. The only thing that keeps this in keeping with previous Chaplin is the horrible continuity problems, but I'm starting to expect that from old films. It's just something though I can't allow my eye to miss. It is a decent film and you will be engaged, however you will find yourself at times thinking that the comedy elements are completely out of place, especially when it is not seen in hindsight by Chaplin himself. Not one of Chaplin's best but I'm sure the film he will be most remembered for. His final speech, spoken out of character by Chaplin himself, is a message to all those out there during the war and does put a lot of their pains into perspective.3 / 5TolliCheck out my blog: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

cathcacr,"Aug 30, 2001",7/10,"Great comedy from Charlie Chaplin.  I've seen Chaplin's 4 major films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator), and I think it is easily the funniest of the four.  This movie had me laughing more than almost any other I've ever seen.  From the very opening disclaimer (""Any similarity between the Great Dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental"") the movie is a laugh-a-minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor.  And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution.  Maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting timeliness of the subject matter, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me."
Zooha-47207,"Dec 25, 2024",2/10,"I find that lots of reviewers find this nice, just because other people say it's nice.The Great Dictator is often lauded as one of Charlie Chaplin's most significant works, blending humor with political commentary on fascism and dictatorship during the prelude to World War II. However, while the film's message may have been groundbreaking for its time, it feels outdated and clunky by today's standards.The acting, particularly from Chaplin, feels overly theatrical and exaggerated, which detracts from the intended satire. The humor is slapstick-heavy and rarely lands, making the film more tedious than engaging. The storyline also lacks focus, with scenes that feel disconnected and drawn out."
jul2407,"May 24, 2006",10/10,"We get such an overwhelming feeling at the end of the movie when the Barber speak, while Paulette Godard is hearing him ; this feeling is unique and incredible, and I never felt that way in a movie anymore since. Chaplin was by far the best for communicating feelings from his movies, The Great Dictator, as well as City Lights and The Kid are movies of great sensations and feelings, never a movie will touch our soul like this ... He is still very appreciated in France, and is very often on the air, we Frenches very much like Charlotn his humor, his tenderness, his wonderful talent for directing actors and actresses. This movie was very smart, it was made when the world has two big celebrities : Chaplin and Hitler ; they are born the same year, has the same kind of celebrity, and the fact that Chaplin was kind of considered like the Hitler's Public Enemy N°1 add another reality characteristic in this movie."
carlgt1,"Feb 23, 2001",10/10,"It's tough discovering Charlie Chaplin films like ""The Great Dictator"" and even ""Modern Times.""  They put you through such a range of emotions from comedy through tragedy in one show that you feel schizophrenic.  I guess that's more power to the artistry of Chaplin.  ""The Great Dictator"" is obvious in it's sadness since it was done in 1940, and the movie finishes with such hope but looking back from our ""modern times"" we all know that there were five more miserable years of Nazi facism, concentration camps, and misery.This is obviously a great propaganda piece, but there's much more to it than something like Olivier's jingoistic ""Henry V"" (another excellent film of the period).  What I find refershing is how perceptive Chaplin is in his speech at the end to unite all religions and races etc.  Sadly enough it sounds dated to our ""modern"" ears, sort of like John Lennon's ""All You Need Is Love"" must sound in this era of right-wing talk-radio pundits pushing ""compassionate conservatism.""PS -- There's so much in this film that's eternal it's awkward reading some of the misinformation in the reviews, and people whining about the costumes or whatever.  For instance, in the review from Aug 12, 2000 that they are using as the only review on the front page of IMDB.  It wasn't the Hynkel/Dictator who was ""endearing"" in the gun & upside-down aeroplanes.  I thought it was obvious that was the barber, who after his antics as a soldier crashed with Schultz and had amnesia."
LeonLouisRicci,"Apr 17, 2013",10/10,"Unforgettable political satire that was tumultuously topical and cannot be realized today with any real assimilation of place and time. It was a brave and biting commentary on the Headlines of the day and prophetically postured what was to be uncovered.A marvelous and unsettling, in retrospect, account of the marching goose-steps of Gestapo tactics and unnatural Nationalism and Fascism. In 1940 this was funny, as it is today, but in just a short time after its release its subject matter could only elicit nervous, under the breath, reluctant half-smiles.It is a graceful and searing poke in the eye at a megalomaniacal Leader of a Sheeple population that was mesmerized by psychological tricks and economic persuasion. A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled.This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations.There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns. One of the best from one of the best...Charlie Chaplin."
George-Allahham,"Jul 31, 2024",8/10,"Another classic of Chaplin, a great way to employ the Second World War in this comedic way, the narrative of the film shows the absurdity and trivial reasons for the invasion and destruction of peoples, the persecution of different races, religions and people, the stupid idea of the supremacy of one race, the creator Chaplin employed comedy to show the stupidity of dictatorship and racial backwardness, a story that was wonderfully woven to show the human side and the brutal side with two different characters performed by the legendary Charlie Chaplin, the romance of the film is light and gentle, there was some boredom in the film, but expressive and wise, especially the final speech that leaves an imprint on you and a deep human idea of how to spread peace, Chaplin used a verse from the Bible and that was wonderful, it's amazing to think that Chaplin is writing, directing and acting, what a great work."
BadWebDiver,"Aug 1, 2005",10/10,"Yes, well ... I've always said Buster Keaton was my favorite classic comic of all-time. Especially masterpieces like THE GENERAL, and SHERLOCK JUNIOR, Keaton was actually **funny**; while Chaplin tended to be **just** simply cute and sweet (obvious connection to modern humour there).Now I've just seen this one, and I've finally admitted that Chaplin does have the knack to be out-and-out rib-ticklingly hilarious. Of course, I could also have remembered classics like ""Easy Street"" and of course ""Modern Times"" (which I really have to check upon again); but definitely in this film, there were scenes that were so perfect and spot-on hilarious, with impeccable timing and pure side-splitting hilarity.Not only the famous ""playing with the world scene""; but the whole opening segment with the Big Bertha gun; including the bit with the anti-aircraft gun, the walking through the smoke scene, and of course the upside-down aircraft bit. Pure comic genius!!!And to top it off; the absolute satirical punch of the Dictator Hynkle - the speeches, the gestures, the bits with the microphones, the competition with Napolini... And I think Jack Oakie has to be totally on par with Chaplin in this movie. The sheer gusto of the big guy's performance is breathtaking. Especially the classic ""food fight"" scene! This film has all the great comic bits!Another actor that doesn't get enough credit I think in most discussions of this movie is Henry Daniell. I just saw him a few months back in TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS - the difference in character between that and this is quite amazing. Further proof that with the right material, a very serious drama actor can be a great choice for a comic movie. (Am I the only one who Garbitch reminds of Professor Snape? Not knocking either character or anything, though.)And the final big point - just look at the date this film was released (1940 - right in the middle of WWII.) Talk about topical! Can you imagine any filmmaker today who would have the guts to make this type of movie about a subject matter that was hitting the headlines so blatantly? It would be like the Farrally brothers today doing a trash comedy about Osama Bin Laden - (and I know just mentioning the idea is going to have some people flame me ferociously!) And to think modern filmmakers think they're ""so current and trendy - not like the olden days when people just made frivolous entertainment."" Ha! Double Ha!Thie is a true comic masterpiece. It made my top 100 list."
Michael_Elliott,"Sep 21, 2018",N/A,"The Great Dictator (1940)**** (out of 4)A poor Jewish barber (Charles Chaplin) returns back to his hometown and quickly realizes that things aren't quite the same. Soldiers are ruling the streets and have a thing against Jews. At the same time, Tomania dictator Hynkel (Chaplin) decides to try and rule more of the world.THE GREAT DICTATOR would turn out to be Chaplin's first all talking picture and that by itself makes this rather historically important. With that said, while the film was a hit when it was released, the writer-director would find himself getting some rather heated attention and as time went on the film grew even more controversial. Chaplin would say he wouldn't have made the picture like he did had he known what actual horrors were going on in the world and there's no doubt that this film didn't exactly help his career.With that said, while it's not quite in the same league as CITY LIGHTS or MODERN TIMES, I do think the picture is a great one and one that deserves a lot more credit than it usually gets. There are a lot of really great moments in this film and of course the one most people remember is the dictator playing with the world as he dance around hitting the ball. That is a classic scene but the opening sequence set during WWI is also a comic masterpiece as we get all sorts of wonderful gags and especially the moments in the plane.Some people feel that a satire of something like Hitler and what was going on in the world was a major no but I do think the film has its heart in the right place. Again, perhaps Chaplin wouldn't have made the film had he known what was going on but it was too late once the movie was complete. As a comedy it works extremely well but I also thought it worked perfectly well as a drama and especially the relationship between the barber and a young woman (Paulette Goddard) that he falls for. Then there's the ending and the speech, which is another classic scene and shows that the film did have something to say even with the satire.The entire cast does a wonderful job and that includes the performances by the likes of Henry Daniell, Reginald Gardiner, Billy Gilbert and Goddard. Speaking of Goddard, she is a pure delight here and really does a terrific job with her role. As far as Chaplin goes, he really does a terrific job and delivers two of the greatest performances of his career. He's simply wonderful as the barber but there's no question that the real magic comes from him playing Hynkel, which of course was meant to be Hitler. The uncanny resemblance between the two is one thing but how Chaplin plays the role is just flawless.THE GREAT DICTATOR is a really strong and effective film and one that deserves more credit."
robert_deniro_tale,"Feb 20, 2012",10/10,"It is the best movie I have ever seen. The way that Chaplin depicts Hitler and combines Hitler's sovereignty with idiocy makes us start feeling that he was a real stupid. The scene that he is playing with the globe balloon and all of sudden it blows gives us an excellent model of what was going on for Reich and the Fuhrer. He imitates Hitler's way of speaking very significantly and even though I don't know one German word, I knew that he was saying nonsense to imply that Hitler's speeches were all nonsense. He plays Hitler's role like a bumpkin to show that his actions were all unwise.The movie reaches its zenith at the final scene that the Jewish barber gets to talk for the world. The scene is shot masterfully such that we are really inspired that we and Hannah are listening to him along with all alive creatures in the world. I am not overrating it; this scene is a masterpiece after all.The Great Dictator not only points to Hitler, but also to all the dictators bigger or smaller than Hitler and I think what we see in this movie will last forever. As long as dictatorship and fascism exist you can watch ""The Great Dictator"" and see Chaplin talking to all generations.Chaplin is still alive! Do not miss this movie!"
SmileysWorld,"Aug 28, 2014",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin is amazing to watch.He brought the very talents that mesmerized us in his great silent films to the sound era,thereby giving us the best of both worlds in this film.The sound era was unkind to many a silent star,but not Chaplin.He made the transition with flying colors.He showed us new talents,while not letting us forget all of those elements from his silent films that made him a star.There is great support all around him,and his final speech at the end was stunning.Upon seeing it once,I had to go back and watch it again several times,not only for Chaplin's great performance,but for it's rousing message,which could be considered just as relevant today.Great comedy film and great film."
eshwarmail,"Nov 16, 2012",9/10,"One of the funniest opening sequences followed by a highly audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious work of Charlie Chaplin ending with a rousing poignant speech. While playing his run-of-the-mill tramp character with his usual flourish, Chaplin delivered a masterstroke as Hynkel - a mockery of Hitler by generating laughs from the eccentricity and egotistic nature of the character. By making a comedy out of the highly precarious situation of the Jews exactly during the full blown Holocaust might have garnered a reputation for bad taste, but enough care was taken not to hurt feelings and all the angst is directed towards the fascists.A Jewish Barber (Charles Chaplin) suffers amnesia after getting injured in the war saving a General. The barber remains contained in a hospital staying ignorant to the ascent of a tyrant Hynkel - the eccentric dictator of Tomania (Charles Chaplin again) and the condition of his kind. When he stands up to the harassing fascist soldiers after walking into the turbulent world he earns love of Hannah (Paulette Goddard) but wrath from the fascists saved timely by the General. Meanwhile Hynkel is plotting to invade Osterlich by tricking Napolini, the dictator of Bacteria into pulling back their army.Charles Chaplin is already a legend in playing the tramp character, but Hynkel was a different ballgame for him. It is a character of aggression, superiority and eccentricity but still clumsy as the tramp. The war sequences, rich palace settings elevates the scale of the movie compared to his previous outing, an equally magnificent 'Modern Times'. Chaplin is a gifted all rounder with a profound writing talent that always portrays the triumph of looking at life in positive outset and a sense of humor. The background score is melodious and rich according the situations. Paulette Goddard looks aged and heavy compared to 'Modern Times' but retains the charm and infective energy she possessed there. The remaining actors and the technical departments do an apt job in putting together this masterpiece.Audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious"
billcr12,"Mar 21, 2012",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin made the great dictator in 1940. In it he plays a megalomaniac intent on taking over the world; wonder who that might be? The little tramp wears a very familiar mustache, making him look like Adolf Hitler.Chaplin plays both a Jewish barber at the beginning and then a dictator named Adenoid Hynkel later on. The leader gives a rallying speech in pure gibberish, Chaplin studied Hitler's voice for real and does a vicious impression, gesticulating like the lunatic Nazi and portraying him for the fool that he was.Only could a genius take such a tragic and harrowing story and make a searing and funny satire. Chaplin has done it with style and grace."
disneyland_one_fan,"Nov 4, 2006",9/10,"What an amazing performance by probably the most talented comedian in history! His over-acting personality fits perfectly of a parody of Hitler. I'm sure he's was outraged when the Tramp did this film, but he deserves it. The final scene is one of my favorites in the whole movie. Throughout the whole film you see a comedian making fun of one of the most evil humans in history, but in the end you a truly amazing actor who almost looks as if he's going to cry give an amazing speech of human dignity. The acting from Charlie Chaplin is probably the best performance of the the 1940's in my opinion. In this film he could make people laugh, cry, rejoiced with love or (if your a Nazi) hate him. The point is... his performance was amazing and I think it is by far his best work."
MaxBorg89,"Dec 6, 2005",10/10,"This timeless masterpiece is deservedly a milestone in movie history and in my opinion it's Charlie Chaplin's best movie. I had already seen him in other great films (Modern Times is comedy gold) but The Great Dictator stands alone as a funny yet serious movie that delivers an important message by making fun of one of the worst atrocities that ever took place. He mocks war and extermination in order to become a messenger of peace (his final speech is one of the best monologues I've ever heard), and he doesn't hesitate to achieve that through a satire on WWII Germany and Adolf Hitler.The movie's two protagonists are both played by Chaplin himself: one is a Jewish barber recovering from amnesia after a war accident who falls in love with Hannah (Paulette Godard), a girl who lives in the ghetto; the other one, who looks just like the barber, is dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who's planning to invade a couple of countries and overshadow ""colleague"" Napaloni (aka Mussolini) as well as exterminate the Jewish minority. Expect trouble, misunderstandings and lots of laughs...This film is perhaps the best satire ever made, as Chaplin manages to entertain while still blaming the horrors committed by the Nazis, and he perfectly embodies both the romantic naive barber, who has one of the funniest lines in the movie (""Strange.And I thought you were an Aryan."" ""No, I'm a vegetarian.""), and the megalomaniac, ego-driven, constantly shouting Hynkel (his improvised speeches in fake German are hilarious), delivering a movie that makes people laugh and also think. Like other Holocaust-related films (Schindler's List, La Vita è Bella, The Pianist) it makes sure we'll never forget the past and learn from our mistakes."
Petey-10,"Sep 12, 2001",N/A,"Charles Chaplin plays Hynkel, Dictator of Tomania.He also plays a Jewish barber.Resemblance between these two is coincidental.The Jewish barber fights in the first world war and he loses his memory.He comes back to the ghetto and realizes that Hynkel has started the persecution of Jews.And why?Because he thinks that the Aryans are the best race and the others must be destroyedThe Great Dictator from 1940 is Charles Chaplin's first talkie.It is a movie that shows how horrible the Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler were.He started making the movie in 1936 when practically nobody knew what kind of power Hitler had in his hands.They didn't know how he was going to send the Jews to concentration camp and brutally get them killed there.Now it's obvious that the man was insane.How could anybody think he was a great man and there was some sense in his speeches.Hitler was an idiot.It's nice that somebody could make a movie which laughs right at Hitler's face.Chaplin has told later that he wouldn't have made this comedy if he had known how much the Jewish people actually had to suffer.Also an other fascist leader gets laughed at; Benito Mussolini.In the movie he is Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria and he is played by Jack Oakie.The acting work in this movie is superb.Chaplin is amazing in the double role.Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at that time, is Hannah in the movie and she is doing terrific role work.Everything works perfectly in this great comedy which showed that Chaplin did very well in a talkie.He only made five talkies.The first one is the best alongside Limelight.There are some excellent scenes in this satire.In one scene you can see Hynkel playing with the globe and the scene after that shows the Jewish barber doing his work while Brahms symphony is playing on the radio.It is one of my favorite scenes and the funniest in the movie.Of course there are some serious scenes in the movie.You can't make this kind of movie all funny.The ending isn't funny at all and it's better that way.There the barber makes a speech for humanity and tolerance.It is a very touching scene and made my eyes a little wet.He tells us to love one and other and he gives hope to us all.In today's world I can't see too much hope for the mankind.Many people don't even want to become tolerant.Those people judge other people because of the color of their skin or their religion.I tell you to stop being intolerant and unite!Tolerance is the key to the better world."
Incalculacable,"Apr 13, 2006",7/10,"This was Chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. The movie is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm.When compared to Chaplin's earlier works, this is quite pale in comparison. The sweet, funny style of his silents, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. There are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. If this was a silent, it probably would not have happened.I find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance. One of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.The Great Dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both Chaplin's history and movie history. It is flawed, but Chaplin is in great form."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Aug 18, 2001",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin was still making silent films as late as 1936 because he began his career as a silent filmmaker and therefore that is where most of his talent seemed to lie. His tramp remains one of the most recognizable figures in cinematic history even almost 100 years after his introduction, but Chaplin knew at the time that it would probably be fatal to the character and possibly to his career if he were to give the tramp a voice. People just wouldn't be able to accept it, or at least it would just not sound right. However, in The Great Dictator, he seems to pull off this seemingly impossible feat very successfully.Sure, it's true that he wasn't exactly the tramp in The Great Dictator, but the costume and the behavior was similar enough for them to be considered the same character. In this film, the tramp is a Jewish barber who lost his memory during battle in World War I, and therefore doesn't understand what's happening when he is later discriminated against by the Nazis. He later becomes confused with Hynkel, the Nazi leader who looks exactly like him. This misidentification does not happen until pretty late in the film, so it is the events that lead up to it that make up most of the comedy here.It's pretty obvious that Hynkel is a thinly disguised parody of Adolf Hitler, which is fitting because Hitler copied the tramp's mustache as his own. Chaplin was always very sympathetic to the poor and underprivileged in his films, and he took the oppression of the Nazis as another chance to do that. He makes a hilarious mockery of Hitler while preserving just the right amount of respectability and authority in his character so that he remains credible. Hynkel is clearly a bumbler in the film, and it's great to see that Chaplin had the nerve to give Hitler a good slap back in 1940.The Great Dictator has been criticized for the fairly extensive speech that ends the film, if only because it is so uncharacteristic of a Chaplin film, but that is unquestionably one of the most powerful scenes in the film. Chaplin spends the entire two hours making you laugh at the tragedy that is going on in Europe at the time, but at the end he gets serious and really makes sure that his message is felt powerfully. As was the case almost 50 years later in Life Is Beautiful, a story about the Nazi Holocaust is told in an entertaining and amusing way, but the powerful message does not lose any of its effectiveness because of that. Chaplin made dozens of hilarious films about uncomfortable subjects and topics, and The Great Dictator remains one of the best and most memorable, as well as one of the most important."
k844140,"Jul 16, 2021",7/10,"I liked this film less than Modern Times, The Kid, The Gold Rush or City Lights. Why? There are several reasons for it. First of all, to my mind, Chaplin's films about The Tramp are much better being silent than talking. In his previous films Charles demonstrated us how beautifully he managed to show everything without dialoges. These films were much funnier. In The Great Dictator we have some moments of visual humor, but they are more rare and less funny. I really liked about 10 moments, especially the one with pudding, but in other Chaplin's movies I laughed or smiled all throughout the film. So the main disadvantage of this picture is having just a few really funny moments, though film is much longer than other ones about The Tramp. I know what Charles intented to make laugh at, but maybe war isn't the topic he made best films about. Many dialoges are dull or pointless, as well as some scenes in the movie. But others I liked. For instance, the way the barber is represented or his last speech. The speech is really great and is much better than other dialoges in this movie. It's a shame that people still don't understand the things Chaplin said.All in all, this is not the best film about The Tramp, not the best comedy about WW2 (in this respect I like Life is Beautiful and Jojo Rabbit more), and not the best film about war either. But it's definitely not a bad movie. Its humorous jokes, final speech and some other moments still make it a good movie, though not as good as other Chaplin's movies."
ACitizenCalledKane,"Jan 21, 2005",8/10,"Charles Chaplin's The Great Dictator is a political statement wrapped in a comedy with a little bit of drama here and there. It is not his best work, but I would definitely recommend it to Chaplin fans. I feel that Charlie Chaplin was at his most powerful in his silent films. Here, he seems a little unsure of himself, in terms of balancing acts that he could pantomime with verbal jokes. Don't get me wrong, there is some hilarious dialog in this movie. It is not short on laughs by any means, but Chaplin's best films had a brilliant sense of balance to them, a balance between drama and comedy that few have ever been able to match. It is a very good movie, but, unfortunately I don't feel it matches up against Chaplin's best, although, I can't think of many films that do! What this film does have going for it, and it has quite a bit going for it, is another brilliant performance from Charles Chaplin. Only this time, aside from his spectacular physical comedy, Chaplin proves he also knows how to deliver his lines with a comedic timing that is every-bit as precise as his pantomime. The highlights are the brilliant dance with the globe and the powerful, moving speech that Chaplin gives at the end of the film. His performance as Adenoid Hynkel, a biting satire of Adolf Hitler, is so off-the-wall, so silly that it accomplishes exactly what Chaplin sought out to do - to make the world laugh at Hitler, to rob him of his power. Mel Brooks would do a fine job of defaming Hitler twenty-eight years later in his hilarious debut film, The Producers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this movie (that isn't expressed in the speech at the end), it's that laughter can sometimes be the best medicine. While no one can ever undo the atrocities that Hitler exposed the world to, we can survive, as long as we have our ideals and our sense of humor."
anton-6,"Nov 4, 2001",10/10,"This film was made 1940 and then you could not show the madness of Hitler as it really was and Chaplin himself says that if he knew that the Nazi´s were that evil he could never have done this film.But Chaplin can show Hitler´s madness when he plays the VERY crazy and evil dictator Hynkel in the country Tomania.It´s a very strange film that is both a hilarious slapstick comedy and a satire.He plays two roles in this: a Jewish Barber that is almost as the tramp and The crazy dictator Hynkel.It also includes some of Chaplin´s best moments:The barber scene(it´s almost as good as the famous scene in ""the gold rush"".The Dance of the rolls)and the speech is easily one of Chaplin´s best moments.5/5"
BIG BOB-4,"Sep 17, 1999",10/10,"very clever, great pathos and of course great comedy and humor! The sarcasm, and ironic comedy are magnificent and way ahead of it's time! This movie is always rated 4 stars by every movie critic in the business and shouldn't be missed if available!!"
RM851222,"Sep 2, 2015",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Great Dictator"" (1940) is only 3rd movie with / by Charles Chaplin that i saw. After watching ""City Lights"" (1931)and ""Modern Times"" (1936) i can safely say that ""The Great Dictator"" is best of this trio.Charles Chaplin is brilliant in double role here, and he shines in both of them, while two of these characters are biggest opposites possible. Direction of this movie (also by Charles Chaplin) is great, and writing is brilliant (Charles Chaplin). I was involved in this movie from the first scene till closing one, and WHAT a speech at the end! I think this speech was more for the people watching this movie (and breaking a 4th wall at the same) - it is a triumph.Overall, ""The Great Dictator"" is a great movie by all accounts. It is involving, very funny, tells a story and sends universal and essential message. What else do you want from motion picture?"
tnrcooper,"Jul 11, 2014",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin turns his comic focus on the dictators of his time - Mussolini and Hitler. He mocks their mien, their speech, and their policies. Chaplin shows himself to be brave and shows again that he is a comic genius. His imitation of Hitler and the scene of Hitler hanging from a moving plane shine in this film as Chaplin's shoe eating did in ""Gold Rush"". In contrast to the dictators' policies, he offers a beautiful vision of the future.Chaplin obviously is a comic genius and was deeply committed to opposing tyranny. He used the talents he had to oppose it, and for that he should be commended. Hitler is seen as blustering and Chaplin hilariously lampoons his overheated style, practically spitting into the front row so overwrought does he become. The speeches are comic gems because of his use of pseudo-German, some actual German, and that aforementioned overwrought style. His advisors Garbitsch (Henri Danielle) and Herring (Billy Gilbert) are oafs and psychopaths by turn. Garbitsch, obviously modelled on Goebbels, is the psychopath. Danielle chills the blood with a stark, cold depiction of a man whose quiet confidence about extermination only re-enforces the psychopathy of the Final Solution. Herring is an oaf who can do nothing without making a fool of himself. By mocking Goebbels, Goerring, and Hitler so mercilessly, Chaplin gives us a release from the stress that comes from hating people.On the other hand, there are residents of the Jewish Ghetto who live fearfully owing to Naziism's escalating oppression. They have tough lives but live with dignity and self-respect. They are routinely harassed and badgered by roughneck SS officers. One day however, a chance World War I encounter between a Nazi officer and the barber brings some of the harassment to a close, at least for some time.The difference between Hitler and Mussolini on the one hand and the Ghetto residents on the other is stark, but given the horrors that Hitler and Mussolini inflicted on the world, they turn out to be prescient. There are some good performances from Paulette Goddard as a humble resident of the Ghetto, and Reginald Gardiner as an informal leader in the community. They bring humility and decency to their characters.As usual, Chaplin's comic gifts shine through in set pieces. In this film, the set piece of Chaplin hanging from the wing of a moving plane is hilarious. Another hilarious scene is that of a bumbling crew messing up the debut of a new weapon. Neither shoe might hold up to the famous shoe eating in ""Gold Rush"" but they are worthwhile rivals.The film comes to a head as the Ghetto barber as well as arrogant dictator Hinkle (both played by Chaplin) are mistaken for one another. The humble barber must address an assembly of Hinkle's most brainwashed followers and the unexpected speech leaves the crowd shocked.As a statement opposing authoritarians it is very powerful movie. It is a pity more artists haven't used their power to condemn authoritarianism. It is a bit pie in the sky but at the time, the Final Solution hadn't yet happened and so what we see in retrospect was not inevitable. Chaplin's movie offered the world a beautiful vision of the future, but if idealism isn't expressed, it doesn't even stand a chance. Chaplin showed his cards and stuck his neck out and as I said, I have a lot of respect for Chaplin making a movie that was obviously deeply felt. It might not have happened but it's a beautiful, as well as very funny, vision to aspire toward."
Kat-50,"Dec 29, 1998",N/A,"Possibly one of the most brilliant movies of all time. It shows the work of a comic genius (Charlie Chaplin) as well as an incredibly political insight. This film was panned and saw Chaplin labeled communist. Then after the start of WW2 Chaplin became a genius once again, overnight. Its message, although nearly 60 years old, still rings true in its plea for the end to war. The best political satire ever to be aimed at Hitler. 10/10!!!"
brijfuchs,"Oct 3, 2022",7/10,"The Great Dictator is a comedy written, directed, and performed by Charlie Chaplin. It was released in theaters in 1940. The movie presents a dictator named Adenoid Hynkel, starring Charlie Chaplin, who is trying to expand his empire while enforcing racism against Jews. A Jewish Barber, also played by Charlie Chaplin, and a women named Hannah, starring Paulette Goddard, rebels against the oppression of the storm trooper movement. As Hynkel wants to take on more land to conquer, his rival Napaloni Dictator of Bacteria, played by Jack Oakie, makes moves to gain more land for his dictatorship too.This film pokes fun of the uprising of Adolf Hitler and the fascist Nazi movement while trying to send a message to the audience. It shows the oppression of the Jews from the brutal storm troopers. While it is extremely hard to make a comedic film about recent horrible events, Charlie Chaplin was quite successful at putting the whole movie together as well as his speech to the world at the time. Chaplin also used many film techniques such as rear projection and miniatures.I found this film similar to Do The Right Thing by Spike Lee. They both talk about the social injustices of oppression from a different race. For the Great Dictator it describes the political and social issues of the storm trooper movement and a Hynkel rising to a higher level of dictatorship. Some of the Jews such as the barber and Hannah rebel by smacking the storm troopers with a pan and other objects such as a paint brush. In Do the Right Thing there is racism everywhere from all sides. Most of the racism is mostly verbal until a fight breaks out in a small pizza shop where the police officers were called, and police officers killed one of African Americans on purpose. This started a big riot. Both movies also deal with authority brutality. Police brutality and racism against the African Americans in Do The Right Thing and in the Great Dictator the storm troopers abused their power against the Jews.I personally did like the movie quite a lot. I loved both Chaplin's characters. Both played extremely well. The Jewish Barber and Dictator Hynkel are opposites of personality. Hynkel wants to rule the world while causing violence towards Jews and the Barber wants freedom and universal love. I thought it was smart for Chaplin to use rear projection and miniatures for the movie. I did not find it extremely funny, but some scenes did make me smile even though the movie is about a serious topic of the fascist Nazi movement. I really liked how some of the characters would also talk directly to the audience about the serious issues that needed to be discussed. Overall, I would recommend this movie to watch for small moments of smiles and the storyline of both Chaplin's characters."

Vartiainen,"Jan 13, 2019",6/10,"Charlie Chaplin was one of the great masters of the silent film. Even though Hollywood had moved to talkies in the late 20s, it would take Chaplin almost two decades to do the same with this film. The Great Dictator was filmed as a criticism against the oppression of the Jews rampant in Germany at the time. Chaplin plays a dual role as both Adenoid Hynkel, the megalomaniac dictator of the proud nation of Tomainia, and as a Jewish barber who lost his memory during World War One, and who's return home is soured by the marching stormtroopers.The film was a huge hit upon its release. And why not. If nothing else, it's brilliant propaganda against the onslaught of Nazism. That being said, I'm not personally all that impressed by it.The biggest problem I see with the film is the fact that Chaplin is still so clearly tied to his roots in silent film. The film is more of a collection of sketches than a proper story. Many of these sketches have no dialogue, being nothing more than an excuse for Chaplin to prance around, showing off his athletic skills and funny expressions.Not to say there's no content or depth to be found. The film's message against oppression is a strong one and whenever the film takes time out of Chaplin's prancing to tell a story, it tells it well. And the final speech at the end given by the barber is very powerful, speaking of hope and the triumph of good will over evil.If only the rest of the film could have been like that.But that the biggest flaw with Chaplin. His movies are rather alike and he's very fond of his tricks and mannerisms. The Great Dictator is an important film historically, but as a modern cinema experience it leaves a lot to be desired."
hemant_balz,"Mar 15, 2010",10/10,"The great dictator,the ruler of Tomania,this is not the real Hitler but Charlie Chaplin in the role of the Hynkel himself.Satirical performance by one of the true legends Charlie Chaplin.Paulette Goddard as Hanna is a revelation.Her beauty shines throughout even in the black/white scenes.She looks so charming.This masterpiece movie has a great comedy effect with good moral to go along with it.The casting is pretty much good with every actor giving their best.The Jewish barber as Hynkel.Comedy of errors.And not to forget the great speech in the end.The movie turns to a moral sense after this speech & the speech is very captivating.I still remember the last lines: Jewish Barber: ""Look up, Hannah! The soul of man has been given wings and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow! Into the light of hope, into the future! The glorious future, that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. Look up!"". Memorable speech & memorable ending.Great movie to watch."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"Jun 28, 2020",9/10,"The Great Dictator (1940) :
Brief Review -SPEECHLESS ! Charlie Chaplin speaks for the First Time and Breaks the Silence on the Biggest Issue of Humanity of it's time. I had to pinch myself to make sure that yes, a film like The Great Dictator was made in 1940 when World was going through one of the toughest period in the history of humanity contretemps. World War II abolished the lives of many innocent people and the Dictator who made it happen didn't even care about it for once. Charlie Chaplin was making popular Comedy film in Silent mode then but then he took the right opportunity to make his first true sound film to break the silence on anti-semitism, fascism and Dictatorship. The film has a very interesting plot surrounding World War II affected zones and of course with fictional changes but one can clearly guess what it is and whom it is all about. Hitler was raging against Jewish community and at the same time legend Chaplin made this film which seems Unbelievable! Just like his other his films he added his trademark comedy and funny moments to keep people entertained for 2 hours but then in last 5 Minutes he went berserk over an Important social message on humanity, equality and peace. That's what the world needed at that time. The trick of exchanging characters of The Dictator and a Jewish Victim (both played by Charlie Chaplin) was so clever and effective. Many scenes and dialogues by supporting characters on the inequitableness and conformity of humans were enough to give Goosebumps. Acting by Charlie Chaplin was outstanding and probably one of his career's best. Rest of the cast was fantastic too. Screenplay, cinematography, Background Score were Good enough and suitable. Overall, The Great Dictator is truly by all 'A Great Film' and indeed The Most Socially Important and Effective film of Charlie Chaplin's incredible filmography. A MASTERPIECE !RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest"

baransel-vickers,"Sep 8, 2020",9/10,"From the start; to end of this 2 hour picture I went from laughter to tears on multiple occasions. This is truly a masterpiece of a political statement disguised as a comedy, unsurprisingly the visual humor is its strongest point.The only criticism I have of this film is the ending, it seems rushed but the speech by Charlie Chaplin makes up for it undoubtedly.May all of you that haven't watched this unite and go on this wonderful adventure."
v_kumar3@yahoo.com,"Jun 11, 2021",8/10,"Understanding black and white is not easy, but considering that this was made in1940, we have to be more considerate. Chaplin is a dictator as also a barber.this is called a double role.the gags are there and the pace moves along. Chaplin in a coffin. That's something ! A must watch,even after so many years."
CinemaClown,"Sep 2, 2013",N/A,"The first all-talkie, all-sound film from Charlie Chaplin is also the most controversial work of his filmmaking career that presents the revered icon making fun of all things fascism and is a blatant parody of Adolf Hitler & his propaganda. An overly political film from Chaplin, The Great Dictator is considered a classic today but of all the feature-length films that I've seen of his so far, it's also the weakest.Set 20 years after the First World War in the fictional country of Tomainia which was on the losing side, The Great Dictator follows two story lines; first concerning a Jewish barber who suffered memory loss during his service in the war & finds himself under a new oppression after returning home while the other storyline concerns Tomainia's ruthless dictator who is trying to expand his empire.Written, produced, directed & scored by Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator marks his first stint with sound cinema yet Chaplin shows a great level of comfort in what's an unfamiliar territory for him. The timeless elements of his silent classics are present in this picture but Chaplin also employs sound in a manner that adds more weight to his already unparalleled slapstick humour, as evident in Hynkel's speech.The film is usually at its best when there is no dialogue needed or when the spoken words don't make any sense. Chaplin absolutely nails the character of Adenoid Hynkel; the Dictator of Tomainia, and whatever gibberish comes out of his mouth is pure gold. And he's excellently supported by Jack Oakie, who plays Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Benito Mussolini) & they together provide the viewers with the film's finest moments.The technical aspects are refined to the smallest of details, as always the case in most films by Chaplin. The sets are impressive to look at, Camera-work is expertly carried out with long takes, controlled movements & sharp focus. Editing is a slight mishap for some sequences linger on for too long or become repetitive. Humour carries Chaplin's unique trademark but there are a few empty stretches in between. As for the soundtrack, it simply fits.Chaplin also plays the Jewish barber in addition to the dictator and is excellent in that part as well. While the barber character does borrow a few elements from The Little Tramp, it's Hynkel where Chaplin really shines this time. However, what brings the film down for me is what was absent from his earlier features; the voice-over, as Chaplin's narration is annoying & intruding at times, especially when he tries to explain what Hynkel is saying in his gibberish speech.On an overall scale, The Great Dictator may not be as remarkable as Chaplin's finest films but it nonetheless works as an audacious piece of political satire that's superbly filmed & outstandingly performed. It offers an enjoyable ride for the most part, features plenty of amusing moments but lacks the smooth flow & closely-knitted structure of his usual works and although the universal message of the final speech does transcend all races, borders & boundaries, it can also feel a bit preachy. Either way, The Great Dictator comes recommended."
jzappa,"Oct 28, 2011",8/10,"Gambling with the set-in-stone Chaplin character developed over decades was daring, and it could backfire any time. The film's climactic sermon, for instance, spills over of schmaltz. When a dictator's imposter nervously approaches the loudspeakers, then starts to talk, Chaplin himself is inexplicably bootlegged into the story. He condemns repression and eulogizing social equality, but it collapses the farce and ends the movie as a lecture, followed by swelling music. It's terminal when Chaplin suddenly retunes the movie's strings, which might've been his purpose for making it.Chaplin speaks straight at us, in his own voice. No comic relief. Even as Chaplin acknowledges and utilizes sound's potential here, he reminds us of the more real assets of silence. For instance, Dictator Hynkel spurts a lengthy sentence to his typist, who hits a couple of letters. He bids a split-second expletive, and she types for numerous lines, tolling the carriage return. He's speaking pseudo-German, basically discontinuous coughs and stammers, with intermittent words like ""cheese 'n' crackers"" and ""Katzenjammer kids."" When a pen won't abandon its holder, in exasperation it's just repetitive, abusive English. Sound mostly is just ineffective rage.There are other German terms that reappear among the claptraplike Juden. He's particularly keen on shouting these words, his face cramming the screen like Melanie Laurent's vengeful big-screen visage in Inglourious Basterds. Hynkel doesn't like brunettes either, but his counselor proposes pursuing Jews first. Then he can handle the brunettes and govern an entirely blonde world, himself the sole dark-haired individual around. He's so delighted by this, he waltzes with a bouncing globe to Wagner's strings. It's pure Chaplin, simultaneously fluid and silly. The nonchalant intermingling of terror and absurdity here and elsewhere is disturbing. It's not always hilarious and wasn't meant to be, but the celebrated gags and wealth of comic pantomime here are all indelible, a translation of the world into burlesque.Watching Chaplin's simulations of losing physical control, he appears to be truly collapsing into inopportune objects and people, but with accomplished, athletic poise. But it's not spoof or derogatory commentary. It's also not just the idea that totalitarianism can be deposed with hilarity. It's also the idea that anyone can be a fool. And the disconcerting result of Chaplin's becoming Hynkel is that he gives him some of his own charm. Hynkel doesn't actually dictate so much as take counsel, fantasize, love himself, throw tantrums. He's too timid and persistently uncomfortable around the sunny, unsubtle Napaloni.Chaplin relegates world history to a string of acts and caricatures sponged from his own work. The Gestapo are adaptations of the big bully who'd been chasing his Tramp since his dawn period. The Jews communally befit a Tramp variation, tender, crafty and reasonable in a mad world. Paulette Goddard reprises her enchanting urchin, but she's not so innocent here, with an enormous amount of rugged sex appeal. It's not much of a riposte to Nazism's upsurge. But Chaplin was up to something else. Ultimately, the Nazis aren't condensed into comic-strip clowns, but elevated to a much broader human madness.The movie's charm rests on the link Chaplin draws between the little guy and the oppressor. The brutes chasing Chaplin as prey are under the auspices of Chaplin the predator. He's his own tormenter and the voice of defiance against his own madness. The casting keeps tying what its plot undoes. The barber momentarily wielding a razor over someone's throat seems more threatening than Hynkel ever does. Hynkel in his demure moments essentially acts like the barber. In the climactic sermon, Chaplin begins to tirade like Hynkel. Wrath with good intentions is still wrath. He attacks the dictator in everybody, and his equating of oppressor and oppressed not only suggests that the clown could've been the evildoer but that even the good and the victimized, characterized by the world's favorite clown, aren't to be entrusted with such power. Chaplin's best extra hint, having made his authoritarian silly, is to evoke how much destruction even silly folk can cause."
cintronnayeli,"Oct 9, 2024",7/10,"Charlie Chaplin was a known director who released the film The Great Dictator in 1940. This movie is a satire comedy that opposes fascism and dictatorships. Chaplin portrays both the oppressive monarch, and the Jewish barber, who is misidentified.The film is well known for its sarcasm and timeless themes of freedom, humanism, and the fight against injustice. Chaplin's sad moments and physical humor combine to create a dramatic contrast that emphasizes the ridiculousness of authoritarianism. The well-known speech promotes compassion and separation is especially touching to all viewers.Chaplin's skill as a director is demonstrated by his ability to combine humor and a serious message, elevating this movie above a simple comedy to a powerful political statement. If anyone is interested in social criticism or cinema history, they should definitely see it.This movie was shot in black and white was since it was released in the year of 1940, when color filming was more rare and non color filming was more affordable. Due to budgetary constraints, technological constraints, and director preferences, a large number of movies from that era were more commonly made in black and white.While they approach these subjects from distinct historical and cultural settings, Spike Lee's 1989 film ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""The Great Dictator"" both address themes of social justice, oppression, and the struggle against power. Director Chaplin highlights the value of empathy, solidarity, and defiance against dictatorship in The Great Dictator. In its farewell speech, the movie urges people to unite against injustice in favor of a society where compassion rules over separation.Both movies encourage audiences to speak out against injustice and support reform. ""Do the Right Thing"" highlights the value of community and understanding in resolving racial conflicts, while ""The Great Dictator"" focuses on the struggle against authoritarianism. In the end, both movies emphasize the necessity for people to confront authority in all of its forms and inspire compassion and engagement."
ecadvocate,"Dec 30, 2021",5/10,"Some good film making, acting, etc. But if you already know everything about the war, the story is predictable, frustratingly untimely and the movie will seem like too little too late. If it had been made in 1938 it would have been more timely. There is no time capsule value for those who already know. Great propaganda though."
PCC0921,"Jan 10, 2021",8/10,"Like Duck Soup (1933), before it and Dr. Strangelove (1964), after it, this film received all kinds of pro and con criticisms all over the world, about its questionable content and that is a good thing. The interesting part of the evolution of this film was the fact that shooting began in 1937, but as times and history changed over a three year period some of those same pros had become cons and vice-versa. It was also Chaplin's first full-audio, full-talking film. Regardless, the film is ahead of its time. It did touch on many sensibilities and it did create a fervor of backlashThe comedy seemed a little stiff and forced, but the point is there. Chaplin claims, when he began making this film, that he didn't really know much about the extent of the terrible atrocities that the Nazis had done and felt all he really was doing was making fun of a really bad guy. You can definitely see how good of a craftsman Chaplin was with his filmmaking and you can see how painstakingly it was for him to put together a movie that took over three years to finish.This may have been a problem too, considering the 125 minute run time does bring on the drag a little, but, all in all, an excellent addition to the history of film and to the world. The pay-off comes at the end of the movie, when we get to see Chaplin's famous and amazing ending speech, which sent shivers down my spine.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB"
cartesianthought,"May 24, 2016",8/10,"I find the comedy bits hilarious, in spite of the fact that it's a Nazi holocaust film, and I find the dramatic bits terrifying, in spite of this being a parody.Alternating between Chaplin the dictator and Chaplin the Jewish barber shop owner keeps this film at an energetic up and down pace. The third act is sillier than I would have expected it to be, and in some ways it is anti-climactic, but the speech at the end is very beautiful and satisfying.It's unsettling and Chaplin himself regrets making this film, but this film serves as a window toward how people viewed Hitler before the extent of his actions was revealed. It's hard not to extrapolate that death camps are the next step after the persecution of Jews, but hindsight is 20-20."
sumathyramesh-92949,"Mar 3, 2023",10/10,"I have never been much of a Charlie Chaplin fan; born and bred in the cinema era where audio had been well integrated into the artform, the visuals, the dialogues and the music augmenting and enhancing each other to established heights in mass communication of the producer's intent, tI didn't have the maturity to seek out silent movies. I also didn't know Charlie Chaplin made non-silent movies- until yesterday when I chanced on it in the oscars-category of one of our free-to-air on-demand-channels choosing to exercises my every nerve fibre while my husband was engaged in a, let us say, limited form of exercise, choosing to sweat out to the instructions of an online yoga teacher. My nerve are still quivering from the impact of the opening scene where a humble barber-turned a overnight front-liner on the theatre of war leans on his humour to plough through the moment, as his line of command hands down one weapon/control of a war-equipment that he barely understood, let alone had the mastery to deploy.And I still have some hundred odd minutes to chew."
nikomarcussen,"Apr 2, 2017",10/10,"This is Chaplin's best movie in my opinion. The Great Dictator is a great comedic drama, with some excellent universal messages, which is delivered in the best ever speech on the silver screen. It is without a doubt one of the best satirical movies I have seen, and the themes the movie deals with is still relevant to this day. This movie is an immortal classic!"
manuel-pestalozzi,"Feb 13, 2004",N/A,"Chaplin's movies are not really in my line, but with The Great Dictator he has earned my everlasting respect and my great admiration. When watching this movie one should remember that the people parodied in it were at the time of its release very, very much in power and that they had powerful friends in all countries. Yes, it must have been a tremendously courageous act. Mr Chaplin risked his name and possibly large parts of his wealth by doing The Great Dictator and I believe that it was honestly made out of idealism.The use of sound is outstanding. The ideas for it seem to come from the silent era: careful, very good choice of musical scores, the creation of funny situations by special sound effects. The dialogs are wooden, there is hardly any really meaningful exchange. But then there are Chaplin's monologs. His imitation of the German language is funny and at the same time chilling. Amazing how well he caught the rhythm and speech-pattern of that foreign tongue  I guess for him it was all a kind of music.In a strange way Chaplin reveals himself to be an Englishman at heart. The use of sound in The Great Dictator reminded me strongly of British Comedies from the Ealing Studios, the Goons show, Monty Python. Somehow they all seem to stand in the same cultural tradition. It was just amazing to hear how English his voice sounds when he makes his final speech (and who had heard Chaplin talk before?). The speech really comes from the heart and is very powerful and moving. It is a strange internationalistic frontal attack against modernism as a whole, the very economical eruption he owed his wealth and popularity to. Just compare it with a song of his compatriot: John Lennon's Imagine.There may be flaws in this movie (the beginning is confusing, Paulette Goddard seems somewhat lost, the storyline is sketchy), but the terrific performance of Chaplin  who even had the greatness to let himself play literally against the wall by a fellow comedian: Jack Oakie as Benzino Napaloni  more than compensates for them. It's wonderful to watch Charlie move. Such elegance and agility! And he was over fifty, the same age as Adolf Hitler."
jgcorrea,"Apr 20, 2021",7/10,"Europe was at war in 1940. So few European pictures dated 1940 are still of interest. Let's say Max Ophuls' De Mayerling à Sarajevo, Vittorio De Sica's Maddalena... zero in condotta, Willi Forst's Operette and Veit Harlan's infamous Jud Sus are rentable. Augusto Genina's L'assedio dell'Alcazar is very dated today. But the English productions (The thief of Bagdad, Gaslight, Night train to Munich, The stars look down) withstood time well enough. In Brazil, Humberto Mauro directed Argila (still very watchable). Hollywood was extremely active. I recommend especially Hitchcock's Rebecca, and Disney's Fantasia. Very partially I recommend Chaplin's Dictator because of two gags: Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon, and the Jewish barber shaving a man while fitting to Brahms' #5 Hungarian Dance."
adrianovasconcelos,"May 9, 2024",7/10,"Charlie Chaplin, one of the great movie makers of the 20th Century, had the foresight to portray Hitler early in WWII (1940) so accurately that the latter put a price on Chaplin's head. Most remarkable how hardly a year after WWII had begun, with the Holocaust still at a naissant stage, Chaplin already had a very clear idea of the horrors the Third Reich was visiting on the semitic population.Great sequences involving Hynkel (thinly disguised Hitler both phonetically and visually) include his play with a globe until it bursts in his face, his speech in a bogus language to an applauding crowd reminiscent of Riefenstahl's documentary crowds, and, needless to say, the magnificent sequence between Hynkel and Napaloni (Mussolini), each constantly trying to upstage the other.Marred by excessive dialogue, Chaplin's portrayal of the civilian Jewish barber is far less effective and attention-grabbing than that of Hynkel. Chaplin's rather moralistic speech at the end is far less effective than Hynkel's grunting, raving tirades, and imperial gestures.THE GREAT DICTATOR suffers from overlength and somewhat repetitive comic routines, and Chaplin does not appear to be at ease with sound pics. To me, it marks the beginning of a chute for Chaplin in terms of quality, even though he would still churn out a masterpiece, LIMELIGHT (1952), and good efforts like M. VERDOUX and KING IN NEW YORK.All told, it still makes for necessary viewing for anyone really interested in cinema. 7/10."
jrgrfg,"May 9, 2020",10/10,No doubt one of the greatest films of all time. The fact that Charles Chaplin released this film in 1940 at the peak of Hitler's dominance and with most nations' in the world still bending the knee to the horrors of the Third Reich is a testament to the valor and veracity of Charles Chaplin. Despite being released 80 years ago this movie is and will sadly forever remain relevant.
Ben-Hibburd,"Jun 29, 2017",9/10,"The Great Dictator Is written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. It also sees him play duel roles. In the primary role he plays Dictator Adenoid Hynkel of a fictional country called Tomainia. Who over the course of the film tries to expand his empire by trying to borrow money from a Jewish banker In order to Invade his neighbouring country of Osterlich. After being refused the loan he orders the purge of Jewish community which was already being subjugated under his orders.Chaplins second role Is juxtaposed against Hynkel, he plays a Jewish barber(his name is never given) and Is a WW1 veteran. Who In the process of saving the life of a wounded pilot, loses his own memory. Twenty years later returns to the ghetto where he falls In love with Hannah(Paulette Goddard), and tries to go back to being a barber. However after being constantly harassed by Hynkels stormtroopers, finds himself on the run.The set up and story of this film is fairly basic, and offers no surprises, but the film never Intends to. Instead this Is a platform for Chaplin to voice a larger message. The film was made In 1940, at the time the USA hadn't entered the war yet. Whilst the horrors and persecution of the Jewish people hadn't been fully realised yet at that point In time. If It had of been know, I think this would've been a very different film, It probably wouldn't of even been made.This if one of only a couple of films In which Chaplin spoke In, and It's this reason why the film feels more powerful then It would've been had someone else starred In It. This is personified In what many people would agree to be the finest speech In film history at the end of the film. The last five minutes of the film are by far and away the most famous aspect of the film, and for good reason. It's a rousing and profound speech, that comes straight from Chaplins heart. It's a speech that speaks too the very goodness of humanity. It's also made all the more effective coming from a man known for his silence.Whilst the last few minutes of the film has a very serious tone and message. The film contains the usual levity and slapstick humour that Is associated with Chaplins work. There are many moments of excellent satire peppered all throughout the film. my personal favourite being when the Barber meets up with the pilot he saved twenty years later(Schultz). Schultz saves him from being taken by the Stormtroopers. He says to the barber ""Strange, and I always thought of you as an Aryan"" To which Chaplins barber responds ""I'm a vegetarian"" In a deadpan manner. There are a few jokes that do feel a little dated. The majority however hit their mark, and feel fresh and contemporary In todays current climate.The Great Dictator came out at an Important time not just film history, but human history. Whilst some of the satire Is a little too on the nose. The film did what it needed too do with flying colours, It's a beautiful film to watch and the editing and direction is on point. The Great Dictator maybe arguably one of the most important films ever made. It's a film that everyone should watch at-least once In their life-time."
Nemesis42,"Oct 30, 2010",10/10,"Absolutely brilliant satire! We laughed until we were upside down in parts of the film. The comic genius of the film maker shines here. Strong humor, justified attacks at the fascists, belittling Hitler and friends, incredible scenes, appropriate commentary on war and peace, beautiful humanity, anti-establishment.If anyone does not 'get' something positive from this film they were either were not concentrating or they must see the world through miserable eyes indeed.One of the funniest things you will ever witness. It moves slowly in places but its nice to see something with such a wild narrative structure as this, like a car going fast then slow then fast then faster then slow then fast...etc. Many 'hollywood' blockbusters have much more irritating slow romantic interludes than this does.Do your self a favor, grab a copy of this, sit back preferably with a good friend or two whom you enjoy a laugh with, and you will have chest pains from the bellowing!!"
davidgkimberley,"Jan 17, 2012",10/10,"Though I am ashamed to admit it, this is in fact the only Chaplin film I have (so far) seen. This film absolutely stunned me, Chaplin, wrote, directed, produced and played the lead role in 'The Great Dictator' and dear god did he do a good job.In terms of acting, Chaplin is just unbelievable. There is an incredible combination of silent and spoken performance, and it evokes both extreme laughter and sadness. One can easily the remnants of his silent career in this and his mannerisms, his physical acting is hilarious. The speech at the end of the film is probably the best I've ever seen in any film, his delivery is just incredible, its thought provoking and full of emotion. Chaplin is just the absolute maestro some of the clowns who perform nowadays should most definitely take heed, individually I've never seen a comic performance or dramatic performance that good, but together, its left me speechless, I actually can't convey how good he was in words.Script wise, its again just fantastic. The characters' names to start with are hilarious (herring and garbage being my favourite) whilst the absolute nonsense he spouts when speaking German is also very good. There is also silliness but with such close attention to detail, most notably, I thought, was checking his tie in the bald man's shining head or the ridiculous moments where he goes into to be sculpted or painted before dashing out again a few seconds later. The speech at the end is legendary. This is quite seriously worthy of some great politician and its deliverance, as I have said, was outstanding.I can't really think of anything else to say and I actually feel as though I haven't even nearly done justice to this piece of cinema. It must go down as one of the greatest films ever made."
golcal,"Jun 3, 2021",9/10,"A film that manages to hold our attention from beginning to end. Chaplin manages to make a great transition between the two characters, the Jew and the Dictator, he does it in a way that makes each of the characters unique with their own personal characteristics. The conflict of the plot is very well worked, and in the famous part of the speech, everything is done sincerely by the writer and actor Charles Chaplin.Um filme que consegue prender a nossa atenção do inicio ao fim. Chaplin consegue fazer uma ótima transição entre os dois personagens, o judeu e o ditador, ele faz de uma maneira que torna cada um dos personagens únicos com suas caracteriticas pessoais. O conflito da trama é muito bem trabalhado, e na famosa parte do dicurso, tudo é feito de maneira sincera pelo escritor e ator Charles Chaplin."
M-8,"Oct 31, 1998",N/A,"If Mr. Charlie Chaplin, greatest figure in movie history, abandoned silent films with ""The Great Dictator"", not to worry: we will stop talking for him. His fantastic portrayal and satiric costume of Nazi Germany has made me (and others I hope) speechless with such genius for art and lirism. A gift for all mankind and a manifesto against hatred, ""The Great Dictator"" is one of the great movies of all time. Along with most of Chaplin's."
hongdao,"Feb 20, 2017",10/10,"Charles Chaplin is well known for his silent movies, with The great dictator to be one of his first sound movies. He stepped out of his comfort zone. At an area of Hollywood where political stances are forbidden to be shown in productions, he took a stand.He broke the 4th wall, and utilized his traditional popular 'Tramp' persona. All for this movie, debuted 1940. It is a declaration of war on the breech of human rights, horrendous act and discrimination. It was a time which Nazi Germany is at the prime of their power, and the Ally forces, which was then only recently established, had suffered numerous defeats in the European ground even world wide. Fair is to say that, at the year 1940, there were quite a few signs that Nazi German would ascend to world domination.He had nothing to gain from making this movie at that time, and everything to lose, he could face a disastrous controversy and be black listed for all his work. He could be jobless, homeless and on the run for the rest of time. But he made this satirical movie as his stance toward the atrocities committed by the actual dictators of the world. He put his life on the line.It is easy for us to condemn Hitler and Nazi Fascists now. It is easy for us to speak up against them or write papers, novels and films about that matter. Will you still have done it, in 1940? Will you? He did.It isn't a perfect movie production, limited perhaps by time and by technology. But the Actors and Actresses were fantastic. and It deserves a perfect vote for their outstanding performances and the plot. It has no special effects, yet it echoed through a century.His final speech in the movie, albeit controversy is what I view as one of the finest moments in movie history. He spoke to his audiences, millions around the world, in those few minutes. His true passion, conveyed in a fashion that mimics (satirically) Hitler's speech pattern, has reached their souls.I recommend that everyone should watch this movie again, given the political turmoil around the world recently, and remember what this movie, the history and the great men and women fought for our freedom have tried teaching us."
mildpanyut,"Dec 21, 2019",10/10,"The world in 1940 was a different place. Fascism was on the rise and no one thought that it was a threat to world peace. Chaplin chose anti-fascism and anti-racism as the themes of his first talking film, a move that was at odd with the public sentiment of the time or, at least, of the United States, which was trying to maintain neutrality during World War II. Despite opposition from some people, Chaplin proceeded with the film's production. This film excellently uses humor to satirize totalitarianism and militarism of Nazi Germany. I really love the scene where Field Marshal Herring rushed in to inform the Great Leader of the discovery of ""the most wonderful, the most marvelous poisonous gas"" and further enthusiastically stated that ""It will kill everybody"". The film also highlight the persecution of Jewish people fueled by irrational racism and the hunger for power of the Nazis. The most memorable moment of the film is surely the final speech by the Jewish Barber. Chaplin did it with such a passion that almost everyone will be captivated by the speech. The call for peace, cooperation and democracy in the speech is still relevant to these days. And that is unfortunate because that means the problems pointed out in the film still exist in the present day although may be not as severe as in the past."
kramachandran,"Nov 13, 2013",10/10,"This movie is way ahead of its times.Chaplin's initial foray into sound films and what an inauguration! Call it a start with a bang. The final speech by the Jewish barber is the crowning glory of this movie. The greatest words ever spoken and ever heard by the human species. The collective aspirations of humanity through the ages crystallized into a wonderful speech, is sure to render one speechless. A speech that is a judgment and an indictment of all that has gone wrong in the world.The movie is a spoof on Hitler and his Nazi party. The insanity of his times and the helplessness of the people in the face of such evil, makes this movie even more ominous. A speech that seeks to chart out the future course of human progress, only if humanity and her uncaring leaders care to listen."
marcoeliarighi,"Jul 28, 2020",10/10,"I was appalled of the handful of 1 star rewiews that say that this movie is not suitable for modern audiences. For the first time, Chaplin goes ""talkie"", and he does it to send a powerful message (A.KA. the last minutes of the film, this is a spoiler free rewiew!), that appeals even in this century, if not more. He takes apart piece by piece the senselessness of Hitler and Mussolini's ideology by making them a caricature, but closer than you think to the reality of the time. He then makes a joke of the little people that circle around the Dictator (the fat general that tries to tighten his belt, the reckless military scientists, the Tomanian war hero, to name a few) but, in doing so captures their essence in just a few memorable scenes. The only inaccurate portrayal is that of the concentration camps, seen more as prisons than extermination camps, but remember: this film is from 1940, so it makes for a bold statement against all the totalitarian regimes while they were at their peak while giving the free world a picture filled with Hope."
rahulbharadwaja,"Mar 18, 2019",9/10,A satire on all the megalomaniacs. Wonderful take by Charlie and relevant even today in most parts of the world.
TBoldOne,"Dec 21, 2010",10/10,"Wow, what a movie. Other reviewers have covered technical details, including favorite scenes and some minor shortcomings. Consider the following 1) The movie was made in 1940, when the US was blatantly isolationist. 2) The movie predicts that ""Hitler"" wants to kill all the Jews. 3) The movie alternately portrays ""Hitler"", as a genius and a buffoon, which he was. 4) This was Chaplin's first foray into talkies. How he adapted to the new medium is remarkable. 5) The speech at the end is a plea/wake up call to the world to act. Of course the world basically does nothing until it's almost too late.Finally when watching this movie say to yourself, It's 1940, how did he know? It's 1940, how did he know he wants to kill all the Jews ? He must know there will be a death sentence on his head. It's 1940, how could he predict the future?On a tragic note. How did the US pay him back for his warning about Nazism? It in effect deports him 6 years after WWII ends in the madness of McCarthyism.One of those movies you should see if you like movies. Brilliant, scary, and unbelievably prescient."
makain,"Nov 24, 2004",N/A,"The beginning 5 or 10 minutes of this movie contain some of the funniest scenes I can ever remember seeing in any film (except from Chaplin's silent short feature, ""Pay Day"") - I laughed out loud and so hard, I cried, I thought it was so funny. The remainder of the movie is, of course, typically clever, the humor more low key and very Chaplin-ish. When I first saw it (which is fairly recently), I was quite surprised that it was his first ""talkie"" - naturally being used to his silent films, I was quite pleasantly surprised by his pleasing voice and that he didn't move to sound earlier. Charlie Chaplin will always remain my favorite performer/artist/director/comic - The Little Tramp."
cmtenasitas,"Apr 7, 2025",9/10,"To make a satire of history's greatest murderer and dictator, right at the moment when his power and influence were at their peak, is something totally unrepeatable, in my opinion. Because it's not that he makes a small sarcastic comment or just a little joke, what he does is a total mockery of the person and his ideals. Although I must be honest and say that the second hour of the film, as the minutes pass, begins to decline in a rather problematic way, and when it shines the least, it ends with one of the best, if not the best, speeches in a movie. Could it have been more complete as a movie itself? Of course, but it's a detail compared to all its virtues."
r-48240,"May 10, 2020",10/10,"Chaplin says: comedy uses vision, tragedy uses closeness. Chaplin's body language is far greater than facial expressions. The final anti-mudicrous tone ends with a serious, atmospheric speech. Unexpected."
kaaffilm,"Mar 28, 2023",10/10,"A Masterful Satire on Fascism and a Timeless Classic""Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" is a masterful satire on fascism that remains relevant and powerful to this day. Released in 1940, the film tells the story of a Jewish barber (also played by Chaplin) who is mistaken for the dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel, and ends up leading a rebellion against the oppressive regime.Chaplin's performance as both the barber and Hynkel is a tour-de-force, showcasing his remarkable talent for physical comedy as well as his ability to convey deep emotion. The film's iconic final speech, in which the barber speaks out against hatred and bigotry, remains one of the most powerful and moving moments in cinema history.Beyond its performances, ""The Great Dictator"" is a technical marvel, featuring stunning black-and-white cinematography and innovative use of sound. The film's score, composed by Chaplin himself, is particularly memorable, and the way it interacts with the action on screen is nothing short of brilliant.What makes ""The Great Dictator"" truly remarkable, however, is its message. By using humor and satire to expose the evils of fascism, Chaplin created a film that is both entertaining and deeply thought-provoking. Even today, more than 80 years after its release, the film's themes of tolerance, freedom, and equality are as relevant as ever.In short, ""The Great Dictator"" is a timeless classic that deserves to be seen and appreciated by audiences of all ages. Chaplin's masterful direction and performance, combined with the film's technical excellence and powerful message, make it one of the greatest films of all time."
DonaldDooD,"Jul 31, 2014",8/10,"The Great Dictator is famous for its final speech. Dubbed by many as ""The Greatest Speech Ever Made"", Charlie Chaplin puts all his soul into his defense of liberty and human progress. Indeed, I've never heard any speech feel so passionate, yet so genuine. If you don't watch this film, you should at least listen to that. Its easy to find on YouTube.As for the rest of the film? It depends on how much you like physical comedy. Its strength doesn't lie in writing or character, but their performances. Many scenes emphasize the actor's movements and reactions. The parodies of Hitler and Mussolini often speak in foreign gibberish. Its a style common back then, but rare now, so its pretty niche. I thought it was okay - a few scenes made me chuckle, and no joke completely failed. It could have been 30 minutes shorter.I wouldn't watch this film for its satire of fascism alone. There are some good lines and scenes, but it generally lacks depth. Its far from my favorite comedy of all time, but that's personal taste. I also respect it for having more ambition and empathy for humanity than most movies back then, let alone comedies. And of course, the ending alone guarantees a respectable rating. Watch the film if you're a fan of Charlie Chaplin or The Three Stooges, and watch the final scene regardless of your opinions."
darrellrontuffs,"Dec 28, 2013",9/10,"For being made at the very hight of World War 2, The Great Dictator is an extremely brave film. It could have only been made if enough passion and commitment was present to see it through. Luckily for us, Chaplin had this and so much more. He was sure he could make a film for the people of the world and those suffering from the chaos of the war. Chaplin set out to make fun of perhaps the most evil man of all time, (Adolf Hitler) an extremely hard task, but one he pulled off massively well.The Great Dictator is effective in its message even today, it seems a safe distance away from the war to make fun of Hitler and his fellow evil dictators. However, when trying to understand just how much of a risk this film was to make in 1939 it seems extraordinary. When the film was released in 1940 it was extremely successful commercially and critically, despite being banned in many countries around the world. Hitler at that time was becoming the most powerful and dangerous person in the world, millions were scared of even slightly offending him. So when a film like The Great Dictator came out, one that made Hitler look like a joke of a man, it was a huge world statement. One that stood up for all that was still good in the world.Much had been said about the similar appearances of both Chaplin and Hitler. They were two people on opposite ends of the world spectrum. They were in fact born on the same year, of the same month, in the same week. However one was a man that gave hope and laughter to millions of people around the world, and one was a monster that would be the cause of millions of innocent deaths. The Nazis even published statements about Chaplin, calling him an ""evil Jewish clown."" This was partly the reason Chaplin decided to fight back, and he did so in the way he knew best, by making one magnificent film.The Great Dictator was above all a statement of freedom and democracy at a harsh and frightening time in history. It was a lone voice at speaking out against a big bully. We see Chaplin's version of Hitler, Adenoid Hynkel constantly mess up and show himself to be a hollow and empty man. One of no love and little seriousness. As someone that just wants the entire world, nothing more, nothing less. Someone that we could only feel hatred towards and someone to be laughed at. Even as Hynkel gives an angry and aggressive speech to a huge audience he looks ridiculous. His hollow anger even results in microphones bending away from him and spinning around like cartoons. He constantly trips or is knocked over like a child by bigger people. At one point he even struggles to pull apart a plate of cooked spaghetti with his hands, showing just how weak he really is.The films cartoon portray of this Hitler-like dictator may seem wrong or even offensive to some people effected by the war. However, I feel certain people miss the point with the film. Sometimes the best way to get by in hard times is with laughter. Laughter can sometimes be the most powerful weapon humans have in this world, Chaplin understood this as he had already shown in film such as The Gold Rush or Modern Times. He connected comedy and tragedy very closely and was the master at showing how one could defeat the other. Chaplin used comedy in The Great Dictator to genius effect, and made an extremely evil man look just a little less intimidating, which was certain to have helped the spirits of millions around the world – even if just a little.One thing that was criticised in The Great Dictator was the films final speech by Chaplin. He seems to step out of his character in the film and address the world as a doppelganger of Hynkel but as Chaplin. He speaks passionately about world freedom and the bitterness of dictators, he encourages soldiers to take stand, to not be treated as machines but as men. Critics have said that this step out of character is confusing and disorientating, I think they are completely wrong. Why not end a film of such importance in a plead for freedom, why not give people hope in the human race and why not speak from your heart at such a hopeless time. The speech Chaplin gives is beautiful and passionate, love burns off his every word – even if this is at the expense of 4 minutes out of character.Asides from its message, the film is home to some well written characters and some classic slapstick set-pieces, the kind that only Chaplin could do so well. The films music is both touchingly sad and brightly comical, it is well worth watching just to hear. There are some lovely tracking shots and some wonderfully detailed set designs. The films black and white photography is beautiful to see along with its silent-era styled editing and pacing.The Great Dictator is a great place to start if you wish to explore Chaplin's filmography as a director, again he puts his heart and sole into every process of its filmmaking. Even by today's standards its message is relevant. The Great Dictator shows that sometimes the only way to battle evil in the world is to laugh at it. It may prove to not be much, however it could feel your spirit with the hope it needs to carry on."
virtueteen85,"May 16, 2006",9/10,I have to say for a man like Charlie Chaplin the role he created for himself which was a Hitlerlike character who we hated at the time ended up being one of the funniest roles he had and a very bold move to do in a time of Nazism. I say Chaplin was a true American because he has been witnessing a lot of atrocities in his time he had to show the truth of what is going with the world. He was a Jew who transported himself to America to do what he loved; performing for a crowd. Every emotion he had Chaplin put in his movies. Every problem we have in America he protested through cinema. No one should comprehend of what Chaplin in his lifetime and if anyone read his book or see any of his movies you would I am talking about.
Snow Leopard,"Oct 6, 2004",N/A,"For all that Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" was very much a topical movie in its time, it is still both entertaining and pertinent. Chaplin treats the subject of the Axis dictators with enough satirical humor and thematic depth to make it carry beyond the immediate concerns of the day. Chaplin's silent masterpieces are still his best movies, but this one shows that he was also capable of making a smooth transition to sound pictures.Chaplin himself does very well in his dual role, which gives him plenty of room to perform a good variety of material. After her excellent performance in ""Modern Times"", Paulette Goddard's role here is unfortunately much more limited, but she does well when she has a chance. Chaplin's most entertaining scenes are probably the ones with Jack Oakie, as the dictator's would-be companion in conquest. Together, the two make those scenes work both as funny satire and as a clever depiction of the dictators' fragile personas.Even if this hadn't worked so well, it would have been quite a creditable attempt by Chaplin to find humor in such a grim topic. Very few film-makers could have made a picture that hit the appropriate balance as well as this does. ""The Great Dictator"" no longer has the urgent significance that it held for its original viewers, but it retains its relevance in a more general sense. It's nearly as entertaining as Chaplin's best silents, and like them, its message still holds something worthwhile."
Horror-yo,"Jul 25, 2016",8/10,"If you know Chaplin at all by now, and by that I mean you actually have seen his full films attentively, you know he rightfully deserves the legendary status he's so widely given. The man was a genius of his own craft, and besides being a film-maker/story writer and obviously very good actor/entertainer of many fields/music composer... as a mere comic, just as a mere comic he could be hilarious in many different ways: through his nervy mimics and tricks and facial/whole body gymnastics, his interaction with surrounding props, situational comedy, coming up with ridiculous visual ideas for a scene, ridiculous concepts for a character's name or attributes, with his own voice... he was the complete entertainer/performer, and this being said not nearly in the cold academic,'accomplished artist' sort of way, but truly a creator of on-screen magic, provoker of visceral and sincere laughter, and a man whose greatest quality were in fact none of these things, but the weight of his heart and the great warmth of his humanity. All of this finds truth and application in this film in particular as he's in full-blown Chaplin mode and displays his full effect here. The famous speech this film is notorious for deserves recognition as it is in essence good while of course utopic, and although it seems the film was made for that scene they did a good job really crafting a good motion picture in itself, as a whole.Structurally the film isn't perfect, it's very good for the first 3/4s but then perhaps slows down in pace for a little while towards the end before lifting off again with that final speech. All in all, it's a great comedy. You'll find at least something funny somewhere in it, and as a film it's an entertaining, well made bit of cinema."
MehdiTaba,"Sep 6, 2022",9/10,"This film is not just a great film but a manifesto for all humanity.Charles Chaplin fearlessly spoke to the world leaders especially Hitler and Mussolini in the height of the WWII as no one else would and dare.Lots of people sold themselves and changed their minds to be able to adapt to Nazism and Fascism to just live and continue their greedy way of life but not Charles Chaplin.This is the best Charles Chaplin film ever.It's just unbelievable to see how much he was aware and informed about atrocities of German Nazi in 1938-1940- pre-production and post-production era - and what Nazism mean and what they're after.Some parts of the acting done by Chaplin in this masterpiece is just beyond excellent, like German gibberish speeches and that perfect monologue, oh, what can I say about that.Maybe, as some say, ""Perhaps the greatest monologue in film history, and possibly the most poignant recorded speech of the 20th century.""Cinematography is something great about this film which was a collaborating work of Karl Struss and Roland Totheroh.The Great Dictator was directed, written, produced, scored and starred by Charles Chaplin. Beautifully and strongly.It was a shout for help to the whole world. Some heard and some didn't and turned to ashes.It's just extraordinary that how much lots of political references in this film are still relevant and meaningful.8.5/10."
tmosest,"Jan 11, 2021",9/10,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen and the best one by Chaplin. It was surprising to see that this movie was before the US entered the war. If you like what you see in the trailer then you definitely should watch the movie. Even if you don't you still should watch this for the message at the end.
kurosawakira,"Dec 31, 2015",9/10,"Chaplin's films are like the ocean. The surface seems calm and unaltered, yet a great shift is stirring up underneath, the surface changing only when the powerful undercurrent is in full swing.So it is that ""The Great Dictator"" (1940) is a part of this sea-change that finds Chaplin on a path to the apotheosis I'd place in ""Limelight"" (1952). No longer similarly spirited like Chaplin's earlier comedies, or the middle period of the late 1920s and 1930s, Chaplin is persistently moving toward a new kind of cinema already emerging in ""Modern Times"" (1935).His transition to sound unquestionably had much to do with it. He had to let the Tramp go. Thus The Great Dictator marks a watershed in a filmography already brimming with turning points. I'd say this is where ""late Chaplin"" truly begins, Modern Times being a kind of transitory film. And as I've stated, this is not only a superficial transformation but a deeper development also in what he perceives as cinematic, funny and tragic. Surely Chaplin's films have always had that sinuously sad and dark undersong, commingled with the more apparently comical, as he was himself quick to point out,[1] yet it finds its maturity in this later period.Seeing The Great Dictator after World War II and its aftermath is like reading James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) after almost a hundred years of literary criticism and analysis. It's so pregnant with cultural meaning(s) assigned to it that it's quite impossible to watch it not through the prism of history. But I think it's important to remember that this was filmed in the late 1930s, and as Chaplin would famously muse, he had no idea of the full extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime against the jews and others.The film, then, stands in the anteroom to either history or fiction. Yet I can't help but see it as at its core as a kind of Chaplinesque fantasy, where the battle of good and evil is personified in the two doppelgängers.[2] The evil was not hard to find at all, yet neither was the good: it was the Tramp, of course, who, thanks to the advent of sound, is morphed into the Jewish barber.As such, The Great Dictator is a superb achievement. Its place in not only film history but world history actually works in its favor, accentuating the comedy with the tragic and the tragic with the comic. It's a work of precision, intelligence and, characteristic of Chaplin's genius, deep wisdom. Has there ever been a filmmaker who has understood us better than him? I think it's immensely useful to approach The Great Dictator as a dyadic exploration. On story level, there's the good versus evil contradistinction; technically there's the constant discourse between the silent and sound eras, which presents itself not only visually or in sounds, but also in how sound and what is seen become an integral element of the story, a kind of continuation of City Lights. Chaplin has such extensive fun on Hitler's expense in the public monologues that I wonder whether, in Michael Wood's words, ""he may in part be using speech to remind us of the beauties of silence.""[3] In the story there's some drastic and some very subtle use of undercranking, as befits 1910s, the silent era, the film starts with.[4] We're extremely lucky, by the way, to have the Criterion Collection putting these out on Blu-ray. Everything they've released so far from Chaplin has been immaculate.FOOTNOTES:[1] ""The Gold Rush"" (1925), for example, was inspired by the Donner party tragedy, as recounted by Chaplin in ""Mr. Chaplin Answers His Critics,"" from The New York Times, 27 October, 1940. On page 18 in the booklet for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray.[2] ""Just think,"" Chaplin would say, ""he's the madman, I'm the comic. But it could have been the other way around.""

g-96059,"Apr 22, 2020",8/10,"Premiered in 1940, it was a scathing satire on nazism and adolf Hitler. The climax comes at the end of the film, when he overtly calls for a political confrontation with fascism.
What makes the film special is that it was released at a time before the United States entered world war ii, when it was still on good terms with Nazi Germany. Before the panic over nazism had fully broken out, Chaplin's work was shocking and condemned Hitler, fascism, militarism and nazism. ""Robots have only mechanical minds and mechanical minds,"" he says at the end of the film. (Machine men, with Machine minds and Machine hearts.) The film was Chaplin's first sound film and one of his best box office hits."
farhadsabeti,"Sep 9, 2004",N/A,"I couldn't believe it. Chaplin made the movie in 1940. I hardly ever watch old movies, because, no matter how great they are, it just doesn't fit my current expectations. But, Great Dictator is an exception. I borrowed the two DVD's (one DVD had extra commentaries and color footage behind the scenes taken by Sydney Chaplin, Charley's brother). The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of humour and sophistication. Chaplin in later years said that if he knew the extent of Nazi's atrocities, he would not have made the movie. What a loss it would have been. The interesting thing was that, it was reported Hitler himself saw the movie, though it was banned in Germany at that time. One of the survivors of his inner circles said that Hitler would have definitely laughed hard if he indeed had seen it. What a pity, that he learned nothing from Chaplin's closing minutes in the movie!!!The way Chaplin portrayed the two characters (the Hynckler, or Hitler and the jew barber) was astonishing. While they were two different characters on the set, they were the same actor (Chaplin) and somehow they both related to Hitler. Hitler himself suspected he may have had Jewish blood (one of his close advisors later told him, after extensive research, that there was a 50-50 chance he might be one quarter Jewish), my gut feeling was that he was probably more Jewish that he thought or his advisors told him he was, just because he never liked to listen to what he didn't like to hear!!Then the barber's service in the firs world war (Hitler fought in WWI), and how Germany lost that war while he was hospitalized. And at the end, Chaplin presents a scenario in which the barber, as the new Reich, is leading the country away from death and destruction to peace. I think Chaplin had a feeling that Hitler probably had this other side within him that, if nurtured, would have taken him and the world to a different direction. It was not to be. There was also the opposite forces within Hitler (my personal opinion is that the source of this force was his ultra EGO which the DEVIL itself) that fought with the forces of peace and love. He chose the other way, and became nothing at the end. The movie, in my opinion, also portrays this fact very neatly, as the real Reich sitting in Jail, with his globe balloon burst. Chaplin not only portrayed the past and present in his movie, he some how foresaw the future. It is a great movie."
dimitrisalomao,"Mar 14, 2010",9/10,"I just don't understand how can people make such bad comedy movies today (some of them we don't even laugh), and one man could make a masterpiece with dumb jokes in 1940.Full of classic scenes and wonderful performances by Chaplin and Jack Oakie, this movies is mostly hilarious, but sometimes it shows the cruelty of the Nazis to the Jews, but without making it too emotional, and when you think the movie is turning to a drama, boom, there is another hilarious joke. But what is unique about this movie, is that Chaplin made jokes that are funny and, at the same time, criticizes without being too clear, so, at the same time that you laugh, you have to think what he was trying to say with that.But if you just go through the story, it will also be very pleasant to watch it, you will laugh in a way that you don't laugh in a long time unless before that you watch a Mel Brooks's movie. Some scenes in this movie are classic, like when Hynkel dances with the globe, or the first war sequence (Hilarious!).Verdict: A classic from a genius, incredibly funny, a must see for any movie lover (I can't imagine any person not liking this movie)."

dkncd,"Oct 13, 2007",10/10,"""The Great Dictator"" is Charlie Chaplin's film set in the fictional country of Tomania, which is analogous to Germany prior to and during the rise of the Nazi party. Chaplin successfully blended humor with anti-fascist social commentary to produce a great film.Chaplin himself has a double role in the film. First, he is Adenoid Hynkel, who represents Adolf Hitler. Chaplin manages to make his representation of the nefarious dictator highly amusing. He also plays another role as a Jewish barber subjected to the repressive policies of Hynkel. The other performances in the film were excellent as well, and Jack Oakie deserves particular note as the showy and blunt Benzini Napaloni, representing Benito Mussolini.The film starts by showing Tomania in World War I, and there are some amusing scenes here before the end of the war and the rise of Hynkel. Hynkel is shown in a scene that mocks the platform speeches of Hitler. Admittedly I didn't find the speech shouted in mock German particularly amusing, although it was amusing how the Goebbels and Goering equivalents were named ""Garbitsch"" and ""Herring"".After the platform speech, this film gains a lot of momentum. There is a variety of humor, including funny physical comedy scenes like the ""globe"" scene and the portrayal of Hynkel's routine. There was a lot of great comedic dialogue too, some of which is darkly humorous given the full historical context. When this film isn't funny, it remains interesting with its anti-fascist message through depictions of repressions of Jewish people by Storm Troopers. The film's score is appropriate in both the comedic and political scenes. Chaplin's final plea against fascism at the film's end remains deeply moving and has lost none of its potency. The Great Dictator"" remains strong as a comedy film and a political message."
IkuharaKunihiko,"Dec 12, 2005",9/10,"During World War I the Tramp fought for his country Tomania. Unfortunately, since the dictator Hynkel took the charge over Tomania, the Tramp has become in grave danger since he is a Jew. One of his friends is the charming Hannah...Although many critics claim that Chaplin's best film is one from his silent era, like ""City Lights"" and ""The Gold Rush"", I'm going to boldly claim that his first sound picture ""The Great Dictator"" deserves that honor. Chaplin was nominated for 3 Oscars for this ( best film, screenplay, actor ) and it's a pity that he didn't win at least one. Because ""The Dictator"" is far superior to some other Oscar winning World War II films, like Bengini's silly ""Life is beautiful"". The whole story is extremely stylish, Chaplin's gags are mendaciously graded and executed and almost every gesture or movement is orchestrated like a good ballet. Just take the scene where the tramp is on the battle front and gets an order to throw a hand grenade. He wants to throw the grenade, but it falls down his sleeve. The way the tramp gets in panic and quickly removes his clothes is something so hypnotically funny you just have to see it to believe it.----------Unlike his previous films, which were excellent but a little childish and outdated, ""The Dictator"" is dark, serious, cynical, touching and mature. Some gags are satirical ( German's minister of propaganda Goebbels is here called something like Garbage ) while some are just plain full of style ( the storm troopers want to hang the tramp on a light bolt but when their commender shows up they salute him and drop the tramp ). Also, the fact that the dictator Hynkel looks exactly like the Jewish barber gives the story a more profound message, the one how maybe he is hating and prosecuting himself and how even the most evil people have their good sides. The open ending underlies that, since the tramp and the dictator change their places. This truly deserves to be in the top 100 best films. A shining achievement.Grade: 9/10"
nukisepp,"Jan 4, 2021",9/10,"Charles Chaplin's first sound movie might seem not very subtle work of the great auteur. At the first glance 'The Great Dictator' is a straight-up mockery of Adolf Hitler (even the character's name is not very subtle - Adenoid Hynkel), and the movie became prophetic as at the time of its production the whole extent of the terrors by Nazi regime wasn't known to the wider public. Chaplin himself later revealed that, had he known about the full extent of the horrors, he would have never made this film.'The Great Dictator' is a brilliant mixture of satire, melodrama, slapstick, and lighthearted espionage comedy. The usual Chaplin style comedy is toned down (of course there are a couple of Chaplinesque stunts like the barber diving headfirst into the bin) and the dramatic bits seem like this film could have worked as realistic drama. Satire is deep, sharp, and subtle but in the next moment, it grows blatant mockery of Adolf Hitler (which is brilliant itself). Chaplin even entered into the 'method acting' territory by learning Hitler's speech and facial expressions. The other actors seemed to take their roles in a serious manner without trying to be comical. The exception is of course the fantastic Jack Oakie as pompous dictator of Bacteria, Napaloni. These quiet performances enhanced the comical behavior of a Jewish Barber and of course, over the top insanity of Hynkel. To totally different roles - what a way to make a talkie debut.That legendary end speech. It is said that this was Chaplin's real speech. Well, it could be, but did you notice how his speech progressed to look very similar to Hynkel's (Hitler's) vigorous spouts of hate. Although Chaplin wanted to give us comforting words that the world needs more mutual respect and care but did he wanted to say something else? Like, when someone talks about love with such rage in their voice, they are equally dangerous as those who speak hate? I don't know. I guess we all can make our own assumptions. Interpretation - that is one of the great perks of good art.One thing is sure - if you don't like 'The Great Dictator' then you are an Adenoid."
the_jedi_jones,"Aug 23, 2015",10/10,"Funny yet important and 75 years on is still highly topical. This film should be used in schools to educate new generations about the values that a modern and free society protects. Through this parody, a great deal is taught about what not to tolerate as a society, whereby we can discover what values we should strive uphold. Highly inspiring and thought provoking this film will be watched for hundreds of years to come and beyond.The time the film was released also reveals further meaning. It shines an honest light on the Nazi (double cross) atrocities and mocks then in comedic fashion, while tastefully poking fun at the sometimes thuggish foot soldiers, all in good humour and yet wraps it all up in a spiritual message of unity in the closing speech. The whole show is done in such a way as to raise moral of the allies and was not only educational, enlightening and hilarious, but also served to remind everyone what we all really want is peace.10 out of 10 stars."
Spleen,"Aug 7, 1999",9/10,"Charlie Chaplin and Adolf Hitler, for reasons best known to themselves, DID elect to wear the same paintbrush moustache, and it was only a matter of time before someone made use of this coincidence somehow.  Luckily it was Chaplin himself.Oddly enough, Chaplin plays a Jew who happens to have the same moustache as the Great Dictator, and it's only a matter of time before someone makes use of this coincidence somehow ...The story gets put on hold every so often with comic set pieces that make it clear why Chaplin was so highly regarded.  The penny-swallowing scene and the bit set to Brahms's fourth Hungarian Dance are hilarious and more than hilarious - agile and beautiful as well.  (On the other hand, the globe scene, which I'm surprised to see people rave about, goes on forever.)  Yet the story - or at any rate the basic situation - is still interesting enough to hold things together.  The central character is the most reluctant of reluctant heroes.  In a word, he's a coward.  He HAS no hidden reserves of courage to draw upon when he needs them.  But somehow he rises to the occasion anyway.As a satire of Nazi Germany it's inevitably lacking, constrained in a hundred ways by the political conditions of, and lack of hindsight available in, the year in which it was made.  The speech at the end is all very well but the content doesn't seem quite right today.  (It would be more fittingly directed against Stalin than Hitler.)  A partial misfire - but triumphantly great in places."
gmzewski,"Feb 9, 2006",9/10,"I've never before seen this film in its entirety, simply because Chaplin's style has never really been much to my liking. The film as a whole is rather drawn-out and slow, his comedic impersonation of Hitler gets old after a while. But I watched it fully the other night, and realized what a powerful story it tells, and OMIGOD!! his speech in those couple of final scenes are to me, the some of the most powerful & beautiful social/political commentary I've even seen or heard. Not only for the context of its time (1940) but for ALL time, ALL the world to see and hear! I never knew Chaplin's personal convictions ran so deep. After watching this one, I now have an entirely new & different view of him, quite apart from his comic character, as a citizen of the world who cared strongly enough to put his words on film! EXCELLENT!!"
rrfpaf-99858,"Feb 6, 2021",8/10,"Some of Hollywood's most unique works are the World War II propaganda films. During a time when America refused to participate, two films Woodspur on the hearts and minds of America to exit solitude and face the darkness of the world. Sergeant York shared the true story of A pacifist who discovered some things are worth fighting for, and the Great Dictator reminds us that evil men will fall. Whether by our hands or by the hands of death, evil men themselves are temporary. Minor globalist comments aside, this is one of the most important culture pieces in film history."
kenjha,"Jan 7, 2010",8/10,"The eerie resemblance between Chaplin's Little Tramp character and Hitler is used to good advantage in this satire. Chaplin waited until this 1940 film to make his first talkie and much of his dialog is gibberish! However, comedy is the universal language and there is much here that is quite amusing. One of the iconic scenes has Chaplin playing with a gas-filled globe, as he contemplates world domination. The scene goes on a bit too long, however, as does the film in general before concluding with an unnecessarily preachy speech. Despite some heavy-handedness, Chaplin is to be applauded for bringing attention to Hitler's atrocities before they became widely known."
miaalike,"Jan 6, 2026",4/10,"Didn't actually see it for a long time, whilst hearing quotes and seeing just bits of it. I thought it is better. But seen all through, it lags, it weakens, it is too mellow and simplistic... The speech for freedom should have been strong, yet it is unneccessarily poetic and all over the place. ""Soldiers, do not fight for the war, fight for freedom""? I imagine at one point or another soldiers believe they fight for a good cause, for freedom, yet in the big picture, it is still war and fighting and crime. No real alternative stands out in this movie. Yet it should have presented one, instead of going all poetic and artsy. So, surprisingly, not at all a good movie, more of a political statement of the moment, happening to fall onto a plea for humanity. Yet pleas are not enough in face of atrocities, and the industrialization (see men as machines, as presented in this movie), is almost overdue in our times, and it did see to its way, beyond 1940s. To keep humanity intact, while upgrading it, a different type of thinking and feeling needs to speak up..."
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 26, 2015",N/A,"it could be a manifesto, expression of courage, powerful form of protest. but, after decades, it remains testimony about the essence of life. small crumbs and force of state. love and need of power. and a speech who is in every period fresh. and necessary. it is not exactly a political criticism but good example for its public for discover and define the reality of every day. for remind the basic values of society, for rediscover the profound sense of democracy. a film who has the same ingredients like many of Chaplin's films. but, in same measure, it remains unique. for the science to translate the tension, hate and fear of a period in challenge for each of its viewers."
caspian1978,"Oct 17, 2001",9/10,"Chaplin's funny, yet political film, in one of the most dangerous times in American to be both funny and political. The ending alone is more powerful than any image throughout the film. Chaplin makes clear to the audience that the common man's view is more innocent and poetic than any speech a dictator could make. While people want to remember Chaplin for such films like Gold Rush and Modern Times, the Great Dictator has to be is biggest and best films with a moral and decent message for its viewers."
redryan64,"Sep 22, 2007",10/10,"As far as really good examples of Pro-American, Pro-Allied Forces, Anti-Nazi Germany World War II films to come out of Hollywood are two. One is the Walt Disney Donald Duck short subject,DER FUEHRER'S FACE(1942). The other is discussed in the following.It has been said that The One and only Constant is Change. We're not sure who said it; though we did know, it changed on us! This World wide Change or ""State of Flux"", if you will, was very evident in the period between the two World Wars, and in every aspect of life. Political unrest, Pop Cultural Shock, Shifting Mores and a Post 'War to End All Wars' Era all combined to give us a World barely recognizable to the Populice of 30 years or so before.And just think! First it was ""How You Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm, Now that They've Seen Par-ee!"", and then they went and stuck us with National Prohibition! That's another thing, The Volsted Act, Mother of Temperence, or Organized Crime?But in any case, we had a great wave of change had overtaken Hollywood, hitting it from every direction. Undoubtedly the greatest shock-wave here came from the Sound Revolution. The Motion Picture had spent the previously 30+ Years in being forged, honed and fine tuned. The result was a Beautiful New Art Form; being a perfect Marriage of Visual Imagery with the Printed Word(Title Cards), with some emotional support of Musical Accompaniment.Now along comes people like Inventor Lee DeForrest and Company. With them they brought processes like ""Vitaphnoe"", ""Western Electric Recording System"", ""RCA High Fidelity"" and even ""Photophone Recording Process"". Almost over night, the Studios and Movie Going Public became just about totally obsessed with SOUND, DIALOGUE, ALL-TALKING & ALL-SINGING! Charlie Chaplin was in as good a position as any to meet the challenges of the 'New Era'. His position, wealth and influence had rapidly and steadily grown from the time of his signing his first one year deal with Mack Sennett and his Keystone Studios. The popularity of his 1 and 2 Reeler Comedies brought him successively better financial growth and artistic autonomy over his films. Progressivly improving contracts with Keystone, Essanay, Mutual and First National, led to his owning and operating his own ""Chaplin Studios"" and his co-founding the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation.* So Mr. Chaplin had successfully been able to forestall the intrusion of Sound and ""the Talkies"" into his film world. Both CITY LIGHTS(1931) and MODERN TIMES(1936)had sound tracks, but it was mostly filled up with Musical Scores(written by??**)and some sound effects. But the 1930's were rapidly coming to an end, and August 31st with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany from the West, followed by The Red Army of Soviet Russia's pouring in from the East.Chaplin wanted to make his next film something truly special, unique and truly a ""One of a Kind"" for the Depression Ridden '30's. It would surely appear that 'The Little Tramp' succeeded.In THE GREAT DICTATOR, we are shown a metamorphosis on the screen, right before our very eyes. It was done subtly, without the obvious being said, shown or even implied.In the earliest scenes we are brought up to 'the Front' in World War I. It is a fictionalized version , though only lightly so. The 'Enemy' Army is identified as being the Army of ""Tomainia"", but the soldiers, Officers and Enlisted Men, all have a decidedly German look to their Wartime Fashion. A certain allusion is made to ""Big Bertha's"" being used by the 'Enemy'.*** At this point we are introduced to 'A Jewish Barber'(Charlie Chaplin) who is on an artillery crew turned into Infantryman. The scenes involving the battle, heavy smoke and an encounter with Allied Forces(could have been either Brits or Yanks, uniforms similar).But as this segment winds down, we are essentially saying good-bye to the ""Little Tramp"" and his beautiful, mime filled world of silence/silents.From then on, Wrtier/Director Chaplin uses A Case of Mistaken Identity(The Jewish Barber & Dictator Adnoid Hynkel both=Chaplin); by God, it's the old ""Evil Twin"" plot! To this we see real-life like incidents, such as the Big Meeting of Dictators, Adenoid Hynkel & Benzino Napolini(Jack Oakie in his hilarious Parody of Benito Mussolini)and the annexation of 'Austalich'(the Austrian 'anshlucz'or union).In addition to the already mentioned Mr. Jack Oakie, we have Paulette Goddard, then Mrs. Chaplin in the Female Lead(Hannah). Also featuring Henry Daniel, Reginald Gardiner, Billy Gilbert(Herring=Herman Goering spoof), Bernard Gorcy(Leo's real life Dad), Maurice Moscavitch, Richard Alexander, Hank Mann, Leo White, Stanley ""Tiny"" Sandford,Chester Conklin, Cyril Ring, Hans Schumm and many others.Perhaps a little long for some maybe, but there is no wasted film here. Sir Charles took every opportunity to paint his Hitler parody as a buffoon, a maniac and a dangerous fool.And Chaplin, speaking as himself, wraps it all up most seriously and imparting a wish of Hope to a Crazy World.NOTE: * THE UNITED ARTISTS Corporation, founded in 1919 by Douglas Fairbanks,Mary Pickford,Charles Chaplin and D.W. Griffith.NOTE: ** With no formal training and not being able to read music, Chaplin did compose his own scores and even hit songs, ""Smile""(from MODERN TIMES)and ""Love This Is My Song!""(from A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG,1967 his last film).NOTE:*** 'BIG BERTHA'(in German 'Dicke Bertha',nickname the Germans had for their Model L/14 Heavy Mortar-like Howitzer."

directjw,"Apr 12, 2007",10/10,"Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on an edge. Also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the film first."
CubsandCulture,"Jan 31, 2022",10/10,"This is both a great Chaplin comedy and a forceful antifascist work. It has many great sequences of visual comedy, i.e. The globe. It has many injokes about Chaplin working in sound fully for the first time, i.e. The translations of the fake German. It has great pathos as manifested in the Jewish Barber's story and tellingly the perfect final speech is a ethos to live by.I watched this for the first time in about 1996. I recently re-watched it in early 2022. The point of laughing at fascists-Hitler, Mussolini, etc.-hits all the harder today than it has in years because of the resurgent far right in the US. Someone should make a similar film about Trump."

alluyb1tch,"May 24, 2021",8/10,"Chaplin's tragicomic film that became a classic for parodying the Nazi leader: Hitler, during the Second World War. It has a direct and explicit message of criticism and denunciation, it makes me brave whoever has taken this type of material in the middle of a war context where nothing was certain. It made me a bit long and at times capable a bit monotonous but the humor and how it handles the plot giving it sour and sweet flavors at the same time, keeps you following the thread.Chaplin and his final speech is what crowns not only the theme of the film itself, but also himself as an actor, the way he increases his voice, and his gestures until he is completely carried away by that euphoria really projects not only a political speech but a politician himself. Paulette Goddard is enthusiastic, a character who in her weakness shows a lot of strength, the end made it her own.I am surprised that this film did not sweep the Oscars because of the courage and conviction of the creator. Nominated for 5 Oscars, among them ""Best Picture"", ""Best Actor"" for Chaplin and ""Best Supporting Actor"" for Jack Oakie, which I accompanied acceptably."
saadanathan,"Aug 15, 2021",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin is the mastermind behind this marvelous work. In fact, when you look back he is the mastermind behind all of his movies: being leading actor, director, screenwriter and even composer.""The Great Dictator"" is a hilarious but deep meaningful story that resembles (and even foreshadows) the rise of Adolf Hitler and the start of WW2.The movie intentionally makes fun of Hitler without actually referring to him. And draws a lot of inspiration from the Nazi party and the start of the war. In the same way the movie talks about the discrimination of the Jewish people in the state leading to what would be known as The Holocaust.What mostly got me attached to this film was the incredible humor of Chaplin and the resemblance to the actual turn of events. Although near the end of the movie we are given a call for peace instead of war.A true shame the actual turn of events that happened but we are at least given we a special and lovely ending. Besides this movie would have been known less if it weren't for the comedy and slapstick of Chaplin.A beautiful comedy indeed."

Not a Chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing."
zzhhhqing,"Apr 28, 2020",9/10,"As Chaplin's first audio film, its influence has gone beyond a film.

Jeremy_Urquhart,"Sep 28, 2021",8/10,"Chaplin gets points for trying to calm the world down during the early stages of WW2, but ultimately it's a shame that history proved him unsuccessful. That ending can come off as overly idealistic as a result, but it is still an effectively written and amazingly acted sequence.As for the rest of the movie, it's mostly really good. There's some great comedy (the funniest scenes are the ones that feel like they are from a silent comedy, like the WW1 opening, the globe scene, the shaving scene, and the scene with the coins in the pudding), and the comedic moments are fairly well balanced amongst the more serious moments (and it does contain much more drama than Chaplin's other features from the 20s and 30s).It might be a little long, with some sequences in the film's second half dragging. Also, I feel like more could've been done with the premise of a Jewish barber being mistaken for a fascist dictator, as it really only happens towards the end of the movie to allow that final scene to happen. But given that that ending is very memorable, it's largely forgivable."

However, Chaplin still refused to change his mind and risked being assassinated to openly challenge the Nazis.This is a movie where you want to stand up and clap for Chaplin!""In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone."""
arthur_tafero,"Apr 4, 2022",8/10,"Not only is this some of the funniest comedy you will ever see on film, it is also a powerful commentary on Nazism and Adolph Hitler and their heinous realities. Charlie Chaplin is perfect as Adolph. His character's name, Hynkel, is a thinly-veiled reference to Hitler. Fun for the whole family. Though a bit overlong and a little preachy, the film still delivers lots of laughs."
Darth_Osmosis,"May 25, 2018",10/10,"Absolutely hilarious satire on the Nazi party and Hitler. Too many memorable scenes ranging from simple slapstick to more subtle pokes at the fuhrer! And Charlie Chaplin the most iconic star of the silent era, delivers one of, if not the greatest speech in movie history.. It's truly amazing!"
v-56289,"Mar 9, 2020",9/10,"I did not really know what to expect.. I have known the final speech for a while and so I decided to see the entire movie. At first I thought it will be this dumb silent movie grotesque what I normally don't enjoy... But surprisingly, the Great Dictator is a very hilarious political satire with interesting plot and funny resemblances... especially when one considers the year when the movie was made, it definitely shall not be forgotten. I was about to give full 10 stars but because still I am not a fan of these kind of movies and especially at the beginning it took me a while to get caught my attention"
st-shot,"Dec 10, 2010",9/10,"With war raging in Europe and only a matter of time before America's entrance Charlie Chaplin took it upon himself to go where other moguls feared to tread with this courageous satirical broadside. The Great Dictator does not mince words with its comic evisceration of Adolf Hitler and his Fascist cronies. It is a savage mock-up in which only Chaplin alone could make a comic moment out of the fascist lynching of a Jew without devaluing the impact of the film's firm indictment and condemnation.The film opens on a World War l battlefield with Charlie evoking his 1918 Shoulder Arms silent character manning Big Bertha. He suffers battle fatigue and is sent to a sanitarium to recuperate. Meanwhile Dictator Adenoid Hynkel capitalizes on his country's economic woes by scapegoating the Jews (and after them the brunettes). The vet unable to comprehend the passing of time returns to civilian life and his job as a Jewish Barber, unaware of his country's moral deconstruction. Hynkel continues to lust for world power while the Barber is brought up to speed by cruel storm troopers when fate intervenes.This timely and absurdist black comedy on the eve of WW ll might be the finest piece of Hollywood political activism in Tinsel Town history. Chaplin could have easily stayed out of the argument but chose instead to wade in not with some prepared statement or sit down protest but with the full weight of his prodigious talent resulting in a motion picture that sits between Duck Soup and Dr. Strangelove in displaying the brilliance of satiric Voltarian discourse by way of Mack Sennett.Chaplin's script and Hynkel's portrayal along with fellow cronies is devastatingly funny and demeaning reducing them to comic buffoons; removing their Conrad Veidt to vanquish them from another angle. Hynkel is a vainglorious Moe and Chaplin cuts him to the quick with a comic jabber and an unsettling but balletic display of lust for power. Henry Daniel as Garbige is chillingly serious and persuasive in mock contrast to funny but a bit over the top Billy Gilbert's Herring and Jack Oakie's Napaloni, though Mussolini newsreels from the era reveal not by much.Chaplin does get overly preachy during the climax and it deflects from the no holds barred style of the humor and pace somewhat but overall it is a brave and audacious piece of film making in which someone can so powerfully assimilate pain and laughter without diluting the impact of either."
Mnemosyne15,"Mar 20, 2020",9/10,"Chaplin is not only a master with super high comedy talent, but also a master who has made outstanding contributions in the film art industry. He should be the earliest self-directed filmmaker. He has a unique body language that combines dance and acrobatics. His outstanding film can be perfectly reflected in the silent film field, leaving precious wealth and classic moments for the film and the audience. When the Great Dictator was released, it was Hitler's most arrogant moment. Chaplin was able to stand up and laugh at him at this moment, but imagined how much courage was needed. Let us pay tribute to this master!"
