AlsExGal,"May 24, 2023",8/10,"... in which Chaplin tried to modernize The Gold Rush by taking out the title cards, adding narration which he himself did, changing the music, and deleting some scenes. It isn't bad since Chaplin himself redid it, but I just prefer the original.It isn't as funny as The Kid, not as heartbreaking as City Lights, and it doesn't have the social commentary of Modern Times. Instead it has a little bit of everything plus lots of atmosphere AND it takes Chaplin's Little Tramp out of some anonymous urban environment and lands him in a very specific place and time - the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s. I could feel the biting cold, the hunger, the loneliness. And in spite of this being set in the 1890s and seeming quite authentic to its setting, this film has a very modern feel to it, almost timeless.Chaplin's ""little fellow"" is introduced as a lone prospector. We never see him doing any prospecting, but it is later mentioned that he is not very successful at it and gives it up. The first part of the film has the little fellow waiting out a blizzard in a cabin with a wanted criminal in addition to a fellow prospector. The second part has Chaplin's character traveling to a Klondike boom town, watching a cabin for a more successful prospector, and falling in love with a dance hall girl who thinks his crush is just a big joke, at least at first.I don't think it was Chaplin's best silent film, but it does manage to do all aspects of the production very well and I can see why some people would judge it as his best. And if that was Chaplin in that chicken suit, all I can say is that he had the motions of a chicken down pat. To know what I'm talking about, watch and find out."
lukelandry1,"Apr 16, 2014",7/10,"I'm just an 18 year old dude in high school that was assigned this movie in a class at my school. When I first saw the genres of this movie I was not looking forward to it at all. It was the first silent movie I was seeing and also the oldest. It had originally seemed like everything I didn't look for in a ""good"" movie. At the conclusion of this movie I knew that my original thought process was entirely wrong. This movie has certainly changed my view on both silent and older films, especially on a comedic standpoint. There was so much about it that was appealing to the viewer. I recommend this movie to all looking to expand their film genres of interest."
didi-5,"Mar 30, 2005",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin's silent film (also re-released with a narration in the early 1940s) focuses, as usual, on the Little Tramp, and in this case, his attraction to a chorus girl (Georgia Hale). This is the one where he eats a boot, along with its laces, and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rolls.The role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin, Lita Grey, but her pregnancy ruled her out. Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions. Mack Swain appears as Big Jim, who shares a cabin with the Tramp, at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and gold-runners, as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero. As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time, as a sound film, it is fairly good."
planktonrules,"Apr 28, 2006",10/10,"I've seen both version of this film--the original silent version from 1925 and the re-release by Chaplin in the 1940s. The difference is that the re-release was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies. To do this, title cards were removed--having Chaplin narrate the film. In addition, Chaplin-created music (for the most part--some were classical pieces), sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer. I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVD--it has both plus excellent DVD extras. Otherwise, there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out there--many with terrible quality prints or music or both. The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find. The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the 1942 re-release.I use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film, though I might, in the future, use it for my Psychology classes as well (I teach both) because Chaplin's genius came from his obsessive-compulsive nature. The movie reportedly had 27 times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than 60 takes!!The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century. Along the way, he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb. Suffice to say, the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch (something not true of all full-length slapstick comedies--sometimes, their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to full-length).This is a gorgeous, well-executed piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac. The musical score (arranged by Chaplin), direction, acting and cinematography all are simply perfect--making this, in my opinion, the best full-length silent comedy ever made. This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton's films!"
Anonymous_Maxine,"May 15, 2001",10/10,"The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.Charlie and Big Jim are left alone and without food when Larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene), and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. There is, of course, the boot eating scene, memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness, but also because while making the film, Chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Another thing that was really well done was the special effects. I am still amazed every time I watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing Charlie hanging from the door of the cabin, which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. Also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene, the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film Shine, with Geoffrey Rush.There is also a very noteworthy love element of The Gold Rush, a part of the story that Chaplin generally has much success with in his films. Charlie's amorous interests in Georgia, a dance hall girl, leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls, probably the most famous scene in the film, which was also performed very well by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon. Charlie's relationship with Georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes, when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. Chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies, and The Gold Rush is one of the best of his full length features. A must see for any Chaplin fan, but The Gold Rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch."
Snow Leopard,"Aug 6, 2001",N/A,"This silent classic has many strong points - it has a lot of humor, interesting characters, a good story and good settings.  It's the kind of film that shows how much a master film-maker can communicate in a silent movie.  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion, but other than that it's a fine film.Chaplin himself plays the 'Lone Prospector', and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama.  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors' rickety cabins, plus some other good material.The version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin re-edited in the 1940's, adding his own narration and deleting the title cards, which gives it a slightly different feel.  (These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who aren't used to silent films.) You can tell from Chaplin's narration how fond he must have been of ""The Gold Rush"", and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it.  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless, but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art."
lee_eisenberg,"May 13, 2005",10/10,"The 1898 Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh, but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious. As an unnamed prospector, Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon. Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner, the dancing roles, and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff. His companion, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplin's character to be a chicken, and before long, a bear enters their cabin. In the midst of it all, the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia (Georgia Hale).A real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!"
PhilipJames1980,"Jun 7, 2004",10/10,"The Gold Rush is pure gold.  It was Charlie Chaplin's third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.This movie should be counted among Chaplin's best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I've also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy's immortal geniuses.Having first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college's silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen.Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven't even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that's also on the disc.The viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard.  On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!Also, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD.  But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.The first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies.And the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they've seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.I don't say this to sound pretentious.  I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted.  It's hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years.For example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin's first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama.  In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema's potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously.  Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.The joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy.  This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle's aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp's grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.One pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing.When Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm.  This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD.The second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn't sustain the entire film at the cabin.  Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film's third act.I don't want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.Mack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat.  Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid.  From what I've seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show.The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today's more sophisticated stories and special effects.  The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia's true feelings for the Tramp.But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.  What a shame.Rating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)"
ACitizenCalledKane,"Jan 4, 2005",10/10,"To see Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment. One cannot help but enjoy a film as well-done as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered, and I can see why. It is a masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like all great movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was a master of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a brisk pace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold. Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich. But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Of course, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the ego-maniacal ""lady killer."" All of this would be too much for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie, I am a fan of Charlie Chaplin's movies, but as objective as I can possibly be, this IS one of the great movies...Essential viewing!"
Xstal,"Sep 10, 2020",9/10,"Then came the dawn, and with it one of the standout scenes in any silent movie as the cabin teeters on the brink. There are so many elements in this film, elements that would be reused and recombined in various presentations over the years and on so many occasions - the gold standard.Endearing and adorable Charlie Chaplin - a genuinely pioneering prospector."
Jared G.,"Sep 8, 1999",7/10,"First of all, I fall into the Buster Keaton camp when it comes to silent comedy.  I'll take Keaton's stone face over Chaplin's sentimentality anyday. But this still is a very good film that anyone interested in film history ought to see. The boot eating scene and the potato dance are classic scenes."
faithnomore41291,"Sep 9, 2010",3/10,"This is the first silent film I have ever seen, so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound (other than the piano in the background) in a 90 minute movie. So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas across.I felt like they did some of same gags over and over again, like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove. It just got really old to me quickly. I don't know maybe because I'm from a different time period and way life but the film just didn't do anything for me. I didn't really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only 30 to 40 minutes long and nothing would have been lost."
tfrizzell,"Nov 7, 2003",N/A,"Charles Chaplin's ""The Gold Rush"" is arguably his finest film. He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich. What he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form of Georgia Hale) instead of money. In the end that may be all right with him. ""The Gold Rush"" shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer, writer and director he was. Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the 20th Century, Chaplin showed humanity, love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. The movie is exceptional in every way. Although I am not as well-versed with movies from the 1920s as I am with the decades following it, I would still probably call ""The Gold Rush"" the finest film of that 10-year period. Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today. 5 stars out of 5."
ga_cum197,"Feb 20, 2021",10/10,"Why something simple like this movie can make us feel so much?! I mean nowadays, movies are oversaturated with big budgets, visual effects, advertising campaigns but more than 50% of them can really deliver.
Charlie Chaplin's films are indeed true cinema. Given it was made in 1925, it's perfect to me. I have nothing to criticize or analyze it. Sometimes, we just forget what a film is supposed to be. It's supposed to make us feel, to make us acknowledge that it's a film, and to age well
There are some so called movies that I never consider them movies: Transformers 2,3,4,5. Twilight 2,3,4. Justice League....and so on.
Those just make me appreciate the classics even more."
Andreas-S,"Jan 29, 2004",10/10,"One of the best Chaplin movies, which means one of the best movies ever made. Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe' and `The Roll Dance'. Both the original version and the second release have their own charm."
ctrout,"Sep 27, 2005",10/10,"All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene that's very memorable because it's either very funny or very touching. In this film, it's one of the funny ones.You see, in this film, Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush. Along the way, he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them. Since they must try to survive in the cold weather, Chaplin decides to cook dinner. What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so great.It's not just that one joke though, there are tons of laughs in this great movie. So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies. You'll have a lot of fun watching it.As of now, this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that I've seen, but it probably won't be for long. I think he's one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon."
ffinixs,"Jun 15, 2005",10/10,"What a delightful film. I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches. Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic. I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff. This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them, like the eating shoe scene, fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun, and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene. When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments. I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Year's Eve knowing that he was stood-up. I genuinely felt for him. Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time. Brilliant."
lugonian,"Jan 26, 2002",10/10,"THE GOLD RUSH (United Artists, 1925), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin, may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era, but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations. So proud of his achievement, Chaplin reissued this silent film in 1942 with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself, eliminating the use of title cards. Then in the summer of 1971, THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting station's 13-week series of ""The Silent Years,"" as hosted by Orson Welles, from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William Perry.THE GOLD RUSH, which is set in the turn of the century, opens with The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) coming to Alaska. A snow storm drives him into the cabin of ""Black"" Lawson (Tom Murray), an outlaw. ""Big Jim"" McKay (Mack Swain), another prospector who has found gold on his claim, is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin. After much struggle, Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests. Stranded due to the heavy storm, Larson, finds himself chosen to go out for help. While out in the storm, he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him. He gets away by stealing their dog sled, but is later killed in an avalanche. Back to the cabin, Charlie and Larson, almost in near starvation, eventually make a meal out of a large bear. When the snow storm finally subsides, the two men go about their separate ways. Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia (Georgia Hale), a dance hall girl, causing jealousy from her suitor, Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite). As for Jim, he has forgotten where his gold claim is, and locates Charlie to help him find it, separating him from Georgia. The results that follow is classic Chaplin.Aside from a large list of supporting players, which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis, ""The Gold Rush"" contains many now classic comedy supplements, including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water, and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlie's encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim, in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement. There are tender moments, too, including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Year's Eve dinner, with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming. The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for them.With THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplin's most revived and discussed movie, one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed, including THE CIRCUS (1928), CITY LIGHTS (1931), MODERN TIMES (1936) and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940). Since the advent of home video in the early 1980s, THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores, ranging from the use of piano, organ or orchestra. There are even some editions that have no music track at all, along with some copies running different time lengths, and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout. The 1942 reissue, being a shorter print with Chaplin's narration, not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics, but can also be found on Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a 1921 comedy short, PAY DAY. Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection. But in spite of numerous editions, THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics (1997-2001) and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter 1942 reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score. While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector, avid lip readers will notice that he is called ""Charlie"" by his supporting players, especially by Georgia. (****)"
SMK-4,"Dec 16, 1998",7/10,"Chaplin was a great director in his time but many of his films have aged badly, simply because his sentimentality has completely gone out of fashion which puts a modern audience in a rather uneasy relationship to the Tramp character.  This problem also applies to this film which for a long time was regarded as one of the very best ever made.   It probably is no more.Despite of this, The Gold Rush is still very much enjoyable for its most famous moments, like Chaplin devouring a shoe (which was made out of licorice, I believe) or the potato-fork-dance."
llltdesq,"Nov 23, 2001",10/10,"If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability, t you a commend this film, as well as City Lights.  Modern Times isn't, strictly speaking, a silent film, although Chaplin had no dialogue there.  The Gold Rush, while not Chaplin's best film, does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits, it must be seen.  Excellent film.  1942 version redone by Chaplin is a bit better, but either will do.  Most highly recommended."
uhu,"Apr 17, 2002",3/10,"I cannot follow the praise of that movie by other viewers. Unlike his later works (such as The Circus, Modern Times, Citylights) the plot is thin and not well writen. The directing has many flaws, the scenes often ending abruptly with no clear link to the following. I love Chaplin films, but this one was disappointing."
Petey-10,"Aug 25, 2004",N/A,"Charlie Chaplin is the Lone Prospector who goes to Klondike, Alaska in search of gold.There he meets and falls in love to beautiful Georgia (Georgia Hale).In cold and snowy Alaska he rambles forward looking for gold with his fellow prospector Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) thinking of her.A genius called Charlie Chaplin made in 1925 this silent movie masterpiece known as The Gold Rush.Now nearly 80 years after the film was made we get to watch this genius in a tramp suit doing his job.And he did it well.Better than probably anybody.He could make us laugh and he could make us cry.Maybe even both of those at the same time.Chaplin realized that every good comedy has a little tragedy. Of course I have to give credits to other actors as well.Mack Swain as Big Jim McKay is not only a big man, he's also big at his acting skills. Georgia Hale is as beautiful of woman as she is a great actress. The Gold Rush is filled with marvelous scenes.The most memorable is the shoe-eating scene.Chaplin on the dance floor is also something to remember.Through the movie you can hear the score Chaplin composed to this movie.It works perfectly.Just like the whole movie.It's pure gold from the beginning till the end."
GTDMAC,"Mar 11, 2003",10/10,"The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator.  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux.  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy. As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting.  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen.  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramp's world City Lights falls short.  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what ""Charlot"" has been all about all along. It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplin's works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime. 10 out of 10."

jxj-55996,"Sep 28, 2017",10/10,"The Gold Rush is a Charlie Chaplin classic. Released in 1925, The Gold Rush was Chaplin's 3rd film, and contains many standards of his work. The film features the famous Chaplin character, referred to as the ""Tramp"", or the ""little fellow"". The version I watched was the 1942 re-release, which featured a new score, as well as narration from Chaplin himself.Charlie Chaplin is famous for being an influence on many films after his time, which I did not truly appreciate until I saw this movie. The Gold Rush showcases many of these influential elements. A number of iconic Chaplin scenes, such as the dance of the dinner rolls, the windy cabin, and the boiled shoe dinner are from this movie. This was the first Chaplin film I had seen, and afterwards, I began to notice many scenes in modern movies such as La La Land and Baby Driver incorporated elements of Chaplin's brand of visual humor.This style of visual humor is subtle, effective and almost elusive. It involves staging, progression and cinematography. By understanding that Charlie Chaplin began his career in theater, his approaches start to make a little more sense. Many Chaplin scenes are staged like theater productions. That is to say, the camera has a wide view of an entire room, and does not move during a long, continuous scene. It mimics the experience of the audience watching a theater production. Chaplin also builds humor using a sense of progression, slowly building the ridiculousness of his scenes, each gag sillier than the last.Despite it's age, The Gold Rush still exhibits a highly advanced understanding of narrative and visual story telling. Chaplin was not a fan of having many title cards in his films, so he tried to minimize the necessity of them by having the character's actions speak for themselves. I wish I could have watched the original silent version of the film first, so that I could better compare the two and how well they got the story across. The narrated version offers a great amount of depth, without being overbearing or distracting. I very much enjoyed the narration, but I did get the impression that the film was written without planning for it. As a result, sometimes the narration can actually have a detrimental effect on some of the scenes. A dialogue line might detract from a visual punch line, or the timing might be a little off. What I found interesting was how many scenes were still silent. I couldn't tell you what made Chaplin decide some scenes needed narration and others didn't, but I appreciate the restraint, and the understanding that sometimes, narration or dialogue would do more harm than good.I'm usually not that into old films, but The Gold Rush completely won me over. It has aged well, and the humor is still very funny. The style of story telling is different, to be sure, but still highly effective. Charlie Chaplin is a timeless performer, and I definitely recommend watching this movie."
gab-14712,"Jul 24, 2020",9/10,"When Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush was initially released in 1925, the director exclaimed, ""This is the film I want to be remembered for!"" Well Mr. Chaplin, we definitely remember you for this film. Even though he made many excellent films after this film's release, pundits consider this his greatest achievement. I was enamored with the film myself. For a silent film, it had a character-driven narrative and did not solely rely upon Chaplin's familiar humor, which remains excellent as always.There are two versions that the public is aware about; the 1925 silent version and a version edited by Chaplin in 1942 made for the audience that has grown accustomed to sound. He added a score and he made tweaks including changing the ending. Personally, I think the original version is the best because I really do adore the ending. Apparently, the ending was shot in terms of how Chaplin's love life was at the time. Both versions are incredible, but my preferable version was released in 1925.Chaplin, who also wrote the script, attempted to shoot the film on location in California. He eventually had to abandon those plans and shot the film on the studio's backlot. This movie features some well known comedy acts that you always hear about especially if you're taking a film class. We have the boot-eating scene, the roll dance, and the cabin in the storm sequence. These scenes were shot very well. Because of Chaplin's famous obsessive-compulsive disorder, it took more than 60 takes to shoot the shoe-eating segment. Yes, Chaplin wanted perfection and he often got it! This film happened to be the most expensive and longest comedy film at the time. 95 minutes does not sound much, but it was definitely new for those folks. Fortunately, the film became a box-office smash and is one of the silent film's most profitable pictures.The Little Tramp, or the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) is on his way to the Klondike to search for some gold. Conditions are brutal and there is little in the way of food or gold. He goes to the cabin where he meets Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen (who is wanted by the authorities). With no food available, Thanksgiving dinner consists only of a boot. When the Little Tramp finally reaches town, he meets Georgia (Georgia Hale). He falls in love with her, but he seems to have some competition for her heart. Can the Tramp strike it rich and win over Georgia's heart?Chaplin is Chaplin and he does his thing very well. Watching his performance, one can easily see why he is one of the best comedians and performers to grace this planet. No words express his comedic genius here. It's all about body movement and facial expressions that make us laugh. In today's age, that is beyond impressive. I was laughing and smiling throughout. That is how amazing Chaplin is. As for the supporting performances, they are excellent. Georgia Hale, who admired Chaplin for an incredibly long time, gives Chaplin an excellent female pairing.Let's say you have never seen a Chaplin film and you wanted a recommendation. I would not hesitate to allow myself to choose this film. It's funny and features all the legendary comedy Chaplin would be famous for. That said, it has a character-driven narrative that is dramatic and emotional, and Chaplin pulls it off very well. The Gold Rush is Chaplin at his best and it is not hard to see why you can call this a classic.My Grade: A"
sol-,"Sep 15, 2017",7/10,"Improperly prepared for Klondike's harsh weather conditions, a lone gold prospector has to share a cabin with another prospector, whose hunger often drives him insane, in this Charles Chaplin silent comedy. Proclaimed by Chaplin as the film by which he most wanted to be remembered, 'The Gold Rush' has gone onto much acclaim, but those expecting the charm of 'City Lights' and imaginative sets and situations of 'Modern Times' may be disappointed. To be fair, 'The Gold Rush' starts off quite well with lots of humorous situations at the outskirts cabin, including imagined chickens, persons blown in and out of doorways and a hilarious sequence in which Chaplin keeps trying to dodge a gun barrel during a fight, only to find the gun pointed in his face wherever he goes. Around a third of the way in though, Chaplin leaves the cabin and what follows is far less innovative as he becomes the subject of tricks and falls in love upon returning to town. There are some funny town sequences for sure (dancing with a dog leash) and there is a great bit involving a tilting cabin near the end, but the final two thirds of the film never recapture the magic of the first third. With so many jokes and ideas that have since been imitated (bread roll forks), this is an undeniably iconic comedy, but those keen on seeing Chaplin at his finest may wish to look elsewhere."
jluis1984,"Oct 11, 2006",10/10,"In the early years of cinema, actor and director Charlie Chaplin rose up to become one of the most important artists of his time, however, his attempt to make a serious drama in ""A Woman in Paris"" lead to his first major failure. But two years after that, Chaplin was still at the top of his game, and he decided to go back to what he liked the most and delivered a movie that would take his trademark style of pantomime to a new level. A film that would not only surpass the critical and commercial success he had with the Little Tramp's previous feature film, ""The Kid"", but would also become one of the most important silent films in history, and the highest grossing silent comedy film: ""The Gold Rush"".The film is the story of the Little Tramp (Chaplin) as a lone prospector during the Klondike Gold Rush. Hoping to find gold in the harsh territories of Alaska, the Tramp finds himself in many different adventures, where he'll face the danger of the mountain, the harsh winter and the pains of hunger in his quest for gold. However, the trip will also take him to meet several friendly, and not so friendly characters; such as fellow prospector Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) and outlaw Black Larsen (Tom Murray), as well as the beautiful Georgia (Georgia Hale).Inspired by the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin found in the hazardous quest for gold a theme for his perfect mixture of comedy and drama. At first sight, ""The Gold Rush"" may seem as just another of the Tramp's adventures, but this film goes beyond the slapstick and presents a testament of Chaplin's ideology about life: that there is no laugh without a tear, and that tragedy and comedy walk the very same path. ""The Gold Rush""'s plot is presented as a series of ""episodes"" in the Tramp's trip, sometimes more comedy than melodrama, sometimes the opposite, but always walking the fine line between both, making the film a unique comedy that never becomes tiresome nor boring.Chaplin allows himself some daring experimentation in ""The Gold Rush"" unseen in ""The Kid"", and that would lead to his avant-garde ""Modern Times"" in the future. With inventive special effects and his masterful use of pantomime he crafted unforgettable scenes of a force so powerful, that are now deeply rooted in our culture. His talent as director, polished in the many shorts he directed in his early career, is completely developed and balancing comedy and drama he moves from one to the other in a smooth fashion that lacks the manipulative sappiness of ""The Kid"".As always, Charlie Chaplin is superb in a character that he has now mastered. The Little Tramp may have started as a collection of mannerism, but now he has a personality of his own, and as a Lone Prospector, he seems to represent us, in our naive trip through the perils of life, on the search of something that may be what we want, but may not be what we need. Along Chaplin, the supporting cast is quite effective, and also have very developed personalities. Regular collaborator Mack Swain has a lot of funny scenes as Big Jim McKay, proving that Chaplin is not the only star of the show. Tom Murray delivers a sinister performance as Black Larsen and Malcolm Waite is simply perfect as the womanizer Jack Cameron.""The Gold Rush"" is probably the perfect silent comedy, in the sense that it was aware of its limitations and played with them in a cheerful way. Like other classics of the silent era, its use of image to tell the story is simply breathtaking, and one can imagine the sounds with only watching the film. This characteristic is what makes me think that the sound version (edited by Chaplin in 1942) is not only inferior, but a serious damage to the film. While Chaplin's intentions were definitely good, ""The Gold Rush"" is a film that works better in silent form, without the need of anyone narrating or explaining it because it explains itself on its own.Charlie Chaplin was an artist that really knew his craft (his preference for silent comedy shows this), and had a perfect understanding of human nature. Having lived in poverty in his young years, he knew better than anybody the value of a laugh in the harsher times, so probably he was the only one able to made a film like ""The Gold Rush"", the film that took Chaplin's comedy to the highest levels. 10/10"
sveknu,"May 16, 2005",5/10,"Personally, I don't think that this movie is as good as most people (and the IMDb-ranking) says that it is. Don't misunderstand me, I enjoyed the movie. But it wasn't as interesting as ""The Kid"" (one of Chaplins other movies), for example. I think this movie is a bit too long. It's a mute movie, after all. I'm really glad that I watched the newer version, where all the text boards were removed and replaced with a narrator. Fortunately, this made the movie a bit shorter. The movie consists of two almost separated plots who are tied together at the end of the movie. Both plots are somewhat interesting, but personally I liked the ""wilderness/cabin/gold digger-plot"" (the first part of the movie) much better. The ending is fortunately quite good in this movie."
zutterjp48,"Dec 16, 2019",10/10,"All the genius of Charles Chaplin !! The Gold Rush is a brilliant mute comedy about this moment of the history of the United States !! All the adventurers became crazy for gold.And then Charles Chaplin made this touching and funny comedy.I remember very well the dance of the breads, the cooking of the shoes, the illusion of chicken , the cabin going up and down and also the romantic part of the film.
Absolutely genial and entertaining."
jmbates-89695,"Sep 12, 2018",10/10,"I love how Chaplin can make his movies so funny without saying a word. With the classic goofy guy trying to get the girl. This movie was similar to his movie the circus, because it starts out in a completely different situation then he ends up. He also issued his exaggerated facial expressions to make people laugh."
evanston_dad,"Dec 9, 2005",9/10,"""The Gold Rush,"" perhaps more than any other Chaplin film, best captures that elusive, sad quality about the little tramp that permeates so many of his films. What is it exactly that's so sad about Chaplin, given the fact that he's always doing something zany and laugh out loud funny? It's that he always seems to be an outsider; he never quite fits in. There's always someone bigger, stronger, richer, better looking than him. And I think that's what movie audiences responded to during his hey-day and what they're still responding to now.Perhaps no other scene in a Chaplin film (at least of the ones I've seen) captures this feeling more than the one in ""The Gold Rush"" where Chaplin has gone to a great deal of effort to prepare a New Year's dinner and is stood up by his date, spending his New Year's alone. This scene is almost unbearably sad, so thank God it's surrounded by scene after scene that will have you giggling. This is the movie with the famous ""dancing potatoes"" scene, and wait till you see Chaplin eat his boot for dinner, slurping up his shoelace like it's a spaghetti noodle.I strongly recommend Chaplin films to anyone who is moderately interested in early cinema but is turned off by the idea of silent pictures. He's so expressive and so fun to watch that I guarantee you you'll forget that you're watching a silent film. Even after movies went to sound, Chaplin continued to make virtually silent pictures, and you don't even feel the absence.Grade: A"
etziksegal,"Sep 6, 2019",10/10,"The true art of acting and cinematic filming is astounding, considering how the message was conveyed, without all the special effects Hollywood puts out today. The talent is long gone and everything is a remake today. Many of the remakes are horrible."
ssssgelojun,"Jun 29, 2020",10/10,"Every movement and every expression of Chaplin, the master of mime, is flawless.He always played the little guy, and what he wanted was, of course, the original purpose of comedy:Let the audience laugh, but the Angle of the small figures can also show the imprint of the overall environment, the ugly heart of others.It just seems like a story about a little guy who goes for gold and ends up rich and in love.But behind the laughter was the American gold rush, and the greedy men in the gold rush.The film's nonstop soundtrack is like watching an opera and evokes cat and mouse.This laughter continued until the Christmas Eve when He slept alone on his desk and dreamed of being with Gioia, which reminded me that comedy is at its core a tragedy."
gea-79784,"Oct 11, 2017",7/10,"I'm not a very big fan of silent films, but Gold Rush was funny enough to hold my attention for the whole film. Charlie Chaplin revises his famous role of the little tramp, this time he's out to make it big in the Alaskan gold rush. Chaplin is just exquisite as always, he's so good at acting and being funny using just his movements and mannerisms. He works especially well alongside Mack Swain who plays another prospector. The scenes where Swain sees Chaplin as a giant chicken so he chases him in circles around the cabin are hysterical. This is where the film shines and is the best utilization i have seen of a silent film."
SmileysWorld,"Jan 22, 2008",9/10,"There are two different versions of this film.I was unaware when I rented the DVD that this was true,and the first of the two versions I viewed was the edited for sound 1942 rerelease.This has none other than Chaplin himself narrating the film.While I found the film to be good,I found myself being slightly annoyed and distracted by Chaplin's chatter,though I am sure he had the best of intentions.After viewing this,I decided to rent the bonus disc which included the original totally silent release from 1925.Though it is a restored version (the piano soundtrack is brand new),I found myself able to enjoy it a lot better.Charlie Chaplin was a genius as a film maker and performer,and it shows here.The Gold Rush is typical Chaplin with its combination of humor and romance,and it even has an edge of the seat thrill toward the end that will rival anything you see today.It's a great film,but when you see it,see it in its original and best silent form."
paleowildchild,"Jan 30, 2021",6/10,"Charlie Chaplins's film The Gold Rush was hilarious for its time. However, from a modern standpoint, it was not the funniest film I've seen.Charlie's choice of clothing was a commentary in and of its self. His clothes were almost clown-like, from the oversized pants to the shoes that were two sizes too big. He bore a striking resemblance to a clown of that era. However, his clothes were also quite dapper. His cane and bowler hat made him look more like a gentleman.Charlie Chaplin was well versed in roles in the film industry. He acted in, directed, and composed music for The Gold Rush. He was a brilliant and genius actor for his time.From a plot perspective, the movie is very weak. It is lacking in the necessary elements to give the story depth, such as character development, and a strong goal that the characters are striving to compete. It's also very predictable, they get the gold, they lose the gold, they get the gold again and consequently win the girl. The storyline isn't the main focus. rather the humorous incidents within the film - were meant to be the main focus."
mrbisco,"Feb 26, 2003",5/10,"This was my first Chaplin film and I'm not terribly impressed.  I can see why he is so popular as his character (the tramp) is definitely memorable.The movie has a few good bits, but altogether it doesn't really hold up to a Buster Keaton film.  This movie is 72 mins. long and I kept pausing it cuz I was bored.The bread roll dance (later done by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon) was fairly clever, and I'd have to say that was the high point of the film for me.I gave it a 5.  Average film.  I am not going to rank it lower because something tells me not to."
mahmus,"May 26, 2020",10/10,"While I still mantain that City Lights is my favorite Charlie Chaplin movie, The Gold Rush is a close second.It's probably Chaplin's most dramatically effective film, the one where I feel the most sympathy for the little tramp.I particularly love the new year's eve sequence.From the bittersweet imaginary dinner scene where Chaplin makes two bread rolls dance, to the new year celebration where the the party goers sing ""Auld Laud Syne"" while the tramp waits alone in a cabin for a date that will never come.It's one of the most heartbreaking moments in Chaplin's filmography.Such a great movie.Also, watch the original 1925 silent version. Avoid the 1942 version."
pooch-8,"Jan 28, 1999",N/A,"In a story often related by film scholars to wide-eyed students, Chaplin set about creating the comic scenarios for his 1925 classic (I would use the word masterpiece, but he seemed to have made a number of these) The Gold Rush after being inspired by the true tales of cannibalism among the stranded Donner party.  That Chaplin could take such a morbid topic and spin it into hilarious comedy is a testament to his skill, particularly as a performer -- the moments where he is imagined as a giant chicken or eats his boot and shoelaces as if they were veal cutlets are still astonishingly fresh.  Other set pieces, like the teetering cabin and the dancing dinner rolls, still delight audiences and continue to cement The Gold Rush's legacy."
caspian1978,"Jun 27, 2001",9/10,"Make them laugh, make them laugh. The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other. Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy. Even though Chaplin loves to press political, economical, or social messages in his films, The Gold Rush remains true to its genre. It is a comedy non the less. Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss, Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss. This is suppose to be a comedy!"
TheLittleSongbird,"Aug 14, 2010",10/10,"I love Charlie Chaplin and I love his films. As much as I love The Tramp(his most touching), City Lights(my personal favourite of his movies), Modern Times(has my favourite soundtrack of all the Charlie Chaplin movies, love Smile), Limelight(a beautiful film) and The Great Dictator(love the speech at the end), The Gold Rush is one of his more light-hearted films.The Gold Rush looks very nice, with lovely cinematography, sets and costumes. The story is simple, but really well-done, fast-paced and involving, while the direction is very fine. The performances are first-rate, Georgia Hale is beautiful and contemptuous but it is Chaplin's performance that holds The Gold Rush together. But I cannot not mention the comedy, there are so many wonderful moments that are well and truly hysterical including the opening sequence, the dance of the bread rolls, Chaplin and his companion hallucinating(the companion hallucinating that Chaplin is a very edible chicken), the way Chaplin ate the shoe leather, Chaplin dancing with the dog tied to his belt and the final scene in the cabin on the cliff.Overall, a golden treasure from a comedy genius. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
pyrocitor,"Jan 3, 2009",10/10,"After an unsuccessful attempt at melodrama in A Woman in Paris, a conscious attempt to break away from the silly and simplistic entertainment of his early cinematic career and say something important as a serious artist, Charlie Chaplin was forced to return to just the sort of crowd pleasing comedy he had just unsuccessfully made a bid to deviate from. The crucial difference was, despite his return to his defining genre, Chaplin had not abandoned his newfound sense of cinematic grandeur or determination to accomplish something more worthwhile than throwaway entertainment through film. This rekindled cinematic ambition, combined with inspiration from a series of slides detailing a vast march of Klondike gold prospectors and a gruesome account of an expedition leading to cannibalism, led to The Gold Rush, a picture just as grand, vast and engaging as any of the dramas Chaplin might have initially wanted to emulate. However, it is through Chaplin's commitment to mining the most humane and heart-warming of comedy out of the most unlikely sources that the film is firmly cemented as an abiding classic of the era.When recalled from a contemporary standpoint, the film is often remembered simply as a series of comic setpieces: Chaplin forced to scramble up the near vertical floor of a cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff, Chaplin cooking and eating a shoe to cope with famine, and the timeless dance of the dinner rolls endlessly referenced from sources as varied as 1993's Benny and Joon to the Simpsons. But what is often neglected is the sheer craftsmanship and incredibly dedication Chaplin invested in such sequences - the tension and sheer cinematic prowess demonstrated in the rocking cabin sequence alone are enough to still make it almost impossibly breathtaking and tense even when viewed over 80 years after the fact. Through such sequences, The Gold Rush demonstrates Chaplin's maturation as a filmmaker, from simply a skilled entertainer to a genuinely capable director capable of extracting not only laughs, but gasps of white knuckle fear, and unquenchable tears of fundamentally human pathos.As such, to reduce such a universally laudable film to a series of extended gags would not only be an understatement, but downright unreasonable, as the film pulses with vivid life, emotion and utter credibility, despite its exterior dressings as a simple silly comedy. Through reviving his immortal tramp figure, Chaplin gained a near peerless conduit for not only comedy but social criticism and satire, not only sending up the inhumane atrocities of Klondike prospecting life, but of class struggles and the adherence to them preventing proper human interaction. When the tramp enters a mining town, he is scarcely given any more reprieve than in the winter harshness of the mountain prospecting, so beset is he by the scorn and derision of the upper class villagers, adding conflict to a potentially budding romance and adding an ironic tinge to an otherwise saccharine ending. The film also excels technically to an extent Chaplin had previously not achieved, with subtle but deceptively inventive camera-work perfectly complimenting the flavour of the scene, whether creating a bold, sweeping statement through the iconic long shot of a weary train of prospectors traversing a mountainside, or with tender close-ups extracting every inch of emotion from Chaplin's quivering face. Far from a simple string of gags, The Gold Rush makes its mark as an unassuming cinematic masterpiece, both technically and in terms of emotional storytelling.It goes without saying that Chaplin's skills as a performer only continued to improve with each film, and The Gold Rush is no exception. Demonstrating not only his astonishing physical prowess and ability to meticulously undertake precarious stunts and comic gags, Chaplin also showcases an almost unprecedented sentimental side, with his beloved tramp figure proving an utterly irresistible underdog hero who, when beset by adversity, cannot help but genuinely capture the viewer's heart. Chaplin is also gifted with a highly talented supporting cast to play off of, including the admirably ferocious Mack Swain as a brutish fellow prospector and Georgia Hale, noteworthy for being a laudably ambiguous love interest rather than the one dimensional beauties often showcased in Chaplin's films.Arguably one of the strongest cinematic works produced during the silent era, The Gold Rush is more likely to evoke refreshingly genuine raucous laughter, heartfelt tears and finally leave the viewer with an unquenchable beaming smile on their face than almost any film made before or since. Chaplin's opus is a masterpiece of emotional storytelling on an impressively grand scale as well as a comedic classic, easily meriting the director/star's declaration of it being the singular film out of his entire body of work he would most like to be remembered by.-10/10"
Seraphion,"Aug 29, 2014",6/10,"Like all Chaplin movies, the earlier work has the significant distinction of having many studio-shot scenes with contrasting details. A feat that's quite elaborate and full of effort for the time. Like all Cjaplin movies, The Gold Rush depicts his signature character The Tramp, although here he was named the Lone Prospector. I like how the movie depicts the poor man rising up to betterment of his life, an image that many can relate at the time. Chaplin's story telling also comes out as he did all the narratives himself in this movie. The other cast did quite okay here. Georgia Hall nicely complete the angles for this movie."
AlanSmithee0,"Sep 11, 2003",10/10,"This little film is a great display of the true comedic genius of Charlie Chaplin and his ""Little Tramp"" character. The film isn't powerfully dramatic but still stands the test of the time in terms of comedy. Chaplin's elaborate and well-prepared sight gags really show how his style differed from the frantic & wild pace of Max Sennatt's silent films. Plus his ""Tramp"" character is a very sympathetic and human character as you do feel his emotions as he tries to win Georgia's heart. Overall Chaplin did a fantastic job on this classic and it deserves recognition as one of the best comedies of all-time. Without a doubt, a solid 10/10!"
cinema_student2010,"Dec 17, 2010",5/10,"I had to watch this movie for a class. I know that silent films is where are cinema history began, but i have to say i find them utterly boring.I was honestly bored and found myself drifting away from the movie, it just didn't hold my attention. At least Chaplin comedy can be fabulously expressed even without words. For example there's a scene where their so hungry there imaging a chicken and chasing each other around. The scene could be funny even if taken out of context. There's also a scene where hes shoveling snow, but not realizing that hes making an even bigger pile out of what hes shoveling. I found myself laughing quite a bit during that scene. The scenes do seem a little bit over done at times though.The movie is about just what is sounds like, Chaplin finds him self searching for gold,and comedy ensues. The props for The Gold Rush were noticeable bad, very fake. For example there's the cabin scenes. Everything just looks like a set, especially when the cabin is about to slide off the side of the mountain, the scenes/effects(all the back and forth motion) is not very authentic. But for the time period its completely understandable."
dougdoepke,"Feb 8, 2012",N/A,"No need to repeat consensus points. What grabs me is how good the staging is for the time. The snowy effects whether real or artificial look surprisingly like they're really in the far north. And how about that teetering cabin—I'm still holding on from that one. And I'd like to know how they did the teetering interior—did they actually see-saw it in a studio or did Chaplin and Swain simulate with crawling. Whatever, it's still a great scene.What's stayed with me over time is the little table ballet with the two fork legs and potato shoes (I think). It's so marvelously executed with such rhythm and dexterity. No doubt about it, Chaplin is one of our greatest physical comedians. The movie shows how much can be done with a single set and a ton of comedic imagination, along with a highly talented production crew.A genuine classic."

xXxVinDiesel67,"Oct 20, 2004",10/10,"I thought this was such an incredible film. It is definitely my favorite one of all he has made that I've seen so far. Both the old & new one of this film is amazing. I personally love in the new one when they play the theme song from the Disney movie ""Sleeping Beauty."" And I love the original ending when Charlie & Georgia kiss, it was so cute!!! I definitely recommend this film to EVERYONE, as well as trying to get your hands all as many of his 89 films as possible. I own about 60 as of now, and will be getting 12 a.s.a.p. I am such a huge fan of him, and this film just made me an even bigger fan. It is so funny, my favorite parts are when he eats his shoe, when he first sees Georgia(i love the little song that plays every time he sees her), when he does the dance w/ the forks & the rolls. I promise you, if you see this movie, you all will love it, it is incredible, so see it!!! LOL"
Mr_Ram,"Jun 17, 1999",9/10,"The Tramp truly was, and still is, everyman.  Simpleness is key.  Georgia barely touches the true essence of Chaplin when she says, ""He's wonderful!"" The brilliance lies within his ability to create cartoonish and surreal atmospheres, and imbue them with precise human nature and emotion.  The ending was a bit 'ehh', however thoughts may change as a second viewing -- the 1945 re-issue (with Chaplin narration and score) -- is forthcoming. Our (cinematic) World needs more Chaplins, and  reality needs imagination to inspire greatness."

I certainly KNEW who Charlie Chaplin was, but I had relegated silent film as an outdated technology. Sort of like extinct dinosaurs - no need to revisit that.But there is great humor here, no matter what the year on the calendar. Her we are 80 years later and this stuff is still funny.Who doesn't laugh at him dancing with the dog tied to his belt - or when he dances with the rolls. And the way he ate the shoe leather!

There are plenty of great scenes:Chaplin and Mack Swain in the cabin,crazy with hunger and cabin fever,the touching New Year's Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliff.The later version which was released with added narration and music wasn't as good as the original,but easier for modern audiences to watch."

In my opinion, I found it a tad bit dull compared to precious movies of his. Maybe I'm being too comparative, but I didn't find this movie as thrilling as some of his other concepts. I don't know, I think the plot kept bouncing around to characters that were in the first part and I didn't understand why some characters needed to come into the plot again when Charlie was dealing with Georgia in the dance hall. It's not a bad film; far from it, in fact. For my personal tastes, though, I wished it was something more gripping. I felt like he could have done a lot with the idea of being trapped in the cold north with arctic animals and the like, instead of it drifting back to Georgia. I think it would have made a funnier movie if it kept to the main point in the beginning and went with it. I felt a little disorganized watching it because I didn't know what to focus on in the main storyline.I give this film 7 out of 10 mostly because of how it was executed, so it wasn't as high a rating as before. But, overall, it's a cute movie but not his best.~ Vicky"
ArtVandelayImporterExporter,"Apr 11, 2024",3/10,"Chaplin had a formula for The Tramp: outcast scuffles his way through life yet somehow finds love and prevails against the odds.The Charlie Maudlin approach works if we fall in love with the female lead as quickly as The Tramp does. They must suffer their travails and enjoy their ''triumphs"" together. Then we can overlook when Chaplin lays it on a bit thick.What are we supposed to do with Georgia Hale's character, then? She doesn't even appear until Act 2. And when she does, she's a narcissistic glorified call girl in Bumbfk, Alaska, hitching a ride with some bully gold miner. She and her entirely unattractive (and one fat) friends treat The Tramp abominably.Sadly, The Tramp has been stuck in a cabin with two fat guys for so long he's starved for female company. His efforts to woo Georgia aren't romantic, they reek of sick desperation.When one of his cabin buddies hits the motherlode, fortune favors The Tramp. So we get a resolution that no way, no how, no matter one's romantic inclinations, strikes the right notes. The Tramp might not realize it, but we know he's still a first-class sap.Acts 1 and 3 are basically set pieces in a snowbound cabin. It feels like the same gag gets recycled to pad the running time. It wore out my patience at times.If you take out the famous dancing potatoes scene, this movie is a frozen turdsicle."

DEATHS: H. Rider Haggard, Thomas R. Marshall.KEVIN: We now come to our second Charlie Chaplin film and quite possibly his seminal masterpiece, 1925's The Gold Rush. This movie is wonderful. I laughed really hard right from the beginning. I love the opening where the Tramp first walks on screen, still with his hat and shoes and cane even though there's snow everywhere and he really looks out of his element. I think my favorite comedic beat in the film was the scene where the cabin is teetering over the edge of the cliff. That scene is even better in the 1941 version due to the added tension of sound effects. Another great thing in this movie for me was the irresistible Georgia Hale. Every moment she's on screen everything just lights up. I hear Chaplin was quite the control freak with his films, and I'm sure even he must have been mesmerized with what she did.DOUG: In June 1925, after nearly two years of production, Charles Chaplin finally releases the film for which he is best remembered, and with good reason: The Gold Rush is not just a great comedy, but a great film. And not just because it contains some of Chaplin's best remembered scenes. The gourmet shoe-eating scene is wonderful, the way he is determined to enjoy every bit of the shoe, sucking on the nails like bones, twisting the shoe laces like spaghetti. The scene with the house teetering on the edge of the cliff is one of the greatest sustained comedy scenes ever put on film. And everyone loves when starving Big Jim hallucinates the Tramp as a giant chicken. But there's something more here. Chaplin isn't just interested in telling jokes, but there's a rather poignant story happening here in the romance between the Tramp and Georgia. The scene where he imagines Georgia and her friends enjoying his New Year's Eve party is especially poignant, as he performs the 'Oceana Roll' with a pair of rolls on forks. Interesting this is Chaplin's only silent comedy that he filmed with a complete story ready before filming; interesting too that Chaplin chose this film to redo with new sound and narration in 1942. When you watch the later version, it is cool to realize that it's really Chaplin's voice you're hearing. There were a few noticeable alterations in the two versions, one being that instead of the Tramp reading a note from Georgia that he thinks is for him, he really receives a (different) note from Georgia to him. I prefer the later version of that scene, but I prefer the ending of the earlier version where they kiss; the revised version seems to end rather abruptly.Last film: Strike (1925). Next film: Phantom of the Opera (1925).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each film before we watch the next, never reading the other's review before we finish our own. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise."
dataconflossmoor,"Feb 15, 2007",10/10,"Just like Orson Wells, Marlon Brando and Katherine Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin is a classic in the movie industry!! The king of silent films is attributed with making slapstick humor one of the stellar accomplishments in the entertainment business!! Slapstick comedy is predicated on a lot of physical humor, often times, slapstick is underrated in terms of the immense amount of talent it actually requires!! Lucille Ball got her start by emulating slapstick icons such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and later, she instilled slapstick stunts in her renowned comedy series ""I Love Lucy""... The film, ""Gold Rush"" is hilarious in it's exaggeration of calamity!! Charlie Chaplin is tremendous in engaging in a befuddled demeanor about his basic struggle for survival!! ""Gold Rush"" was listed by one movie critic's list as the best film ever!! Why do you suppose this is? I would say that it is mostly on account of the cunningly successful aspects of silliness that are incorporated in the making of this movie!! Another big reason would be the flippant approach slapstick artist Charlie Chaplin orchestrates when encountering one predicament after the other in this film!! These actions are so overdone that they are hysterically funny!! Charlie Chaplin executes all of the necessary acrobatics of chicanery very effectively!! In the case of ""Gold Rush"" Charlie Chaplin is so intense in his ludicrous actions, that he effortlessly makes ""Gold Rush"" a masterpiece!! Take into account that it is 1925, before the film goer was barraged with a bevy of special effects, and you, (being part of the movie audience) will recognize how well put together this movie really is!! The innocuous charisma of a Nicklelodian style film is often times mollified, and is discarded by many people as being cavalier in it's attempt to attain a recognizable prowess as far as being an assertively marvelous flick is concerned!! Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of the film ""Gold Rush"" This film is outstanding!! The licorice shoes were an added whimsical element to making ""Gold Rush"" funny as well!! I strongly recommend that you rent this movie and watch it!! This is without a doubt, an extremely top notch film!! It is not always rated #1 on every critic's list, but, it is always listed as one of the best movies ever made by virtually every movie expert!! The latest review list that AFI came out with ""Gold Rush"" was rated 58th out of the top 100 American films ever made!!"
RodrigAndrisan,"Mar 23, 2021",10/10,"Soon, in just 4 years, the film will turn 100 years since it was made. And after so long, it's more than current, it's overwhelming. The scene when the two fight with the rifle pointed to Chaplin, the scene when they eat the boot, then when the big guy thinks that Chaplin it's a chicken, when Chaplin is burying the rifle in the snow, then the dance scene when Chaplin's pants fall off, followed
by the dog which is tied to the end of the rope with which Chaplin tightens his pants, and more, all are scenes of reference in the history of world cinema, scenes that inspired many other filmmakers from then until today. And they
certainly will inspire and from now on. Georgia Hale was very beautiful!"
Boba_Fett1138,"Aug 28, 2007",8/10,"It's a sweet movie with some really sweet moments, thanks to Charlie Chaplin's character and of course the way he portrays him. Chaplin always has been great putting effective emotions in a purely comical movie. You always feel and sympathize for his little tramp character.Interestingly enough Charles Chaplin himself in the '40's revived the movie with the addition of spoken dialog-, done by himself and sound. It's not always necessary, since the images themselves speak for their own but it's still interesting to experience because it makes clear what he himself initially always wanted us to see and hear.It's a real Charlie Chaplin movie, also not in the least because he directed, wrote, composed, produced and edited but I mean especially of course his acting. His movements are particularly great but so are his overall comical acting skills. Not hard to see why he's regarded by many as the great movie comedian/entertainer of all time.The story is a sweet one and it perfectly gives Chaplin the opportunity to show of his skills. Though admittedly I didn't like the first halve of the movie as much as the second. Somehow this always seems to be the case with silent comedies. The two parts also don't feel really jointed. The first part is most slapstick, while the second part is slapstick but with substance, with of course also the great and classic cabin ending.Great must-see from the silent-era, both the original- and narrated version.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
anton-6,"Jun 16, 2001",10/10,The tramp ventures into Alaska looking for gold. He gets mixed up with some burly characters and falls in love with the beautiful Georgia. He tries to win her heart with his singular charm.............Chaplin as the tramp always looking for adventure and romance. I think this is one of the funniest movies ever made.I still think that modern times is better(my favorite film off all time) but this is a masterpiece.
Filmdokter,"Aug 30, 2021",6/10,"The Gold Rush is a well made film. It is a typical Chaplin film: funny with a heart of gold. The Oceana Roll dance and the final 'cliffhanger' scene are memorable and classic Chaplin silent comedy. But apart from those scenes, The Gold Rush as a film is a bit too much a combination of individual scenes / sketches and therefor misses some overall strong narrative that you do see in for instance The Kid."
jeffhaller,"Nov 6, 2023",10/10,One of my very favorite movies. I watched it today for the first time in years. Never loved it as much. In truth it is really a spiritual movie: Don't ever give up. Things might turn out better than you ever anticipated. And let's not forget in the 75 minutes you will have some of the greatest laughs you have ever experienced. And that score! It is like listening to an opera. It can take a great scene and send it soaring. It isn't easy for us today to judge silent movie acting but Chaplin and his troupe only inspire. There is a lot of tough things in this movie. The characters endure some tough stuff. Then watch Chaplin savor that shoe.
Spuzzlightyear,"Jan 29, 2006",7/10,"One of the quissential silent movies ever made, 'The Gold Rush' is by far Chaplin's best work, has a lot of signature pieces in it, and shows great characterization of the tramp character (eg, putting him in such a strange locale, the Alaskan Gold Rush). The story is so simple that anyone can follow it and enjoy it, from 5-500, and it's ideas have been copied numerous times. I've seen this maybe 5 times now, and, although I've grown to like other silent comedians better, it was a pleasure to see this again. My only other comment, and this is not a complaint but rather an awkward aside. The version I saw quite recently was the 1942 version which is the feature version on the new DVD edition of the film. In this version, instead of inter titles, there's audio commentary. This was all done by Chaplin. While it's fun to listen to (Chaplin seems to be having a ball doing this). I really wonder why this needed to be done, and not just let the original stand on it's own merits. I guess silents were so out of vogue that when it was being re-released Chaplin did this to try to broaden the audience? That would be my guess."
Kdosda_Hegen,"Aug 20, 2020",4/10,"Only the first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes are about gold rush. The whole middle is a poor cliche love story. It had some cool scenes in the beginning and the end, but the whole middle segment is pure boredom and lame."
bturtle_17,"Aug 16, 2001",N/A,"Watching ""The Gold Rush"" was somewhat like listening to great music on a scratchy old record player instead of on a state of the art CD player; the experience is just as exciting, but it takes a little getting used to.  It's the same thing all right, but there is just enough difference to slightly throw you off. After a while you forget about the minor technical variations and enjoy the wonderful music.Once I adjusted to the ""silence"" of Charlie Chaplin's 1925 silent film, I was able to watch it like any other movie.  I could laugh, sympathize, hope, and loathe for the characters, all of the things a movie can make you do. All it took was appreciation of the effort it took people like Chaplin who essentially made something from nothing. In this case, that something is a funny, innovative, and entertaining movie.""The Gold Rush"" revolves around Chaplin's character, the Lone Prospector, in the Yukon where many men seek a fortune in gold. He seeks shelter in a cabin inhabited by wanted criminal Black Larson (Tom Murray) who tries to get rid of Chaplin in one of the funniest scenes of the movie, in which a strong wind prevents Chaplin from leaving. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has found gold, also enters the cabin.  Larson goes out to look food, leaving Big Jim and Chaplin together.  At one point, Big Jim gets so hungry he sees an illusion of Chaplin as a giant chicken. When I saw this scene, I realized that it was probably the first time that this invention, which I have seen in many modern movies and television shows to the point that it is overused, was applied in film.Further along in the film, the Chaplin character visits a small boom town where he meets and falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), who only uses him to make ladies' man Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite) jealous and regards the little shabbily dressed man as a joke. At this point, I didn't care that the characters didn't really speak or that the film was in black and white. I was too involved in the story to be bothered by the rudimental aspects of the film. As the Lone Prospector, Chaplin evoked my sympathy as well as laughter.  I found myself hoping for him to be happy, wanting to see the underdog eventually come out on top.While it is impossible to ignore the movie as a silent film, it is equally impossible to ignore it as a great comedy that could capably rival any modern comedy, and, like Chaplin's character, come out on top. It is the original that all others follow, and definitely worth renting even, and especially, if you have never before seen a silent film."
Captain_Couth,"Mar 9, 2009",10/10,"The Gold Rush (1925) was a big undertaking for Charles Chaplin. A lot of his time and effort went into the production of this film. During pre-production, he tried to shoot in the Yukon but that proved to be not a sound idea. So he shot the opening scenes in Truckee, California using some local vagabonds as extras. Charlie Chaplin stars as a prospector who tries his luck looking for gold in the Great North. What he discovers is a lot of other things and a little something about the human condition.A few memorable scenes stick out, one Chaplin starving up to a point where he has to eat his boot (made out of licorice), Chaplin and his companion hallucinating when they run out of things to eat, the iconic opening sequence and the ever famous dancing rolls. I have seen both versions of the film. One thing I didn't like that Chaplin did was that he tinkered with his films in the later years. He re-edited the film and added a narration and cut out several scenes. Despite the alterations, it's an awesome film.Highest recommendation possible"
secondtake,"Sep 9, 2010",9/10,"The Gold Rush (1925)If you see this classic Charlie Chaplin movie, it better be the silent version, if only because this is the pure intention, uncompromised. The 1942 version is a little shorter and faster, but it has Chaplin giving narration instead of using the inter-titles, and he says unnecessary stuff, and it interferes.The best parts of this classic as so good, and so honestly original, and so perfectly unashamedly comic, there is nothing like it. Eating the shoe, or getting out of the tilting house? Sheer brilliance, even eighty years later. I laughed out loud and often.There is also that key ingredient to every great film (it seems), a romance, and a funny surprise twist to the plot in the last ten minutes or so. Chaplin the tramp rises above, and yet ends, by slight of hand, as the tramp, or as a rich sophisticated man pretending to be the tramp. Which is what he was.The plot has its slow points, and overly sentimental aspects (including the romance), and it is sometimes bordering on slapstick silly rather than elegantly physical and inventively funny. But the big effect is just joyous. Chaplin"
filipemanuelneto,"Mar 16, 2020",10/10,"This film is, for me, the most striking of the silent film era, for all reasons. Her story is deeply touching and tells of a love story between a vagabond (the famous Charlô, as he is called in Portugal) and a young woman, in the context of the Alaskan gold rush.The film is entirely Chaplin. He's the main actor, he stars brilliantly, he directs, he writes the script, he's a stage animal, he even orchestrates the music! A complete, multifaceted, brilliant artist, who in this film shows us all his strength and talent. Mack Swain, Georgia Hale and Tom Murray also looked very good to me, but they never quite match Chaplin's mastery, which seems to be a general rule of all films where he participated as an actor.Being a silent film, music is a dominant element throughout the film, whether through specific songs, either through incidental music or leitmotives. Everything sounds wonderfully well and matches harmoniously with what we see on the screen. The film intelligently bets on body language in combination with written lines and dialogues. The sets and costumes, as well as the contrast, the light, everything was meticulously done and helps to make this film a pearl, full of international historical and cultural value."
liammitchellHVCC,"Sep 19, 2020",10/10,"This 1925 version, although cut together, displays the absolute genius that was the young Charlie Chaplin. It is a perfect display of everything that makes silent film incredible; intense action interspersed with hilarious comedy, vivid story telling through action alone, and an incredible early understanding of lighting, framing, and stage arrangement. I highly recommend this film for anyone that's looking to get started watching some old silent classics.Also, there's a fluffy dog in it, so you can't go wrong."
Beta_Gallinger,"Dec 21, 2007",8/10,"I never actually sat down to watch a silent movie from start to finish until earlier this year. Right now, I still haven't seen too many, but recently, for the first full-length silent comedy to see, I chose ""The Gold Rush"", a film written, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, a highly renowned filmmaker of his time, as I was aware of this movie's wide appeal, as well as the wide appeal of much of Chaplin's other work. I wasn't as impressed with it as much as many others have been, but all in all, it was a good experience.Set in the year 1898, during the gold rush of the time (hence the title of the film), Chaplin stars as a silly prospector, one of the many who have bravely come up to face the harsh weather conditions of Alaska, in search for gold! After struggling through a blizzard, he comes across a cabin. From there, much lies ahead for him. He experiences being marooned in the cabin with a fellow prospector named Big Jim McKay, both of them without food, and also falls in love with a woman he meets in Alaska named Georgia, and attempts to win her heart!""The Gold Rush"" definitely has some very funny and memorable gags. The two isolated prospectors eating a boiled boot, due to the fact they have no real food to eat, is definitely one of them. Gagwise, there are many more highlights in the film. The humour is very visual, with a lot of slapstick, which I usually like, and here is no exception. For the most part during the film, if I wasn't laughing, I think I was usually smiling. This 1925 Chaplin film also has some serious scenes, which works fairly well, and social commentary. I guess there's not much I'm saying, if anything, that hasn't already been said about ""The Gold Rush"". Yes, it was made over eighty years ago, but has aged well."
questl-18592,"Jul 27, 2022",7/10,"This was officially my first foray into both Chaplin and silent film and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Chaplin isn't what I expected him to be, I was expecting nothing but old school pratfalls and got completely blindsided by how heartfelt he was. When he has those moments of loss and despair, the few happy ones, they really are felt. Beyond that, I was chuckling frequently during this. I don't think I ever reached full-on laughter but it was still a really fun, enjoyable watch.With all that said, I doubt I'd recommend this to most people. I just can't see going up to one of my co-workers and say, ""Oh man, you HAVE to check out The Gold Rush!"" But for film buffs? Oh yeah, definitely watch this. If for nothing else, the experience and the addition to your film repertoire is a great addition. The fact that it's pleasant and fun is just icing on the cake."

chaos-rampant,"Sep 30, 2011",N/A,"To be perfectly honest, I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to. Right down to my fundamental worldview, I am a Buster Keaton person, the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness. The world as I understand it just doesn't work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay. So wishing it did only fosters more pain.This is actually worst than The Kid in this respect. Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl, but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold. Oh, though filthy rich at that point, when in the end he falls practically in the girl's arms he is again dressed like a tramp - meaning, no doubt, he is still the same person - but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial, worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul, here he gets both. There is not even the thought of a compromise.Yet I can't help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplin's cosmology; the mysterious, elusive fates - seemingly random, but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose - that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocks.Nowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene. The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside, the reality thought to be known, understood, domesticated into order, but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void. So, every step inside, taken casually, without much thought, is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death. 'Blissful ignorance', the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabin.It is a powerful cosmologic symbol, what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma, fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life. With both gold and love, impossible love with the dream girl, as the chimeras that trick the mind.So Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level, as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside, but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate - or he does, is terrified, and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy- tale.So however well-meant, it's a dishonest, patronizing vision of bliss. Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging, but eventually benevolent whims of providence. It's all made right again, more than right.Notice how well integrated is this notion inside the film, proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the point-of-view of the tramp, who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger soul-defining mechanisms that shape his life, that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lesson.So instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance, or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill, just wait and it'll all work out in the end. It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance, with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the film.Sure, it is occasionally very funny, inventive. But we're talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film - and, film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life, life itself."
zzhhhqing,"May 25, 2020",10/10,"How lonely can a person design such a moving plot? Chaplin's eyes are so beautiful, one is this one, and the other is the light of the city. When he stares at you with a slightly sad and sincere look, no girl will be melted by him? In the New Year, we are very touched by the long chorus of friendship, and everyone is singing the trapeze on the bus in the night. I especially like this kind of bridge."
Steffi_P,"Sep 7, 2010",10/10,"Sandwiched in between the failure of his non-comedy A Woman of Paris and his final days as a silent star in which he was up against the coming of sound, Charlie Chaplin made his most stupendous and expensive film to date, aptly named The Gold Rush. It became the work of which he was most proud, and the one he wanted to be best remembered for in years to come.But for all its grandiosity, the stuff The Gold Rush is made of is the purist Chaplin simplicity. We open, as we so often did in his short pictures, with the formal establishment of the film's setting, in this case an icy mountain range at the height of the Klondike frenzy, a world into which toddles the little tramp. His entrance here is funny purely because of the absurdness of his being here, and his utter inappropriateness for this environment, still kitted out in his familiar bowler hat and baggy trousers. And from here on the majority of the gags tend to be around such ridiculous juxtapositions, such as Charlie's nonchalant carving up of a boot for Thanksgiving dinner. This by the way is the biggest difference between Chaplin and his closest rival Buster Keaton. Keaton's gags involve meticulous planning and amuse you with their sheer cleverness. Chaplin's humour mostly comes from basic ideas, but the comedy is all in the way he plays them out. Chaplin's partnership with Keystone veteran Mack Swain is particularly effective. Swain looks faintly ridiculous with his burly build and babyish face, but he is never funny in his own right and thus holds up his corner of the comedy without ever upstaging the star.The other thing that sets Chaplin apart from his peers is his balancing of comedy with poignant drama, and The Gold Rush is a particularly sweet example of this. Again, we begin with an entrance, this time a more serious one for female lead Georgia Hale. Chaplin shows her coming out of a photographer's, cleverly framing her with some homely portraits down the left-hand side of the screen. Although it's not yet clear to us what part she will play in the story, this linking of her with something that stands out from all the logs and snow makes her stick in our minds. Chaplin's first meeting with her in the dance hall is masterwork of dramatic direction, with Charlie keeping himself an isolated figure at one side of the screen, but constantly pulling our attention to him with little gestures. And never before has the dramatic story in a Chaplin picture been so realistic. The ""ladies' man"" Jack (played by the little-known Malcolm Waite) looks and acts like a genuine bully, a far cry from the pompous buffoons Charlie was normally up against, and the whole situation with him and Georgia seems entirely credible. Georgia Hale's steady-paced acting focuses us on her emotions, as does that of Chaplin himself.Considering this was Chaplin's personal favourite – and it is indeed one of his best – it is odd to learn that the biggest enemy The Gold Rush was to have in later years was, erm, Charlie Chaplin. In 1943 the comic re-cut his movie to suit what he assumed to be ""modern tastes"". The result is a bizarre travesty. He replaces the intertitles with voice-over narration, which is far more distracting and superfluous than even the wordiest of title texts. Worse still he shortens or cuts out many of the scenes which develop that wonderfully tentative love story between Charlie and Georgia, dragging it down to the level of a crass and gratuitous subplot. Luckily for us, the modern DVD release includes the original version as an ""extra"". The original is the real deal and, as Chaplin hoped, stands the test of time. His 1940s botch-up does not."
braddugg,"Sep 17, 2014",10/10,"Sir Charlie Chaplin, wrote many poems on celluloid that were moving with a smile. And here is one of them, that is hilarious and equally good as his other great films.This indeed, is great Chaplin Film that has many moments of comedy and it's situational, believable and slapstick. Chaplin had great stories to tell and indeed he mostly told great stories only. Based on the Klondike Gold Rush of 1890's Chaplin wrote this and made a phenomenal film. Undoubtedly, this was one of the landmark films in terms of setting and cinematography. The climax scene in house, is a treat to watch and is worth the wait till the end of it. I just loved it. But my favorite scene would be the ""roll dance"" with his girl amidst many people.This film boasts of the heroism in the Tramp and at times makes us sympathetic with the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). If in one scene he is a super dancer, the next one is smart escapist. All along, this film has only one thing and that's Chaplin. Well, I must say he was greatly supported by the cast.The art direction is something that is always great in Chaplin films and here again, it is superb. The set on the top of a snow hill, the falling off of the house, or anything you take it, it's great considering it was in 1925, the film happened. The next best thing is costume design. Now, what we are watching is a 1942 version of the film that was re-edited as Chaplin wanted it to be more precise and focused on the Gold rush itself.There was a Gold Rush, that is rushing for Gold in the snow cold mountains of Alaska, so many Americans rushed there to find gold and indeed, a few found gold too. So this is a film that tells us that story in a way, only Chaplin could do. This is a great film and one the finest films that stood the test of time from 1920's till 2010's.Charlie Chaplin has given us so many remarkable and memorable films that this too stands right up there. A 5/5 for this Chaplin Film too."
jamesjustice-92,"Apr 13, 2022",10/10,"This is the movie Charlie wanted to be remembered by and I can totally see why: ""The gold rush"" has got everything a great movie has - superb script, outstanding direction, touching performances, excellent musical score and all that is done by Chaplin himself. The story revolves around Tramp (or according to the credits, a lone prospector) who, like many others in his time, went to Alaska to become a gold digger and get rich. But there, in the small town, he discovers much more than he ever intended to - love.It happens all the time in our lives; we spend most of it searching for gold in all the wrong places but find platinum instead. And like Charlie's character we can be lone sometimes but we are never lonely. Because of his personality he finds friends very easily and although they may be using him he would never stoop to their level and keep himself the way he is - always helping, always smiling even if he's hurt inside because that's what makes him whole, that's what makes him human. Charlie taught me many things in life and one of them was that no matter how many times you fall it's the time that you get up and start walking that counts.""The gold rush"" begins a line of new leading ladies for Chaplin, this time it is Georgia Hale - absolutely stunning actress whose character could've been just another girl who holds her head way too high and doesn't see anyone worth her attention but Georgia gave all her heart to the role and you can see a different person in her eyes as the movie progresses.Charlie's narration that he recorded for the movie's 1942 re-release gives it an especially personal touch and we hear that he can act not only with his eyes but with his voice also."
pauleskridge,"Dec 3, 2024",9/10,"Nine stars. If I had to pick one Chaplin film that epitomizes his work at
its best, this would be it. It has the slapstick, the goofy side-characters,
the poignant yearning for acceptance, and the bravura manic intensity that are
hallmarks of Chaplin's work. And it has those nuggets that everyone
recognizes. Even if they've never seen the film before. I watched it with my
teen-age son, over the long weekend. And he admitted to having seen parodies
(or homages, or rip-offs) of the shoe scene, the bear-in-the-cabin scene, and
the cabin on the cliff scene. And maybe some others. He's seen a bunch of
Chaplin's shorts over the years, And Modern Times. But he admitted that he
was expecting a much slower-moving story than what he got. The version with
Chaplin narrating the action rips along in only about 65 minutes, and doesn't
let up from the start.One of the things that really makes the comedy sing is
the desperate heartbreak that The Tramp feels for Georgia, the dance hall girl. Chaplin understood that comedy and pathos are two sides of our shared human
coin, anticipating Walt Disney's dictum of ""no laugh without a tear"". And the
best moments of the film are the ones that pull that lever. Chaplin made this
film when he was riding high, still solidly in the silent era. A decade later,
he would be bucking the trend by still making silent comedies (Modern Times!),
but here is a pinnacle work by one of cinema's great early masters, at the
peak of his craft. It think I've seen it four or fives times now.Everyone should watch it at least once. 3 December 2024."
Bored_Dragon,"Oct 16, 2018",6/10,"Screenplay, directing, leading role, narrator, music... all done by Chaplin himself. But as much as I admire his genius and legacy and as much as this movie is great, Chaplin's appearance is extremely irritating to me. With all due respect, I simply can not stand the guy.6/10"
jewelch,"Jan 31, 2021",9/10,"With some great theatrical, yet genuine performances, outstanding humor, and some outstanding editing, The Gold Rush manages to be one of the best films of Chaplin's career. Like all of his films, The Gold Rush is a great representation of both the harsh realities of life and the hope that comes along with that. It's a beautiful movie, and one that still stands the test of time almost a hundred years later. Yes I recommend It James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 1/31/2021"
TeddyJEG,"Nov 4, 2009",4/10,"Strangely, a plot summary of this silent comedy might sound terribly depressing. A lone prospector travels to the frozen Klondike in search of gold. He battles against the elements, and such severe starvation that he must eat his own shoe to stave off hunger. At a nearby dance hall, he faces constant cruelty from a woman he adores, her group of friends, and her bully of a boyfriend. He also faces life-threatening dangers from a homicidal miner, a ferocious black bear, and his own mad companion who nearly resorts to cannibalism. The film somehow manages to remain an extremely light-hearted comedy throughout all of these morbid events, because, in essence, Chaplin's films are live-action cartoons. Perhaps a more accurate statement would be: many cartoons are essentially hand-drawn imitations of Chaplin. The Gold Rush features Chaplin at his most cartoonish, in the most complimentary sense of the word."
NPG,"Sep 5, 1999",N/A,"The tramp never had it so good. Chaplin really made this film hilarious,wild, and most of all, creative. The falling cabin is still a masterpiece,eating a boot, and the ship scenes are even good. Seeing this will make you see what a comedy really is and inspires alot of today's comedies."
calyeager,"Mar 2, 2021",8/10,"Were people in the 1920's funnier than in the 2020's? Nearly 100 years later, The Gold Rush reminds the audience that ideas inspiring levity and tomfoolery have been always been around. This was my first Chaplin film but it's easy to see why The Gold Rush is still regarded a classic. The Criterion Collection version is easy to watch with super solid camerawork, great audio quality, and nicely balanced lighting. This film is exemplary as a silent film, not wasting time on reading for audiences unless it's absolutely necessary but still telling a whole story. I give The Gold Rush an 8/10."
TobinTelleran,"Feb 18, 2018",9/10,It is truly amazing that Chaplin is able to deliver such a remarkable performance and tell a great tale through acting and visuals alone.There are some truly great scenes where he brings all of his skill to light.At 135 mins I thought that this was going to be a slog but the pacing is perfect and the story is intriguing.Chaplin's best film in my opinion.
MartinOaks,"Sep 8, 2025",10/10,"This unique and dazzling work is a cinematic gem that, exactly 100 years after its release, continues to shine with the same intensity. It is a film that encapsulates the genius of Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin, not only as an actor but also as a director, screenwriter, and composer.Chaplin achieves a masterful balance between his trademark physical comedy and a profound human sensitivity. The story of Charlot, the little tramp who travels to Alaska in search of fortune during the Gold Rush, is filled with hilarious gags and memorable situations. From the iconic bun dance to the unforgettable scene of the boiled boot turned into a feast, whose perfect plasticity even awakens hunger, every comic moment is perfectly orchestrated from a magnificent stage.The film is a moving portrait of loneliness, hope, and perseverance. Despite adversity and the scorn of some, Charlot never loses his optimism or innocence, making him an endearing character with whom the viewer instantly identifies.Furthermore, ""The Gold Rush"" is also astonishing for its technical innovation. Chaplin, meticulous in every detail, used special effects and editing techniques that were advanced for their time, creating sequences that still amaze today with their ingenuity.""The Gold Rush"" is a complete cinematic experience, a testament to the power of silent film to convey complex emotions and profound stories. Chaplin gave us a timeless work that should be required viewing in schools, academies, high schools, colleges, and athenaeums around the world as an international artistic legacy."
jsinger90,"May 1, 2007",8/10,"Today I have recovered a classic one, after seeing the documentary ""Chaplin Today"" on its film of the 1925, and knowing peculiar things the running like for example the end different from the 25 the original version of and the definitive version of the decade of the 40, also mounted by the teacher Chaplin and where it put its voice to the personage ""The Lone Prospector"", and also to know since it has influenced in its east work film to the film director Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso.Before nothing to emphasize the facility to laugh itself, with the scene to cook its own boot, and when eats it with its companion of adventures, surely remembering the hungry that it was to pass in that another time of his life. To emphasize also fight of adventurer with few means (flat where it takes to writing in pencil the coordinates of a compass), an unconscious one of the high risks of its adventure (when it sees a congealed died poster of an expeditionary one, reacts with great surprise).A great film that says many things of the human nature, from the cruelty and deceit of at first platonic love, almost the culmination of a cannibal action, thanks to the loss of real conscience to do surely for a forced subconscious mind to fight to survive, but that is gained by the shouts of plea of the possible victim that makes wake up the mentally ill human conscience of the momentary one, and mainly the work in equipment and the fidelity of both partners, thanks to this commitment and fidelity that obtain therefore the objective fixed to the search of the mineral so valued."
BeneCumb,"May 23, 2025",8/10,"This film is more than a silent film-it's a profound reflection on the human condition wrapped in comedic genius. Set during the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin's Little Tramp navigates hunger, cold, and loneliness, all while seeking gold, companionship, and, ultimately, love. Beneath its slapstick exterior lies a touching meditation on human survival and yearning, delivered with visual poetry and heart.Inspired by real-life hardships-from images of Klondike prospectors to the tragic Donner Party-Chaplin crafted a world that is simultaneously bleak and whimsical. His commitment to authenticity is evident: an artificial mountain was built, and snowbound scenes were shot in the Sierra Nevada with over 600 extras. Yet despite these grand efforts, the film's charm lies in its simplicity. Iconic moments-like the dancing rolls or the cabin teetering on a cliff-remain etched in cinematic history.Chaplin's performance is magnetic. Without dialogue, he expresses a symphony of emotions, often blending comedy and tragedy in the same scene. The supporting cast, especially Georgia Hale, adds emotional depth, even if the romance feels slightly underdeveloped by today's standards.Although The Gold Rush might lack the emotional punch of City Lights or the social critique of Modern Times, its balance of humor, adventure, and quiet melancholy makes it a unique gem in Chaplin's filmography. Even those new to silent cinema are likely to be captivated by its universal storytelling.A masterpiece of emotional resonance and technical achievement, The Gold Rush remains a golden example of why Chaplin is still revered a century later."
Ahmad_pilehvar,"Jun 21, 2020",8/10,Of course this movie was on of the best movies of Mr Chaplin. he was a great actor and in this movie he show's us who pure love and believing on that could change your life. and the life have a lot of up and down all you do is never give up and always try to make life better for yourself. thanks to Mr Chaplin it was one of most beautiful 70minues of my life and I enjoyed to spend my time to watch this masterpiece.
briancham1994,"Mar 20, 2021",6/10,"I watched the 1942 version of this film with the voice acting and I must say it's a very clumsy experience to watch. The characters all seem to have the same voice and just express things that are very obvious or don't need to be repeated. On the other hand, the narration does sometimes clarify the action on the screen, which just emphasises how unclear it was originally. An example would be near the end when the ship's captain is informed that Charlie Chaplin's character is not a stowaway. If not for the narration, it would just seem like a strange conflict was instigated and then suddenly averted for no clear reason. This makes me doubt the skill of the visual storytelling here - while Charlie Chaplin is generally a master of using only props and expressions to communicate the situation, and this film is full of that skill, there are clearly lapses at times. Other than these misgivings, The Gold Rush has memorable characters, a solid storyline, passionate emotions and intense set pieces - the bear (which used a real bear in production) and the cliff being the stand-outs to me."
LunarPoise,"Jan 19, 2012",10/10,"Arguably Chaplin's most enduring work, The Gold Rush is choc full of visual gags that have become classics in their own right, screened devoid of context and imitated a thousand times over, but never surpassed. The Tramp goes off to the Gold Rush and grapples with bears, extreme winds and cold, hunger, and love for a dilettante woman. The contrast between the diminutive tramp and the two huge brutes he shares his cabin with is the constant sight conceit. It plays out wonderfully in the cliff-edge cabin scene. It enhances the boot-cooking scene and the hallucination of Tramp as chicken. The film also has heart that transcends the sentimentalism that preyed on the cinema of its times - the Tramp is made to work for his maiden's hand, and her humiliation of him on New Year's Eve is poignant and painful.Story, camera-work, editing, effects, acting and score (Neil Brand's current interpretation) all gel wonderfully in a celebration of cinema's power when every element clicks. Great in 1925, great in its restored version screening in 2012, and destined to be celebrated as long as humankind gather to see stories visually represented. In short, timeless genius."
EdgarST,"Apr 17, 2024",10/10,"Charles Chaplin may not be everybody's favorite comic of silent cinema: as for myself, sometimes I prefer Buster Keaton while there are times I feel more inclined to Harold Lloyd. But we cannot deny that neither made such a great film as this tale of love, greed, misfortune, and luck. Not even Chaplin topped himself! The film includes classic scenes and sequences, as the roll dance, the complete sequence in the cabin with Mack Swain (including Chaplin cooking his shoe or dressed as a chicken), the waltz scene... Chaplin was so fond of this work that he declared that this was the film for which he most wanted to be remembered. A true masterpiece."
bob the moo,"May 25, 2008",N/A,"Seeking his fortune, a lone prospector heads out to the Klondike to get gold. What he finds there at first is little more than snow and the very high chance of an early death. However having survived a cabin without any food, he makes his way into town where he finds that not all wealth comes in the form of money or commodities for sale.I have negative comments to make on this film but I'll hold back on them because they will hopefully not apply if you follow my advice. I recorded The Gold Rush off a movie channel doing a season of classic Chaplin because I felt I had not seen enough of his work to really be able to form an opinion. Unfortunately for me what I saw was not the original release of the film but rather the 1940's re-release  but I'll come back to this later because I'll try not to hold this against it because in its original form the film is a very pleasing and enjoyable comedy which has funny highs in among a plot that manages to be much more than just a collection of sketches.For my money it does not contain sufficient highs to make it consistent but in it we have some classic routines that most people will have seen (or been aware of) before seeing the film itself. Outside of these the material is consistently amusing if not hilarious and the total narrative arch (for indeed there is one) is reasonable enough as a story to provide a frame. So why do I have a problem with it then? It has many classic moments, plenty of laughs and all within a good delivery but yet watching it at times was grating.The reason for this was my misfortune to be watching the reissue and not the original. In the reissue (made in the time of talkies) all the dialogue cards have been removed and instead the film plays with a running narration provided by Chaplin himself. It sounds bad but this dos not do justice to hold annoying it is. If you have ever accidentally used the audio subtitles for blind viewers (where everything is described) then you'll know how bad it is. To put it another way bear in mind that for Blade Runner, the reissue stripped away the spoon-feeding narration in the same way as The Gold Rush added it! Overall then this is a really enjoyable Chaplin feature length film but I'm implore you to make sure that you get the original version and not the narrated reissue. The former deserves its praise but the reissue is a totally misjudged polish of something that was already perfect on its own and the addition of sound takes away so much while adding almost nothing."
n-racicot,"Sep 14, 2010",7/10,Gold Rush was my first silent film. i never thought i would have enjoyed having to read to know what was going on in a movie. The Gold Rush was a box office hit currently still being the 5th highest grossing silent film in cinema history. Certain points in the plot of the film confused me but the general idea was visible. The movie is about a man on a pursuit for wealth. He ends up discovering more than he was searching for after making a few friends along the way. Charlie Chaplin plays a very comical character that makes the movie easy to/fun to watch. the movie covers all of the human emotions and feelings. The intertwining paths of the characters sets the change of the mood often and sporatic. He is the guy who started a style that many followed over the years like the three stooges to current slap stick comedies.
robfollower,"Aug 9, 2020",9/10,"D: Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain, Tom Murray. Immortal Chaplin classic, pitting Little Tramp against Yukon, affections of dance-hall girl, whims of a burly prospector. Dance of the rolls, eating leather shoe, cabin tottering over cliff--all highlights of wonderful, timeless comedy. Chaplin reedited film in 1942; that version, with his narration and music, runs 72m."
CinemaSerf,"Apr 19, 2024",7/10,"Despite the fact that it's minus 10° high up on the snowy mountain pass, the ""Lone Prospector"" (Charlie Chaplin) bedecked in his ill-fitting suit and bowler hat is determined to go make his fortune. Luckily, starving and cold, he stumbles upon the log cabin of ""Larsen"" (Tom Murray) and getting warm and fed becomes the order of the day - even if it's owner isn't so keen on sharing his long solid fish. Enter ""Big Jim"" (Mack Swain) and the three engage in the start of the antics that keep this classic piece of cinema rolling along entertainingly. After loads of to-ing and fro-ing, near death experiences and a near-miss with a big black bear, our wanderer finds himself in town at the glamorously titled ""Monte Carlo"" dance hall where he takes a shine to the dancer ""Georgie"" (Georgia Hale) but sadly he is still broke! Meantime, ""Larsen"" turns out to be a wanted felon with designs on their amnesiac big pal's claim - and it falls to our lovestruck tramp to sort things out and maybe even get the gal too! The chilly setting works well, supporting the set-piece comedy that uses a tight ensemble cast to keep a story of perseverance, loyalty and romance ticking along with loads of activity, dancing, tripping and sliding about. Chaplin was a master at this - his facial expressions are just great and even when provoked by the unkindly townsfolk who think him a bit of a wimp, he retains his dignified, hat-tipping, demeanour. Sparing inter-titles keep us informed but we don't rally need them - it is all very self explanatory and good fun."
Zooha-47207,"Mar 9, 2024",3/10,"The Gold Rush, a 1925 silent film, receives a 3/10 from me due to its outdated style and the challenges it poses to modern audiences. Despite being a significant work in the history of cinema, its appeal to contemporary viewers is limited.Set in the silent film era, the movie relies entirely on visual storytelling and physical comedy, a style that was groundbreaking at the time but feels out of step with today's cinematic expectations. The absence of dialogue requires viewers to adjust their viewing habits significantly, which can be a challenge for those accustomed to the sound and dialogue of modern films.Furthermore, the pacing and storytelling techniques of The Gold Rush, typical of the 1920s, can feel slow and simplistic to current audiences. While the film does have historical importance and showcases the early creativity of cinema, it lacks the complexity and depth that many modern viewers seek in films today.In conclusion, while The Gold Rush is an iconic piece of early cinema and a testament to the innovation of its era, its silent, old-fashioned nature and the resulting limitations in storytelling make it more of a historical artifact than a compelling entertainment experience for today's audience, hence the 3/10 rating."
estebangonzalez10,"Apr 24, 2014",8/10,"""We must get food. One of us must brave that storm.""The film that Chaplin wanted to be remembered for, The Gold Rush, is his most ambitious and adventurous one. Chaplin takes center stage once again and takes us to the snowy mountains of Alaska. Under extremely harsh conditions the tramp struggles to survive, but he always faces life with his innocent naivety and cheerfulness. The Gold Rush is a simple rags to riches story, but somehow the tramp doesn't let his social condition define who he is. He remains the same quirky character no matter the circumstances he faces. In the midst of all the hilarious moments, Chaplin always manages to send an uplifting message to his audience. He reminds us that no matter how difficult the circumstances we are going through are, if we continue to move forward something good is going to come out of it. The Gold Rush might not be his most critically acclaimed film, but it does have some of his most memorable scenes. Without ever having seen this movie I had already seen several clips like the scene where the tramp is preparing a roasted shoe or the scene in which his friend is starving so much that he imagines the tramp as a chicken and chases him. The scenes that take place in the cabin are all hilarious and have inspired many famous cartoon scenes as well. However his most famous and beloved scene involved the dancing rolls which was played over and over again in the theaters were it was played. Perhaps Chaplin is remembered for his work in Modern Times or City Lights, but the scenes in The Gold Rush have passed the test of time and captivated audiences around the world. The good thing about silent films is that they are universally accepted because actions don't need translations.The Gold Rush takes place in gorgeous Alaska during 1898 as thousands of prospectors faced the harsh conditions in order to find gold and become millionaires. The tramp, who is known in this film as the lone prospector (Charles Chaplin), also heads to Alaska on his own dreaming of becoming wealthy man. After a severe storm hits his area, the tramp locates a small cabin and finds refugee there. But the cabin isn't abandoned, a thief known as Black Larsen (Tom Murray) is hiding there. Before Black Larsen can kick him out of the cabin another large prospector arrives. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) uses his size to intimidate Black Larsen and convinces him to allow the three men to stay there until the storm passes. As the days pass the men begin to starve so they decide one of them must face the storm and bring back food. The unlucky fellow isn't the tramp this time as Black Larsen is the chosen one. After a few days the storm passes and the lone prospector decides to head to the nearest gold-rush community where he falls in love with a saloon girl known as Georgia (Georgia Hale) and tries to win her heart.The best moments of The Gold Rush involve the lone prospector's adventures in the cabin and his misunderstandings with the other large prospectors. The love story however was the weakest link as the girl here really doesn't do anything to deserve the tramp's love. She isn't really likable so I can see how critics at the time were unsatisfied by the ending of this film. The Gold Rush could've been his most critically acclaimed film if it had an ending like City Lights. I think that film gets more recognition because Chaplin learned his lesson and ended that film on a perfect note. There is no discussion however that most of the famous Chaplin scenes come from The Gold Rush. This was Chaplin's longest and most produced film at the time and he succeeds again in blending slapstick with pathos effortlessly. The Gold Rush is a fun adventure with several highlights, but I think a shorter running time for silent films works better. Chaplin still never ceases to lose his charm and his character of the tramp never gets old. I also love the score in all his films, they are just inspiring and uplifting. After watching his third feature film, I must agree that his films are timeless and universal."
dreamfulmehedi,"Mar 23, 2018",9/10,One of the best funny movies I've seen so far. Charlie just nails it.
malvernp,"May 29, 2023",10/10,"As most of Charlie Chaplin's fans now know, he authorized the release of two versions of The Gold Rush (TGR): the original silent one running 82 minutes-----and a 1942 revised and considerably re-edited one minus title cards, with added music and Chaplin's own narration running 72 minutes. Most critics believe the revised version to be inferior to its silent predecessor.What some of those fans may not know is that there were three different actresses involved in playing the dance-hall lovely who charmed The Little Prospector in Chaplin's classic tale. The first, Edna Purviance (born in 1895), was Chaplin's initial leading lady in many of his earlier films and was the one he first considered to play the part. However, when Chaplin finally began to seriously work on the project, Purviance was approaching the age of 30 and he ultimately considered her to be too old for the role.Next up was a young lady named Lita Grey (born in 1908). Chaplin first met Grey when she was just six years old and he was age 25. They became re-acquainted when she reached the age of 12, and he then cast her to play an adult-like part as the ""flirty angel"" in The Kid (1921). Apparently Grey's emerging adolescence stimulated Chaplin to see her as a young woman. In any event, when Purviance dropped out of the picture, Chaplin projected Grey------then only an early teenager-----to be someone capable of playing the leading part of the dance-hall girl who captures his heart. The TGR company moved from Hollywood to its remote winter location site of Truckee, CA and began shooting exteriors and a few scenes with Grey. Then Life began to imitate Art. Chaplin soon developed a romantic relationship with the 15 year old girl, which resulted in her becoming pregnant. Obviously Grey could not continue with her part in TGR. Chaplin and Grey entered into a hasty wedding (his second and her first) in Mexico, and her filmed scenes in TGR were scrapped. Shortly thereafter, Grey had her first child with Chaplin (Charles Chaplin, Jr.) soon followed by a second son (Sydney Earl Chaplin). The marriage was unsuccessful and three years later, it was followed by an acrimonious divorce. Many years of domestic conflict were to continue for Chaplin and Grey.Who was now to play the leading lady part in TGR? Chaplin was impressed by the performance of Georgia Hale (born in 1906) in Josef Von Sternberg's first Hollywood film, The Salvation Hunters (1925), and she was quickly lined up for the role. Perhaps somewhat less appealing than Grey but just as charming, Hale and Chaplin hit it off and worked successfully during the filming of TGR. In fact, they, too, began a romantic alliance during the shoot-----but it was not complicated by an unwanted pregnancy. Hale and Chaplin continued their personal involvement with each other on and off for several years thereafter. She never appeared in another film with Chaplin.The miracle of TGR is that none of the off-screen drama that plagued Chaplin at this time emerges in the finished film. His genius managed to bring all of its different elements together undiminished by the intimate turmoil and distractions thar swirled around the production. It seems as fresh and enjoyable today as it did when released almost 100 years ago. TGR is one of the greatest films ever made and possibly Chaplin's finest creation. It is an enduring tribute to Chaplin's extraordinary creativity that he was able to overcome his personal adversity and give us a film for the ages."
StevePulaski,"Feb 18, 2013",9/10,"NOTE: The version of Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush that is being reviewed is the full-length, uncut ninety-six minute version released in 1925, as opposed to the seventy minute cut released in 1942 with updated narration, music, and several story cuts.Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush opens with the mesmerizing shot of hundreds of people walking along the mercilessly snowy Chilkoot Pass in search of gold, rumored to be existing by the limitless amount in California. We then cut to our lead character, nicknamed ""The Lone Prospector,"" (or ""The Tramp"") played by Chaplin himself, who is dapper, determined, but lonely as he attempts to hike towards riches in California from his homestate of Alaska. Along the way, trouble ensues from fellow gold-seekers, love blossoms with a local saloon girl (Georgia Hale), who may not feel as strongly as the prospector does, and many classic silent-era magic is created.Chaplin, who directed, wrote, produced, edited, and starred in this film said this would be his opus; the film he wanted to be remembered for and it would appear he got his wish. This is one of the quintessential Chaplin films, and it also serves as the first one I've ever seen. There is a delicate approach to the material, and even at the original ninety-six minutes, it's pretty short considering all the macro-material that was crammed into this film. Love, tragedy, persistency, determination, and finally, something resembling success.One of the things I've heard from Chaplin enthusiasts is that it's difficult to analyze his films as a whole; ""you're best bet is to take the funny scenes and go into what makes them funny"" said one of my closest friends, so I think I'll do that. Take for example, the iconic scene where Chaplin and his pal feast on his own shoe and laces. The scene was so spontaneous, unexpected, and downright absurd that it seemed the only proper thing to do was laugh at it all. Another scene would be the dance of the dinner rolls, where Chaplin takes two of his forks, stabs two dinner rolls, and allows them to sashay on the table at his control. It's the act and the approach that make these scenes funny. The question is simply 'why?' and if there were ever to be two perfect examples of functioning slapstick, these two would be it, not just for their absurdity, but their ability to stand alone as two great comic scenes.It's also apparent that this is a film that can merge slapstick and sentimentality to a functioning, non-manipulative formula that doesn't come crashing down on the audience. There's genuine emotion in this story; true feelings that come out and realism when the prospector realizes his love may be doomed, which is even sadder than not striking any gold. The way this part of the story is handled is sublime and commendable, fore it knows when to abandon slapstick in favor of a more serious approach.And who can forget the end, where the prospector and Big Jim, a fellow gold-seeker (Mack Swain) are trapped in the isolated cabin amidst high winds and merciless blizzard conditions that are sending the shack right off a cliff. This is one of the several scenes of the silent era in cinema that should be treasured and awed for its terrific effects work and brilliant execution. To be fair, the whole film should as well. It holds up, in its eighty-eight year, where all the jokes are still relevant, the only thing that has become dated is the style, and Chaplin's tour-de-force performance still shines if anything. How many films made today can you say that about in one hundred years? Starring: Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain, and Georgia Hale. Directed by: Charlie Chaplin."

desacafrancisco,"Nov 1, 2023",10/10,"The Gold Rush is a film that showcases Chaplin's genius as a comedian, storyteller, and filmmaker. It tells the story of the Little Tramp, a hapless prospector who goes to Alaska in search of gold and finds love, adventure, and trouble along the way. The film is full of hilarious and memorable scenes, such as the shoe for dinner, the dancing rolls, and the cabin on the edge of a cliff. The film also has a heartwarming romance between the Tramp and a beautiful saloon girl, played by Georgia Hale. The film is a masterpiece of visual comedy, with Chaplin using his body language, facial expressions, and props to create laughter and emotion. The film is also a technical marvel, with impressive sets, effects, and cinematography. The film is one of Chaplin's best works, and one of the greatest comedies of all time.The Gold Rush is a film that I love and admire. It is a film that makes me laugh, cry, and smile. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating."
marmar-69780,"Feb 5, 2020",9/10,"It is a shame how before even in early days of cinema comedys were far funnier then todays,and the gold rush is defienetly one of most famous and funniest ones,lets just say something chaplin was a brilliant mind behind camera i mean how many people can direct,write,star and compose for their films todays that is impossible to do,but chaplin was one of a kind and one most influental masters of his work,even if this film is silent and black and white it is still relavent today and it hasnt aged a bit,jokes are funny and use of comedic situations is in a right timing,the gold rush is one of earliest masterpieces of cinema made by one of greatest charlie chaplin"
MJB784,"May 24, 2018",9/10,"This is my choice for the best silent comedy! It is surprising that Chaplin would re-edit this in the 40s with voice over narration and removal or the intertitles and terrific ending. I keep alternating on my favorite Chaplin since Modern Times and City Lights are classics, too, but this seems like a win-win since it's stylistically groundbreaking, hilarious and with heart. The other two have that as well, but the jokes here are more relevant to the story and it ends with everything going Chaplin's way with friendship, romance and, of course, gold."
jackfull,"Oct 1, 2018",10/10,"Living in an age where the norm in cinema is heavy action, verbal comedy, and almost all the visuals are done with special effects, Charlie Chaplin's Gold Rush is something I watched out of boredom and did not expect to be as good as it is. It is one of the few films out there that received a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was a film released in 1925, originally silent, then later music and a voice over was added and it was re released in 1942. It does not matter which version you watch, although I suggest that if you want a more immersive experience, the 1942 version is the way to go. In its original release alone, it pulled $1 million dollars into United Artists, and $2 million to Chaplin. This was in 1926!
Getting into the nitty-gritty of this film, this is some of Chaplin's best work in my opinion. Although the story is basic and scenes are easily predictable, it is still a great laugh to watch. This film has some great examples of how Chaplin liked to direct and make his films.He takes a basic scenario where we as the viewer think we know exactly what will happen. ""Oh his pants are falling so he'll take that rope he eyed on the table and tie it around his waist."" This is the first step of reality. Then in typical Chaplin fashion, he flip reality on us. ""He's used the rope to hold up his pants, but its the leash to a dog!"" That's how most if not all of Chaplin's jokes work. Camera angle also plays into effect here. We only see the rope on the table Chaplin wants to use. But what we can't see from this angle is the dog laying on the floor, tied to the rope. This how the majority of the jokes play out in this movie and although it is a bit old school to do it this way, it makes the movie great!
The characters and story in this film are also fantastic! You have the prospector (Charlie Chaplin), the disposable bad guy(Tom Murray), the friend(Mack Swain), the love interest(Georgia Hale), and the cocky ladies man(Malcom Waite). Like I said before, the story is at its root pretty basic,(boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back) but its the jokes and how the story is played out that makes this so enjoyable. 
Closing up, this film is not only a great work of Chaplin, but of cinema. Chaplin some years later had said that this was the film he wanted to be remembered for. The filming is good, the characters, the visuals, the story. Its all a hilarious classic adventure. Definitely watch this if you have time, it will be time well spent."
richard.morton,"Jun 22, 2000",9/10,"I recently saw this movie with a live orchestra, and although the print itself was not the best, the experience was wonderful. Kudos to the orchestra for adding that extra dimension (The Asylum Street Spankers), but the true test of a great film is how fresh the central element remains. As I mentioned, the print was faded and scratched, the effects were primitive, some of the acting of the minor characters was overdrawn, but the character of the tramp, and the performance of Chaplin is as fresh, funny, moving, and surprising as if it were done yesterday. I take that back. I don't think there's an actor today capable of the perfectly created and executed performance of Charley Chaplin. I just hope there's a print out there which is in good shape and will be preserved forever."
lagudafuad,"Nov 29, 2012",7/10,"The Gold Rush is known as the movie that Charlie Chaplin said he will love to be known for; Gold Rush is funny and exciting to watch. The script and the screenplay are just as creative as they come, which was all know they come Charlie Chaplin style, making you laugh all the way. My favorite scene in this movie is where the house was hanging on a cliff, with the Lone Prospector and Big Jim trapped inside. The movie boasts of such amazing screenplay, especially that specific scene.Chaplin's movies have received numerous recognitions for their work and appeal, this movie is no exception it got an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Recording, although it is a silent film. In 1942, Chaplin re-released the movie and in this new version, he added a musical score and a narration which he recorded himself, the original version was a silent film done in 1925.The movie's plot is about a character named The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) whose desire to venture into Alaska to look for gold led him down a path of adventure where he discovered gold and fell in love. In his adventure he met Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen and during a storm all three were trapped in a cabin.While they were tapped in the cabin, they ran out of food and Larsen went out to go search for some, while Big Jim almost ate the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin), as Larsen wasn't back in time and he Big Jim was hungry. The movie then carried on, at the end of the storm, Big Jim unfortunately loses his memory as he battled with Larsen at one point while the Lone Prospector went into town and fell in love with a girl he met at a saloon named Georgia.Although Gold Rush is fun and a nice movie to see, but it is not as great as City Lights which was done six years after. Gold Rush was a box office success gaining over 4 million dollars. The movie made over four times its production cost and it is featured in the AFI's top 100 movies of 100 years (10th Anniversary Edition), there it is rated 58 and it is rated the 25th funniest movies in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs.Charlie Chaplin has been a wonderful actor, director, writer and producer in the many movies that he has done; this is just as much a classic as the others. Gold Rush is fun to watch and you will find yourself laughing your way through.www.lagsreviews.com"
grantss,"Oct 31, 2014",8/10,"Classic Charlie Chaplin movie. Complete with the usual incredibly creative visual comedy and romantic angle. Very funny. Contains some of Chaplin's most memorable and iconic scenes: the stewed boot, the dancing bread rolls (revived for a modern audience by Johnny Depp in Benny and Joon), the cabin on the edge of a cliff (which must have inspired scores of cartoon scenes).Incredibly innovative cinematography for 1925. The chicken illusion scene must have been very original and technologically advanced for its time.One disappointment, however. I saw the 1942 revised version of the movie, wherein Chaplin replaced the written dialogue with narration and added a more in-sync score. No issues with the score, but the narration spoils the movie, to an extent. The great thing about silent movies is figuring out the jokes and plot just by the visual medium. With the narration, it feels like you are spoon-fed the jokes and plot, and makes the whole movie feel dumbed-down.I haven't seen the 1925 version but I imagine I would enjoy that more."
corner-2,"Oct 10, 2006",9/10,"This was the first Chaplin film I ever saw shown in in a movie theater in its original silent version with a live pianist, just the way it was meant to be seen. It was an amazing, unforgettable experience.When I bought a video of the film, I didn't realize that it was the video of the 1932 version with the commentary Chaplin added years later. It also had a music track and sound effects, and I urge everyone to avoid it or at least turn off the volume when you watch it. He destroys his own masterpiece with unnecessary and distracting remarks.If you are buying or renting the film, please choose the 1925 original. You won't regret it."
mobynico,"Sep 21, 2025",9/10,"A hundred years searching for gold... and in the end, all we got was a boiled boot and a couple of bread rolls doing a tap dance. The Gold Rush still shines a century later, though perhaps that's only because celluloid ages better than second-hand footwear. Chaplin, master of turning misery into comedy, makes loneliness and despair look like a variety show; no one before him had managed to make hunger quite so entertaining.A masterpiece, some say; just a gag with boots and rolls, others reply. Either way, Chaplin proves that if you don't strike gold in the mountains, you can always find it in the audience's laughter... or at least in the ticket price."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Apr 20, 2014",8/10,"A lone prospector(Chaplin, shy and kind, giving the best of all the great physical performances of anyone in this; he also wrote the narration he provides for the version I watched(of this otherwise silent film, and one can see how it worked purely from its visual storytelling), which is 68 minutes long, or 69 if you count the ending credits) goes to Klondike on the titular gold rush(albeit ironically, this is more of a backdrop), meeting new friends, enemies... and perhaps love?This is another slapstick gem. The timing, planning and execution are all spot-on, with most scenes featuring material building to a climax. A lot of the humor comes from the predicament of being trapped in a cabin with little to no food, as well as the sweet(simple, yes, but also enjoyable) romance. There is a real optimism about humanity here, and it is utterly infectious. The universal and age-old themes brought up keep it relevant after nearly 90 years.All this while the thin line between comedy and tragedy grows ever slimmer, nearly disappearing at points. Pacing and score keep certain bits from being terrifying, and make them comical instead. From a technical standpoint, this is well-done. Production values are fairly high, with FX that, while not seamless, have aged well.There is some violence and other disturbing content in this, though the majority of it is funny - not at the expense of those it happens to, we're laughing with, not at, them. I recommend this to anyone who isn't put off by the age, concept or monochromatic nature of this. 8/10"

COMEDYComedy legend Charlie Chaplin as ""The Little Tramp"" by chance him befriending gold rush explorer, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), which this plot device is nothing more than a backdrop to many of his comedy nuance routines, including being so hungry that he ends up 'eating his own shoe', 'the balancing of a cabin house' and 'the dancing dinner rolls'. And of course, theirs also a leading lady Georgia (Georgia Hale) to whom the little tramp falls and cares for.

Behdinderakhshan,"Mar 20, 2020",8/10,"Great Master Chaplin unlike his other masterpieces does something extra magnificent in this movie
First He shows the heat of real love in the middle of coldness and thunder, while most of the people seek for gold somewhere in nowhere, or even at some points viciously killing and hunting each other.
Here, deep in the blizzard comes our little fellow as an unprofessional prospector, perhaps tired of living in extreme poverty in the cruel concrete Jungle, with not so much hope to find anything at all; he of course prefers an adventures life.His old little jokes combined with some strong psychological matters such as cannibalism, lust, hate and love, creates such a distinctive masterpiece than his other movies.
Also the form of love in the movie which is shaped after its prefct Structure truly turns out to be as real as love itself, unlike his modern times which a robatic love and city lights which is love out pity at first.
I should say a clean and pure love has been depicted in the movie and maybe a true friendship also with big Jim.(With all respect may his soul rest in peace)"
JaydoDre,"Dec 27, 2014",7/10,"Note: Gold Rush comes in two versions. One is a traditional silent film, and the 1946 version is a mix between a silent movie and a talkie. In that one, characters are not talking but there is a narrator talking instead of there being title cards.There was a time, long ago, when slapstick was still smart. This Charlie Chaplin movie is an example from that era. Gold Rush is genuinely funny, despite the comedy being based on physical slapstick. There are no penis jokes or poop jokes needed to make this movie funny, unlike the modern ""comedies"". Although most of the comedy comes from Charlie Chaplin's physical hijinks, the commentary of the narrator can be quite witty as well. You will probably not be laughing loudly, but Gold Rush is a charming film worth plenty of smiles.The story is about the Tramp in Alaska during the gold rush era. I was surprised that some of the comedy was quite dark. Although the movie is entertaining overall, it did get a little tedious in the middle. The performances are not so captivating, and the humour is not so pronounceed as to keep you entertained the whole time. Also, the ending seems to be an afterthought. It feels rushed, like the story skips about 10 minutes worth of story that should have explained what happened to some of the characters.Behind the slapstick are themes of loneliness, resilience, fate, and survival. Comedy, sometimes very silly, is intersected with scenes of death, hardships, friendship, and celebration. This is quite a rollercoaster ride. By the end of the film, I was a bit surprised by the happy ending given to the main characters. If you follow the harsh reality shown throughout the film, you should end up with an equally realistic ending. But of course, this is still a comedy.The Gold Rush is also a visually interesting film. There are some special effects done using miniatures and a technique whereby the characters from one film are pasted over the background of another film. The shots of mock up models are interchanged with the close-up shots of the real thing, like for example there is a live bear involved but during certain scenes it becomes a dude in a costume. The effects look fake, but nonetheless interesting, and very advanced for the time. The cold landscape is hash, shown in high contrast. The set design for the town is very cozy and atmospheric.The Gold Rush didn't leave me with some special feeling, but it is definitely a gem and an excellent example of its genre."
Elizabeth-328,"Feb 17, 2000",8/10,"Even if you've never seen ""The Gold Rush"" in it's entirety, everyone has seen at least some famous parts.  These include the house teetering on the edge of the mountain, with Chaplin rocking back and forth, the tramp eating his shoe, because he's so hungry, and of course, the dancing rolls. Naturally, these are some of the funniest parts.  But there are also some really brilliant scenes in ""The Gold Rush"".  I recommend this to any Charlie Chaplin fan, or anyone who just wants to see a romantic comedy that will leave you with a smile on your face.Rating: 9 out of 10"

Horror-yo,"Jun 10, 2016",8/10,"Another classic Chaplin. As usual, and interestingly, although the story and plot are finely coherent, it could be said this film represents more a cluster of morals with each part conveying a particular sense and meaning, rather than how films classically supply one big singular morality at the end. Chaplin's films, though again certainly coherent and finely constructed, have that quality reminiscent of sketches; separate parts that work together as an ensemble; which only works in generating more entertainment for the viewer as he's given a wider palette of thought, visuals and humor. In this one Chaplin showcases his unique ability to make a scene out of nothing, create value out of very little going on, and if ever you'd find it unfunny it is at very least certainly very creative. I'd imagine everybody would laugh wholeheartedly at least once during this. Finally, as always with Chaplin, ultimately this is a tale of humanity, and one that highlights the endearing fact of the 'little guy', the oddball; so unlikely to succeed or fit in anywhere, who yet manages a whole lot more than any of that."

mohit_sinsniwal,"May 25, 2019",9/10,"The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.Charlie and Big Jim are left alone and without food when Larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene), and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. There is, of course, the boot eating scene, memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness, but also because while making the film, Chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Another thing that was really well done was the special effects. I am still amazed every time I watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing Charlie hanging from the door of the cabin, which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. Also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene, the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film Shine, with Geoffrey Rush.There is also a very noteworthy love element of The Gold Rush, a part of the story that Chaplin generally has much success with in his films. Charlie's amorous interests in Georgia, a dance hall girl, leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls, probably the most famous scene in the film, which was also performed very well by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon. Charlie's relationship with Georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes, when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. Chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies, and The Gold Rush is one of the best of his full length features. A must see for any Chaplin fan, but The Gold Rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch."
andreslo2000,"Apr 27, 2000",9/10,"One of the unforgettable film by great genius Charles Chaplin. His situation comedy is unique and I think nobody can ever reach him. Just think about scene where he was eating his own shoes. Shoe nail-delicious bone full of meat, shoe laces-tasteful Italian spaghetti, and the bottom-wonderful rare baked steak. But that's not enough for Charley. He's not satisfied with ""his stomach full"". He needs to dance a folk dance with forks and bread. Even this film would contain only this scene it would be more than enough to remember it together with ""our Charlotte""."
PCC0921,"Jun 4, 2021",9/10,"It's all about the pioneers. Charlie Chaplin had already been a seasoned veteran by the time he got to this film and it was only 1925. Motion Pictures were only 30 years old by this point in time. His body of work had already filled up a decade before this (and that isn't including any theater work he did before the films) and he was well on his way as being a film pioneer, visionary and an icon.None of this is more evident than in this film, because you see him accomplish acts and scenes that were repeated and copied by everyone who came after him. The Gold Rush (1925), is probably his most famous film (or at least the most popular, mostly because of its wide release in the cheap home video market over the last 40 years. (It is considered public domain) and that is probably what Charlie would have wanted.Charlie gets involved with the Gold Rush of 1848 and as you might expect it, he runs into some bad guys and eventually gets involved with a love interest, all, during crazy snow storms and chaos in the Yukon. He manages to deal with these pressures on his preordained, slap-stick, kind-of-a-life, by dealing with it, like he always does.Seeing him deliver some of his acrobatic stunts is amazing to see. He also manages to dish out the laughs and it is a treasure to see. He does things that would never be attempted today, mostly because of sensitive actors and paranoid, over-insured production companies. It makes you feel comfortable knowing that even though his safety was in jeopardy, the trade-off is, seeing a master-craftsman at work. See the Gold Rush (1925). It is so important.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
iquine,"Feb 3, 2021",6/10,(Flash Review)I must just like Buster Keaton more than Chaplin as this didn't wow me and I'm left longing for viewing more of Keaton's spectacular moments. This is a fine film and has Chaplin's famous potatoes with fork routine and then a very clever house on the edge of a snowy mountain ledge. But the 45 minutes before that were ho-hum. A couple light smirks and moments of trying to give his character some emotional depth.
Alfred-5,"Nov 22, 1998",9/10,"This is actually one silent movie that I actually got into. Seeing Chaplin waddle around with a bear reared up behind him is funny, but seeing him dig into a boiled shoe is even better.

Nazi_Fighter_David,"Aug 9, 2005",10/10,"If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinema's truly international epochit is Charles Chaplin's indomitable tramp The Little Fellow, as millions came to call him, was at once tatty and debonair, brow-beaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was, without question, the best-loved international star in all of film historyHis coat was too small, his pants too large, his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplin's tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as ""The Kid,"" and ""The Gold Rush.""""The Gold Rush"" is superb It deals with Charlie's adventures to win the affection of a local dance-hall girl, and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than heThe most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplin's exquisite grace, turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast: he carves it carefully, smacks his lips in anticipation, and then eats it with gusto and appreciation, sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti"

Good reminder.Last but not least, Chaplin's body language is stunning, a love every expression, every emotion represented, the way he uses all of his body to communicate is so powerful and beautiful to see."
Leofwine_draca,"Oct 26, 2025",6/10,"THE GOLD RUSH is a pretty decent feature-length vehicle for The Tramp, although I didn't find it as good as later fare such as CITY LIGHTS or (especially) MODERN TIMES. There's a little less comedy here, a little less of the genuinely funny, and it does occasionally drag, although for the most part it's worthwhile. The snowy locales add a change of backdrop for the slapstick antics, and the best of the material is in the snowbound cabin with the three characters at loggerheads; the latter part with the romance tails off a little, although it's always watchable."
Nick-leonardi,"May 16, 2013",8/10,"1925's biggest hit, ""The Gold Rush"" is also one of the greatest, most career-defining moments for Charlie Chaplin, the silent-era comic legend. Receiving a great commercial success, the film now is remembered as one of the highest pinnacles of the twenties and one of the great comedies of all time. The film has an irresistible and timeless charm, and even though there are better chapters in Chaplin's career, ""The Gold Rush"" is still one of the great films of our time.A tramp (Chaplin) travels to Alaska striving to take part in the gold Rush at the turn of the century. Lost in the wilderness, he finds a cabin in which he must cohabit with other two, stronger men, all of three of them facing the problem of hunger and isolation. Eventually, the tramp is able to reach a town, in which he meets and falls in love with Georgia, a young party girl.On one side of things, ""The Gold Rush"" is another Chaplin Romance film, with Georgia Hale, an intimate acquaintance of Chaplin, playing the role of Georgia. On the other hand, it's a contextualized slapstick comedy that doesn't bite like a satire, rather it makes you chuckle for its exuberance and lightheartedness. The film for which, the actor and director wanted to be remembered for. Apart from the 1925 version, there's also a 1942 version with added commentary, additional music, and a different ending."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Apr 16, 2018",7/10,"'The Gold Rush (1925)' does very much feel like a film of two halves, though these differing segments do converge and realign somewhat towards its final movement. It's the fact that the more romantic aspects are essentially less interesting and exciting than the other more visually arresting and comically enchanting moments that prevents the piece from ascending past Chaplin's other most famous efforts. Yet the picture, of which I viewed a restored version that essentially recreates the initial 1925 release, has aged remarkably well and is as charming as you'd expect, managing to maintain a clear and consistent level of visual storytelling and some superb set-pieces that are as amusing as they are impressive. It's just a shame that the flick's final note is actually a secretly, and most likely unwittingly, downbeat one. 7/10"
b-kelly13,"Sep 9, 2010",8/10,"""The Gold Rush"" has very realistic effects for being filmed in 1925. For instance even though this movie was filmed on Hollywood sets, it really looked as if all the characters were actually in the mountains of Alaska. The cabin, the clothing, the town, everything really helped to set the mood that they were actually there. The effect when the house is hanging off the mountain actually seemed real! Whenever there was too much weight on the side of the house which was over the cliff, the house would actually tip, with all of the items inside it sliding. This seems very good effects for the '20s. I also enjoyed the effects when Charlie Chaplin's character faded in and out from being a chicken, to the tramp.The comedy also seemed genius for the time. Many of the humorous parts that happened throughout the movie, you still see in movies now. Even though there is no dialogue, you really get what is happening. For example, when Charlie's character completely trashes the apartment because he is so excited that Georgia has agreed to come to dinner, and then Georgia returns because she has forgotten her gloves, and the tramp is humiliated. This similar scene was in the movie ""Just Friends"" with Ryan Reynolds. Also the scene where the tramp is dancing with Georgia and his pants will not stay up, and he accidentally ties the dog leash around his waist; you could definitely see where that would be in any sort of modern day comedy. What a great movie for being almost 90 years old!"
Locut0s,"Mar 5, 2010",9/10,"Classic Chaplin film, widely considered amongst his best. Sadly I saw a 1940s reissue of the film with narration by Chaplin over-top of the original silent film. The narration is not needed at all and in fact reduces ones enjoyment of this classic, Chaplin's acting is really all you need to ""get"" the story here, get the original if you can. So what can one say about the film? Well it's cute, its charming, warm hearted and clearly influenced film making and TV in many ways in years to come. Being a Chaplin film don't expect anything deep here, you're basically watching a heart warming slapstick comedy but one in which the acting and ""miming"" is just pitch perfect. It reminds me a lot of the Bugs Bunny and Road Runner cartoons of the 40s and 50s and clearly the slapstick of this era owns much to this film and others of the period. Some classic examples being the house teetering on the edge of a cliff, the character chase where the chaser becomes the chasee and or morphs into something else, the hungry man envisioning his partner as types of food, etc etc... This is of course the film with the classic bread roll dancing scene and I tell you too this very day it's still one of the most brilliant pieces of comedic miming I've ever seen. Chaplin is a genius at using his whole body to mime out scenes. There's an early example where he's supposed to be blown away by a heavy wind and it's clear that there's nothing more than a fan on set but by god does Chaplin do a picture perfect cartoonish mime of being blown away in the wind. Again though a reminder, get the original non narrated version."

The prospector meets a dance hall girl named Georgia and falls in love. Vowing to return a millionaire, he sets off with Jim to find the cabin where a gold deposit is near.From the Charlie Chaplin films I have seen over the years, I think this was his weaker one. Chaplin was an extraordinarily talented savant of films. He wrote, directed, acted, edited, produced, and wrote the music in most of his films. I don't know anyone else who was as versatile from film history. Plenty directed and starred in their own film, but that's the extent. Nobody else did everything and certainly not to the degree Chaplin did throughout his career.Would I recommend it? I don't think it's a must-watch. However, it's one of the earliest full-feature films and a cinematic experience. Silent films are not watched much anymore, but there is something that transcends time: acting. There is no sound, so everything is about the acting. Acting out things like comedy with no spoken words while still making your audience laugh is a daunting task. Chaplin was the master with his legendary miming skills, body language, and facial expressions."
DLochner,"Mar 8, 2024",7/10,"Charlie Chaplin improvised differently in this film - between slapstick and mortal danger in the mountains. 70,000m of film was shot, of which only 2000m was used. It clearly shows how much work Chaplin put into the film. In addition to the many jokes, it is also a criticism of society, which apparently is only interested in material things like gold. This criticism also brought the film a moderate success. As usual with Chaplin, people wanted to laugh.While Chaplin's trademark humor is undoubtedly charming, its combination with serious themes such as poverty and hunger can sometimes be perceived as incongruent. This may result in the film's message not being conveyed as strongly and clearly as it might have been if Chaplin had focused exclusively on one of these aspects.All in all, still worth seeing today. Whether it is Charlie Chaplin's best film remains to be seen."
t-d-t-m82,"Nov 13, 2023",10/10,Charlie Chaplin had so many great sketches of comedic gags. He was a pioneering screenplay comedian.Acting is superb. It's all on the visuals as obviously there's no audio apart from the fabulous piano score.It's an emotive story about prospectors set in the good ol' USA at a time when the man who obtained gold got rich and was the envy of his peers.Sadly people still think that today and equity and capitalism are the envy now when there's much more to life. Do people learn?I love the desperation of the actors and the infighting. The slapstick is just excellent. The way Chaplin provokes the audience for gags and laughs is divine. A sensational talent.A classic movie. Please watch. So many acting lessons on show.
elect_michael,"Jan 1, 2023",8/10,"8.0 of 10 stars. Most respected Film Historians would say that Charlie Chaplin Directed 15-20 masterpieces during his career, and this would certainly include 'The Gold Rush' from 1925. No argument here, this is a truly great piece of filmed cinema, a masterpiece. His 15-20 masterpieces are about an even mix of full length feature films and short length films, probably 9-10 of each.'The Gold Rush' was not only Directed by Charlie Chaplin, but he also Produced, wrote the Music and Starred in it, which is the case with almost all of the Films that he Directed. This film has so many legendary scenes, with 'the dancing rolls' being one of the most famous short scenes in the history of filmed cinema. It is Masterful, the way he uses his eyes and eyebrows, it's simple but magical. Chaplin stars in this film alongside Mack Swain and Tom Murray, and they both do an extremely good job in this Film. Georgia Hale has a smaller but critical part in the film and she is tremendous, jumps off the screen and is somehow able to show the vulnerability on a level that Chaplin does, which is saying a ton. Her role also calls for her to show opposite traits at the same time-adamant conceit while having a dainty vulnerability at the same time, and it works tremendously good, she is great in the role.Chaplin was the first to really put multiple emotions in the same Film-mixing humor, sadness, vulnerability, glory, failure, triumph, undertones, overtones. The viewer could not only laugh or cry in the same Movie, but sometimes even in the same scene. It's not that he was the first Director to do it or Pioneer this concept, though that is special in itself; but what makes him so influential and legendary, and what makes him, 110 years later, still on the forefront of today's great Directors, Actors and Historians minds is the fact that he did it so masterfully, so well.I once heard a respected Film Historian say that the best Director and the best Actor in the history of Hollywood are one and the same person, Charlie Chaplin. I do not believe that Chaplin is the best Director ever, but I do believe he remains one of the 10 best ever. In my opinion, the 10 best Director's of all-time are (listed in order from oldest to newest): Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese, Stephen Spielberg, The Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson.Chaplin also remains one of the most influential Director's of all-time, and most all in that Top 10 are. Chaplin helped define what Motion Pictures could be, period. Hollywood's first huge star, and still almost 110 years later his image is still recognized by almost everyone, even kids that have never watched a Chaplin movie; but they somehow know his image and if shown the image, they know it's Chaplin, like it's born into us at birth. Never has there been an Actor/Director that we can say that about, other than Chaplin. And during the 1920s when this Film was released, it can't be overstated, he was the biggest Star and the most recognizable person in the World; and the highest paid employee in the World.In my opinion, 'The Gold Rush' is his best Film, 'thee' masterpiece of a man that made many. It has almost become a National pastime for Film Historians to argue what the best Chaplin Films are. I believe if we talked to the 100 most respected Film Historians around the World, they would all have slightly different orders, but I think this would be their consensus; the Top 10 Films Directed by Charlie Chaplin:1. City Lights (1931) 2. Modern Times (1936) 3. The Circus (1928) 4. The Kid (1921) 5. The Gold Rush (1925) 6. The Great Dictator (1940) 7. Limelight (1952) 8. Monsier Verdoux (1947) 9. The Idle Class (1921-short film) 10. A Dog's Life (1918-short film)I would have a slightly different order, and I would include 'A Woman Of Paris' (the only masterpiece that he Directed but did not Star in). My order would be:1. The Gold Rush (1925) 2. The Kid (1921) 3. A Woman Of Paris (1923) 4. Modern Times (1936) 5. City Lights (1931) 6. The Circus (1928) 7. A Dog's Life (1918-short film) 8. Limelight (1952) 9. Monsier Verdoux (1947) 10. The Great Dictator (1940)The Gold Rush is a must see, a truly great piece of Filmed Cinema."
TrusTinsanity,"Jul 23, 2024",8/10,"(I watched the one with sound added)I really liked this film. It's really funny and the plot is great. The acting is amazing and it's paced well. It's not too long or too short but I guess I would have liked more from the ending.I don't really get why this is so highly rated even though I really enjoyed it because it doesn't leave all too much of an impression on you. I think it should have something like a 7.9 or 8.0 not 8.1. Anyways, I liked Chaplin, he's a chad. This film is one of those films where you don't really think about it after you watch it.You go in the theatre, have a laugh, leave and never think about it again.9/10 Very old but still not 100 years old."
jgcorrea,"Aug 27, 2025",7/10,"Unlike Chaplin's later works, the plot is thin and not well writen. The movie consists of two almost separated plots who are tied together at the end. Both plots are alright, but I liked the ""wilderness/cabin/gold digger-plot"" (the first part) better. The ending is fortunately alright. Some sequences are undeniably legendary: the shoe-eating scene, the cabin teetering on a cliff, and the dancing dinner rolls. These moments hold magic and show Chaplin's ability to turn misery and despair into funny comedy."
kurosawakira,"Jan 29, 2013",8/10,"For me, Chaplin's ""City Lights"" (1931) has been the quintessential work by the great man, yet lately I've been inclined to revisit his early works. As such, ""City Lights"" serves as a kind of watershed. His prior work basks in certain boisterousness and hyper-energy that his later work, whilst impeccably refined, does not exhibit to the same degree. Perhaps there is a sense of self- consciousness that many later works display. Perhaps these early works, now that I'm revisiting them so consciously in retrospect, contain more of Chaplin's exuberance. Or then it's just me projecting, aggressively.Be that as it may, ""The Gold Rush"" (1925) is an altogether enchanting film. Tragicomic in its exultation of love on one hand and its portrayal of the love here as a mere fling on the other, there are many wonderful visual moments that have been used to build our cinematic pantheon: the cottage in the storm, the eating of the shoe, the roll dance. And in the midst of the fireworks, there's Chaplin himself, his timing perfectly nuanced, his expressions fresh. He is at his most handsome, charismatic and unforgettable in how he reacts to the roll dance reception – just look at the man!I prefer the longer, original 1926 cut to the 1942 sound version, mainly because I just can't see the point in having the voice-over. The newer version cuts a few corners, some of which are for the better, and perhaps it is the voice-over that allows Chaplin to do it, but I don't see it as so much tighter a film to encourage myself to revisit it as often as the 1925 cut. The older version breathes and never lags. It could, however, be a nice experience to watch the 1942 cut with the sound off.Whichever your preference, the beautiful Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) is worth its weight in gold, as are all their Chaplin releases for that matter."
paulsrobinson,"May 21, 2013",8/10,"The Gold rush is the second Charlie Chaplin film I've watched recently the other being Modern Time, and both have blown me away. I remember watching scenes of Chaplin as a child but i never watch any from beginning to end as i can remember.The Simple story of a lone prospector travelling to find his fortune, but instead may have found love. The film contains some of Chaplin's most famous scenes. The dancing Potatoes which still today is still hysterical and utterly charming and sweet. Which everyone has probably tried to emulate at some point in their lives. Also the scene involving Chaplin and a cohort eating one of his shoes which is very funny and iconic. The master of slapstick physical humour, you just have to love the childlike nature and innocence of the Tramp character. Whose sentimentality can just warm your heart and make you smile.I think out of two i have scene i prefer Modern Times but that along with The Gold Rush, and Charlie Chaplin in general just have a timeless quality and still remain so effective even now, 80 years on."
gbill-74877,"Jan 12, 2018",10/10,"Chaplin's masterpiece has it all - brilliant slapstick, endearing pathos, dangerous adventure, and an improbable romance besides. Here The Tramp is in the Klondike during the gold rush in the 1890's, and while he hardly looks or acts like a prospector, we identify with him as he endures hardship, befriends 'Big Jim' (Mack Swain), survives close quarters with the murderous Black Larsen (Tom Murray), falls for a woman who toys with him (Georgia Hale), and puts up with her bullying boyfriend (Malcolm Waite).The New Year's Eve scene is incredibly touching, both in The Tramp's humiliation when he's stood up by his date and listens forlornly to the celebration in the nearby dance hall, but also in the faces Chaplin (as director) puts the camera on while 'Auld Lang Syne' is being sung. It truly is one of the best scenes you'll ever see - and on that same evening, while the Tramp dreams of entertaining his guests, he does his ""dinner roll dance"", a brilliant, iconic moment in cinema. I also love the scene where he and Big Jim eat one of his shoes after boiling it - Chaplin more enthusiastically, really digging in as if it were a piece of meat, and as if the nails were thin bones. There are also some wonderfully dark moments when out of starvation Big Jim imagines the Tramp as a giant chicken and comes at him with an axe. Throughout it all, Chaplin is so sweet and charming, and we root for him as the underdog while laughing at his innovative humor. Truly deserving of its reputation, and an absolute joy to watch."
wijajo-72563,"Sep 26, 2023",8/10,"I'm once again surprised how much I enjoyed a silent film. The Gold Rush is simultaneously funny, surreal, tragic, uplifting, and moving. Across Alaskan wastes and gold rush towns, we're treated to some great slapstick scenes. Not only does Chaplin meet a colourful array of characters, but he also meets some animal friends too.Even without sound or much dialogue, I found myself far more invested in the central character's fortunes than many modern films. And part of the beauty of slapstick is that you never know what's coming next - the characters' luck swings wildly in and out of their favour!It's the first Chaplin I've seen and I look forward to seeing more."
SpoonChaser,"Nov 2, 2024",9/10,"Chaplin as the little tramp in Alaska during the gold rush, discovering the lovely Georgia (Hale) and her unlovely friends who tease and torment him relentlessly until his partner (Swain) stakes a huge claim.Chaplin is the master of movement, and he showcases his unique ability to climb, leap, bend and contort as he's pulled from pillar and post in a trademark physical role whether it's evading the ire of a dance hall thug, or trying not to slide off a mountain cliff.Timing is usually everything in slapstick, although the humour here is a bittersweet reflection of his character's loneliness and destitution, an outsider with limited prospects either in love or in life. Blends comedy, tragedy and romance effortlessly in a slightly overlong but nonetheless touching rags to riches story."
TakeTwoReviews,"May 6, 2022",7/10,"I'm having a bit of a Chaplin season, this following on from The Kid. It makes sense to watch these films back to back. To slip a modern film in between would be a bit jarring and I'm enjoying having my cinematic sensibilities reset by Chaplin's silent era vision. His appearance here is much quicker than in The Kid. He's now a star. Here he's The Lone Prospector, although to all intents and purposes he's still The Tramp. He's a character we're designed to feel for, as he struggles in the snowy wilderness, looking for gold in the earth, shelter from the harsh winter weather and safety from the more suitably dressed outdoorsmen whom share the screen with him. It's certainly dramatic with gunfights, the threat of starvation and Big Jim (Mack Swain) deliriously imagining that our hero is a giant tasty chicken. Daft as that sounds, it's pretty violent really. That is until our hero prospector meets Georgia (Georgia Hale) at a dancehall in the new mining town and falls in love. Sadly Georgia isn't as sweet and innocent as the doe eyed prospector. It doesn't quite have the well rounded plot of The Kid, but it is still very good and it does have the famous bread roll dance. That now given its fame, seems almost incidental in the storyline. Despite being the downtrodden character, the prospector is the nicest man in the room and with any luck, soon to be the richest. Maybe it's that The Kid set the bar so high, but this feels a bit lacking in comparison. There's a whole subplot with the wanted Black Larsen (Tom Murray) that essentially gets forgotten about and as it nears its finale, everything feels a little rushed, like they're running out of film. It's still charming though. Next up: City Lights."
jack_o_hasanov,"Aug 27, 2021",8/10,"I enjoy watching Chaplin movies even today. Chaplin is a cinema genius. There are great messages in the movie, too."
Vartiainen,"Jun 15, 2017",6/10,"One of Charlie Chaplin's earliest films and still counted amongst his best. In it his signature character, The Tramp, returns in order to look for gold in the Great Klondike Gold Rush.The plot of the film isn't overly complex. None of the Chaplin plots are. Tramp wanders around, gets into trouble, meets a girl, suffers from misfortune, only to end on a happy note. What makes these films so lasting is the comedy and the great drama that is always present despite the comedy. And very much so in here where the harshness of the time period and the harshness of the location emphasize the drama and the suffering, making the light-hearted scenes all the sweeter for it.And the comedy is really good. Personally, as a man born near the end of the century, I do find it a bit slapsticky and repetitive. But that's the nature of comedy, of art in general. People change, societies change and thus tastes change. I can still appreciate it and the impact it has left without rolling on the floor tears of laughter in my eyes.The Gold Rush is Charlie Chaplin in a nutshell. City Lights emphasizes his storytelling and dramatic moments, but this has better comedy in my opinion. Definitely worth a watch for all interested in the roots of cinematic comedy."
Ahmad_Lasto,"Jul 11, 2012",8/10,"I watched this movie because a friend needed me to write a critique about it for his Writing 204 course, and i did not expect to like a black & white movie! The Gold Rush is about a poor man, Charlie Chaplin, who struggles through life until he becomes rich. The story is great, funny, interesting, whatever you may like to call it, but what should grab your attention is how a ninety-percent-silent-movie (narrated only) in black & white can make you stare at the screen for so long without waiting for someone to talk, or actually not wanting anyone to talk anymore. This is how you can tell an actor can actually act or not. Charlie Chaplin wanted everyone to remember him for this, The Gold Rush, and it is the most famous movie of his, alongside City Lights of course. Georgia, Chaplin's love in this movie, is a person i did not like very much for some reason, however, Chaplin did show affection for her that i don't think any of those High School Musical kids could ever show to their own parents! He makes you feel that he cares about her in real life too and makes you Google her now and see if she is still alive. You'll be doing that a second after finishing The Gold Rush. Don't disappoint me, watch it."
SnoopyStyle,"Aug 14, 2014",10/10,"It's the Great Gold Rush in Alaska. The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is a lone prospector followed by a bear going up the mountain. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) has staked out a lucky claim. In a blinding snow storm, Chaplin takes shelter in a cabin where fugitive Black Larsen (Tom Murray) is hiding. Big Jim also finds shelter in the cabin. As time goes by, things gets harder and harder. Black Larsen goes off, kills some people and discovers Big Jim's secret claim. Big Jim gets back and is hit with a shovel by Larsen. Big Jim wonders off with amnesia while Larsen falls off a cliff. Chaplin arrives in town and abandons gold mining. He finds the beautiful Georgia in the Monte Carlo dance hall. She ignore him until she needs him to help avoid a brutish customer. Hank Curtis is a good Samaritan who helps Chaplin in his time of need. While Hank is away, Chaplin is given the cabin. Georgia agrees to a New Year's Eve dinner as a cruel joke on the Tramp. Big Jim arrives in town but he's forgotten the way to his claim. He needs the Tramp's help to find his way back to the cabin.The scenes in the cabin are hilarious, iconic and full of life. It's slapstick classics. There're the shoe eating, the dancing rolls, and the cabin. The Tramp is charming in this and the shoe eating scene is the best example of that. The tilting cabin and the wind blown cabin are great physical comedy scenes. One can't help but love the Tramp and Big Jim. The romance is the weak point. Georgia needs to show more care with her dealings with the Tramp. It would have been better if the joke was played by one of her friends instead. At least, she redeems herself in the end."
mjneu59,"Nov 23, 2010",10/10,"The Little Tramp goes prospecting in the Yukon but it's Chaplin himself who strikes gold, mining a rich vein of humor and creating, next to his own 'City Lights', one of the most enduring comedies of all time. Oddly enough, some of the best gags are built around some truly awful circumstances: starvation in a snowbound mountain cabin (shades of the Donner party), and the tramp's frustrated love for a beautiful but sometimes brutally insensitive dance hall girl, played by Georgia Hale with atypically headstrong independence for a Chaplin film (he usually favored more passive Victorian ingénues). The familiar Chaplin pathos rears it's head in several scenes, and the expected climax is missing (the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff is an unconvincing model; Buster Keaton would have done it for real), but this is the comedy Chaplin hoped to be remembered by, and for good reason: his 'Little Fellow' was never more dignified, playful, optimistic, or resourceful. The effort, this time, was rewarded: in the end he gets the girl and, for once, lives happily ever after."
Thanos_Alfie,"Jan 24, 2014",8/10,"""The Gold Rush"" I think is one of the best Charlie Chaplin's movies of all time. Charlie Chaplin make a hilarious movie ""mocking"" the 1898 Gold Rush to Alaska.I think that in this movie Charlie Chaplin wants to show us many other things that have to do with the Gold Rush and how this affect our own lives even today. I also believe that ""The Gold Rush"" is a diachronic movie and we can get many information from it even nowadays, such as almost on all of the movies made by Charlie Chaplin and this is one of the most important things of Charlie Chaplin.Finally I want to tell you that you have to see this movie like all the other movies of Charlie Chaplin."
alexv1208,"Sep 16, 2010",8/10,"After viewing the Gold Rush, my initial thought was ""that was a pretty good movie for a silent film"". Honestly, I had my apprehensions at first. I thought that a silent film wouldn't be too exciting, however, I had never really seen an entire film of this sort. The Gold Rush was confusing for me at first, I didn't understand what was going on when the scenes switched from being in the middle of nowhere, to being in a small town. Other than that, I appreciated the fact the Charlie Chaplin was so innovative, and his camera skills were impressive for the 1920's. The acting was humorous and understandable. It was surprisingly easy for me to relate to the characters because of their exaggerated facial expressions and body language. The only part of the film I did not like was when the house was falling of the cliff, it was a little too obvious that it wasn't real, but then again there weren't the same technological advances then as there are now. Overall, The Gold Rush was a great silent film for my first experience."
mckennaniedhammer,"Jan 30, 2021",8/10,"Although silent movies have slipped under this generations radar for the most part, this classic brings light into the history of the early 1900s. Chaplin found a way to mix comedy, with some tragic moments attached without affecting the overall mood of the movie. Even as the plot darkened and the men began to starve, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of the actors reactions and gestures.The film was fast paced, helping to keep the movie from becoming tiring and the actors were phenomenal at depicting the thoughts and scenes without much subtitle use needed. Although, there was a few times I found myself getting mixed up between the characters, they each had their own storyline and that helped to pull me back in before I found myself too lost. For such an old movie though, I have to say the set and camera shots were impeccable and almost put me in disbelief that this movie will be turning 100 years old in a couple short years. Definitely a classic that highly exhibits Chaplins creativity and character, along with his effort to create an advanced movie for its time. I have never been able to delve into a silent film, or even a black and white film for that matter, but this one made it very easy to become lost in the scenes, especially because they move with some speed. Highly recommend!"
hkystar09,"Oct 1, 2010",7/10,"Charlie Chaplains movies are some of the greatest works in movie history. He created a world where all you needed to tell a story was great visual humor and great characters. He showed how one many can beat the odds, save the day and get the girl. ""The Gold Rush"" is a perfect example of his ability to do so.By todays standards, the quality of ""The Gold Rush"" is terrible. a movie could be shot in an infinitely better resolution and not to mention in color for less than one hundred dollars. or by the phones most of us have in our pockets. One thing that Chaplin had that you can't buy at Radio Shack, is his vastly superior ability to make a film.The most significant part of this film is Chaplains ability to use his physical comedy and visual humor to tell an amazing story. anyone who loves movies should put this right on their must watch list."
kevin-12921,"Jan 13, 2026",7/10,"It was moving along okay, glad it wasn't much longer than an hour and seventeen minutes. It seemed the other characters were there just to give Chaplin a chance to work on his physical bits of humor and mercifully disappear.Even Georgia's time on screen appeared too contrived for me-both before he strikes it rich and at the conclusion. However that extended scene in the cabin was masterful. Both Chaplin and ""Big"" Jake (Mack Swain) were so entertaining and even scary.I am glad I stuck with this until the end."
Prince-P,"Sep 9, 2024",8/10,"It all began in 1923 when Charlie Chaplin was reading ""The National Geographic"". The magazine contained photographs of prospectors in the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, trekking through a heavy blizzard. It also carried an article about the Donner Party Disaster, when a group of snowbound immigrants in the Sierra Nevada were forced to eat their own shoes in order to survive. Chaplin, who believed tragedies and comedies were never far apart, realized he could use these images in a new movie. The foundation for ""The Gold Rush"" was laid.Chaplin had an artificial mountain constructed in his Hollywood studio to mimic the harsh conditions in Alaska. 250 tons of plaster, 285 tons of salt, 100 barrels of white flour and four carts of confetti were used for the elaborate set. At the end of the year, however, work had to be halted because the movie's leading lady, Lita Grey, turned out to be pregnant. Charlie Chaplin was, therefore, forced to find an actress who could take over her role while he and Miss Gray travelled to Sonora, Mexico, to carry out a hastily arranged marriage.Back at work, Chaplin brought his camera crew to shoot on location in Sierra Nevada. Here, he recreated the famous images of the gold-diggers struggling up the windswept Chilkoot Pass. More than 600 extras, mainly vagrants from downtown Sacramento, were hired on a day-to-day basis. In front of Chaplin and his cameramen, they then got to clamber the 2,000-foot pass dug through the thick snow.The film had its big gala premiere at Grauman's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. And it was a spectacular affair, to say the least. The live presentation before the cinema featured a school of ""dancing"" seals performing on an icy crag, followed by a group of singing Eskimo girls. The film then continued its victory parade around the world. Ultimately, ""The Gold Rush"" turned out to be the highest-grossing comedy of the entire silent movie era."
Sebastian_X,"Jun 30, 2022",9/10,"Even Modern Times and The Great Dictator popularly stealing the title of best endings in their movies, and even though I prefer the final scene of The Circus, when I finish seeing them all, it still gives me the feeling that they weren't as moving as The Gold Rush, maybe you can compete for this title with City Lights, but this work as a whole will hardly be able to be surpassed.The film takes place in a cold place and full of problems for the character, but it ends in such a warm and comfortably pleasant way, even though the future has its uncertainty, the journey is as innocent and fun, as the scene of the bear on the mountain, or the house almost falling off a cliff as they struggle to get out, but the bar scene is my favorite.Chaplin manages to keep the charm of every detail so charming, and who knew that a pinch of romance would still fit so well in the midst of so many uncertainties, I think it will be hard to forget so much beauty..."

JoshuaC96,"Sep 14, 2010",8/10,"The Gold Rush is the first silent film that I have scene. I've seen short clips from other Charlie Chaplin films, but I had never watched a full length movie. I have to say I really enjoyed it. I was very impressed with both the writing and acting in Gold Rush. Going into it I was somewhat expecting see a lot of random slapstick comedy and a disorganized story. However, the movie actually had a very coherent and entertaining plot. Charlie's acting was phenomenal in my opinion. His facial expressions and demeanor were really effective. Also, just the way he moved and his behavior were hilarious. I also thought all of the gags and physical comedy in the movie were great. While watching it I noticed that a lot of the jokes were predictable to me because I've seen similar things in so many other films. (For example; when Charlie and the minor, who had been looking for Charlie, crossed paths without noticing one another.) This is really interesting because guys like Chaplin were pioneers in film comedy and were the first to use a lot of these comedic techniques."
nicolechan916,"Oct 3, 2015",7/10,"I am not sure if it is because there is a problem with the recovery of this film, but I found the cuts in the middle of the film confusing. The linearity of the narrative comes into question as we see Chaplin in the town, then up in the mountains, and back without an apparent transition from the two locations.Chaplin's films unlike Keaton's focus a lot more on his persona and characters around him. While Keaton engages with objects during gags, Chaplin engages with people, and both are equally engaging.Chaplin's tramp persona is always seen as the outcast, and with great composition shots, gains the sympathies of the audience. Examples of this is apparent in the mountain scene when he walks alongside the mountain and his lone figure is contrasted by this enormous mountain. There is also another great shot taken in the dance club where he first meets Georgia, here the camera is located behind Chaplin as he stands in the shadows looking at the dance floor. Both great shots that emphasize his loneliness and separateness from society.While I do enjoy this film, I must confess that Keaton's had me more engaged. Chaplin's gags are either subtle or extravagant and mostly emits from his tramp persona. The most remarkable 'gag' in this film is with the scene in the house, and to be honest, it got a bit repetitive after awhile. It was still enjoyable though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",6/10,"Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush (1925) is one of the most celebrated silent comedies ever made, and it's easy to see why-it has inventive gags, iconic imagery, and Chaplin's signature blend of humor and pathos. But your 6/10 suggests a fair stance: admiration from a distance. You respect it, maybe even enjoy parts of it, but it doesn't leave a lasting emotional impact.The film follows Chaplin's Little Tramp as he ventures into the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush, battling hunger, snowstorms, and loneliness. Some sequences are undeniably legendary-the shoe-eating scene, the cabin teetering on a cliff, and the dancing dinner rolls have been referenced and parodied endlessly. These moments still hold a magical quality, showing Chaplin's peerless ability to turn poverty and desperation into graceful comedy.Performance-wise, Chaplin is as expressive and agile as ever. His Tramp walks the line between tragedy and humor, wide-eyed yet resilient in the harshest conditions. He brings vulnerability to a character that could easily be just slapstick. But for those not swept away by the silent-era rhythm, the charm might wear thin. The pacing feels slow by modern standards, and some comedic setups stretch longer than they need to.Visually, the film is ambitious. The snowbound sets, clever miniatures, and physical stunts all contribute to a vivid sense of place and scale. The cinematography, especially in the restored versions, holds up beautifully. Yet, even with this technical polish, the emotional arc can feel a bit slight or too tidy.The romance subplot lacks depth-Georgia, the love interest, serves more as a symbol of hope than a fleshed-out character. This contributes to a feeling that while the film has moments of magic, it's more a series of clever set pieces than a compelling, cohesive narrative.Chaplin's score (in the reissued version) is gentle and fitting, enhancing the moods without overwhelming them. But like the rest of the film, it supports more than it elevates.In summary, The Gold Rush is easy to appreciate, but harder to love for everyone. It's clever, influential, and occasionally moving-but it doesn't always fully resonate emotionally. A 6/10 reflects that respectful yet detached viewing experience: a film you're glad exists, but not one you're eager to revisit."
dwanehoyt_jrstaff,"Sep 21, 2010",8/10,"This was the first silent film that I've ever watched all the way through and I'm sure glad I did. I've always thought that Charlie Chaplin was a genius and it shows in this film extraordinarily. This film is the perfect film to start with if your a beginner in watching silent films, or even classic movies in general. The film keeps the viewer entertained and it's hard to find a boring part although some points are rather repetitive. One of the best parts of the film is that dialogue is not necessary, the antics in the film speak for themselves. All in all I would give this film an 8 out of 10 because it's such an entertaining movie that anyone can watch, it doesn't matter if your not into classic films, or silent films for that matter, the comedy featured is classic and transcends time and CC is an absolute comedic genius and icon."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"Apr 5, 2021",8/10,"The Gold Rush (1925) :
Brief Review -The Gold of A Film despite the rush of Chaplin's trademark Comedy. The Gold Rush is one of the most popular Classic of Charlie Chaplin's early days and it is a worth watch. It came as the second Classic of Chaplin's career after Cult film 'The Kid' (1921), of course excluding not so good 'A Woman Of Paris' (1923). Hypothetically speaking, The Gold Rush runs a riot in trademark Chaplin style which had not became a trademark by then, so the potential remains low and then the film surpasses it by margin. The Gold Rush is about four Characters, unknown to each other they are linked somehow. A prospector goes to the Klondike in search of gold, he is accompanied by the tramp for some time to have a great friendship later on. In between, the tramp falls in love with the bar girl who isn't much attracted to him but as expected it works later. The Gold Rush is full of adventures and the comedy is generated through those adventurous situations. A sort of dramatic and fantasy touch works fantastically because the innovative concept of creating comedy is immensely attractive. The only fault this film has is it lacks the good love-story. The girl doesn't seem like a charming material to fall in Love with and the love story isn't as lovable it should have been. Several classic comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Llyod had much better Love Stories than The Gold Rush at that time. Excluding that one big falter, The Gold Rush is flawless entertainer. Charlie Chaplin's amazing act during adventures, his get up and that one leg shoe are the things to remember from the film. Overall, it packs a solid punch of comedy, humour, creative scenes, friendship and drama with slightly downed romance. In one word, A Classic Comedy-Drama.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest."
bretttaylor-04022,"Sep 5, 2021",9/10,"I've watched a few silent movies now from earlier years and they are sometimes very difficult to watch. They wear you out, they have high critical acclaim that I just dont seem to get and they are quite often just not entertaining, rewatchable and you would not recommend them to casual audiences.With Chaplin you get no annoying tinting and you instantly get the character of the Tramp and you can totally understand why he was the most successful movie star in the world at this time.Here he looks totally out of place in the harsh winters of Alaska and it seems like he has wandered into the most hostile and realistic western made up to this point. He is absolutely incredible as he balances the line between hilarious and desperation. His character is either suffering from extreme starvation, in extreme danger or depressingly lonely in every part of the movie. It is absolutely nail biting and intense at times but hilarious at the same time.Charlie Chaplin is still one of the most recognized film stars in history and he lives up to the hype."
infosurahalwaqiah,"Feb 20, 2025",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is a cinematic gem, blending humor, adventure, and deep life lessons. His Little Tramp faces hunger, loneliness, and hardships, much like how faith helps us endure struggles. Just as Chaplin's journey leads to fortune, Surah Yaseen provides spiritual guidance, hope, and strength in difficult times. The film's iconic moments, from the dancing rolls to the daring escape, showcase resilience and determination. Its timeless storytelling and emotional depth continue to inspire, proving that perseverance, like faith, leads to ultimate reward. I can suggest you read it."
springfieldrental,"Jan 27, 2022",9/10,"Charlie Chaplin was a guest of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford at their Pickfair home when the couple showed pictures of the harsh conditions the prospectors faced during the Alaskan Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890's. The comedian was so impressed by those who staked their lives for gold nuggets he developed what turned out to be one of cinema's most famous silent movies.Of all the superior films he had produced, Chaplin's August 1925 ""The Gold Rush"" was the one movie he claimed he most wanted to be remembered. He reveled at the combination of comedy, sentimentality and a touch of sadness and elation on the story of The Lone Prospector (Chaplin) journeying to Alaska to try his luck to become rich. Once there, he stumbles upon Big Jim (Mack Swain), who had discovered and misplaced the site where a large deposit of gold vein was buried. The two get mixed up with a wanted criminal, Black Larsen, who knocks out Big Jim but gets killed in an avalanche. Chaplin goes on his own way. He comes across a settlement where he meets and invites Georgia (Georgia Hale) and her friends to his cabin for a New Year's Eve party. The women decide to go elsewhere, setting up one of the saddest New Year's Eve sequences ever put on film.In real life, Chaplin got his new flame, 16-year-old Lita Grey, who was originally scheduled to play the role of Georgia, pregnant. He was forced to marry her in a quickie Mexican wedding to evade being arrested for statutory rape of a minor. Chaplin switched her with Georgia Hale, whom he spotted while viewing Josef von Sternberg's ""The Salvation Hunters."" The two fell in love during the production. The last clip of ""The Gold Rush"" shows how crazy they were to each other with a concluding passionate kiss. In 1942 when Chaplin narrated the movie with his personally-composed musical score, the director didn't want to show the kiss since the two had broken up soon after the filming. So he faded to black a minute earlier than the original.""The Gold Rush"" is famous because of several scenes. One is when starving Big Jim and Chaplin are in the cabin seeking shelter from a raging blizzard. Resorting to eating their shoes, The Lone Prospector prepares an exquisite meal of shoe leather and nails. The shoe was made up of licorice so it could be eaten and look like a real one. Being the ultimate movie perfectionist, Chaplin insisted on filming over 60 takes. He ate so much licorice he had to be rushed to the hospital for insulin shock.In the next scene, his appetite not satisfied with shoe leather, Big Jim is so hungry he's hallucinating by seeing Chaplin as a chicken. A stagehand was given the simple job of wearing a chicken suit and strutting around the cabin. After several takes, Chaplin was unhappy with the stagehand's failure to imitate the comedian's famous walk. Chaplin ended up in the chicken suit himself.One other memorable sequence is when Chaplin, waiting for the women to join him for that New Year's Eve dinner, ends up falling asleep. In his dreams the women are highly entertained by The Prospector's antics. He pierces two bread rolls with a pair of forks and has them dance on the table. The sequence was so popular with theater audiences some projectionists stopped the movie, reversed the film, and replayed the dance. The skit was first created by Roscoe Arbuckle in his 1917 ""The Rough House.""
After the disappointing box office returns for Chaplin's first United Artists film, ""A Woman In Paris,"" which he didn't act in, ""The Gold Rush"" was his first major appearance in a UA production. And it was a phenomenal success at the box office. It has since gained quite a reputation well after its initial release. ""The Gold Rush"" was the fifth highest grossing silent film in history. The American Film Institute named the Chaplin classic as the 58th Best Movie of All Time and #25 Funniest film ever. Entertainment Weekly has it as the 15th of its 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. ""The Gold Rush"" is included in the '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.' Fellow directors, including Akira Kurosawa and Guillermo del Toro, have said this is one of their favorite films."
colm-hearne365,"Nov 20, 2012",9/10,"Charlie Chaplin is of course, famous for making silent classics like City Lights, The Circus, The Kid and Modern Times with is iconic character, The Tramp (or the Little Fellow as Chaplin called him or the Lone Prospector), but this is the film that he'd hoped to be most remembered for and he truly is! Plus, it's one of his personal favourites and it's also my favourite film by him.One of the reason's why this is Chaplin's best is because it has some of the Tramp's most memorable and funniest moments. Such as the ""dancing"" with rolls, the cabin over the cliff and when Big Jim imagines he's a chicken. Also, I like how Chaplin himself is narrating the film and it gives a nice touch because he has more of a presence in the film. And Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) is a great comedy sidekick.It also has, in my opinion, the best ending because the Tramp goes off rich and famous with his friend Big Jim and he gets the girl of his dreams, Georgia (Georgia Hale)."
Rayve777,"Jun 22, 2023",8/10,"The Gold Rush is a pretty great movie, although some of the vignettes during the middle part of the film felt less developed than those in Modern Times. My favorite parts of this movie were when the Tramp was in the cabin with the other prospector during the beginning and end of the film, particularly with the iconic climax of the cabin hanging off the edge of a cliff. The physical comedy during those scenes are an absolute joy to watch. The finale where the Tramp finally gets with Georgia is also quite sweet, and while I wish that their relationship with each other was a little bit more developed, it's a pretty nice conclusion nonetheless."
tiffany_demeo,"Sep 12, 2010",10/10,"After watching ""The Gold Rush"" i now have a better appreciation for silent films and the era of silent films. I came into the movie with negative connotations about silent films and wondered, ""How could a film with no dialogue be interesting?"" I soon realized how this film became to be known as a masterpiece. Without dialogue, the actors really had to show how they were feeling through their movements and gestures. With the plot of a Gold Rush as a backdrop, the film really showed how one had to brave the elements of a harsh winter.No dialogue also made the comedic scenes so much better. The comedy usually came through hardships or mishaps and the dramatic scenes included comedy. This was a trademark of Chaplin's style.A scene that really stood out in my head and showed how genius Chaplin was as an actor is the scene is which Chaplin skillfully prepares his own shoe as a meal. The way Chaplin treat the shoe as an actual piece of food is hilarious. Chaplin is nonchalantly eating his shoes like it is normal and it just makes you want to laugh.Overall, it was an amazing movie and made me appreciate the silent film era to a great extent."
metodico,"Nov 21, 2024",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin manages to offer a magical experience without colors, without voices and without complex direction... ""The Gold Rush"" is a simple, human and beautiful work, about the miserable existence of a man who lives in Alaska, and above all, it shows the reality of human existence, despite being a humorous film, Chaplin manages to show our misery, to show that the ""search for gold"" is actually a search for love, and the beauty of cinema is on the screen, and thanks to this art we have a moment of sanity, a moment where we realize that our miserable existence is not just the fault of chance. This review is actually one of my love letters to the seventh art, and one of the goals of cinema is to offer this beauty, which we do not find (unfortunately) in everyday life."
wumbi,"Nov 5, 2021",7/10,"It is a masterpiece in its own right despite my seemingly low rating, and one of Chaplin's best. Although I'm not a huge fan of slapstick comedy I can still understand the appeal to some. Fortunately for me this movie has a great and heartwarming story that I can enjoy. Completely innocent and understand nothing of other's cruelty while bringing humor even in the most desperate times, his character is a joy to watch."
vuralergin,"Jun 10, 2022",10/10,"This is first film i watched Charlie Chaplin and i loved it. Actually i have prejudice about Chaplin until today. I dont know, i would think he is overrated director but now i am thinking he is a genius. His cinema is pure and simple. I'll watch his other movies as soon as."
barryrd,"Dec 23, 2012",9/10,"The Gold Rush, made in 1925, is a silent movie with a series of hilarious and bittersweet skits that are so well acted and so hard to stop watching that I was left with the feeling that I had seen one of the great classics. Charlie Chaplin is the creator of this movie, as leading actor, director and writer. The movie does what a silent movie should and that is, it left me with a visual experience quite unlike other movies I am used to seeing. In the movie, Chaplin is partnered with a character named Jim MacKay (Mack Swain)whose size and persona are the opposite of Chaplin. The dinner scene with the boots as the meal was so imaginative and realistic, that one could imagine him devouring a delectable meal. Later a cliffhanging scene shows the two of them running back and forth across a one room cabin as it teeters on the edge of a cliff. The romance with a girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale) is heartwarming and very innocent by today's standards. In one dance scene, the viewer sees the two of them as one embarrassing incident followed another with the floor filled with other dance partners oblivious to the whole scene. Another time he entertains a group of young ladies and uses two buns and forks to simulate a dance routine. All in all excellent entertainment and an example of something lost with the advent of talking movies."
willcundallreview,"Sep 6, 2015",7/10,"Charlie Chaplin is a film star who transcends time and not just for those who enjoy silent movies. Chaplin's movies can be enjoyed today as much as they were back when and his physical and in particular his facial expressions are top notch and a must even today for any true comedic actor. With The Gold Rush you get Chaplin at his best comedic wise, and although maybe I don't think right now I think this movie is incredible, I can still see that Charlie Chaplin is one of the best actors of all time. We see our story set in the rugged gold rush times in Alaska and Canada known as the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin is a lone prospector and he has come to seek his fortune like many others, but some people will help him whilst others will not.The film is as much at times a drama as it is a comedy mixing gags with truly emotional scenes, Chaplin yet again proves himself not only a great actor, but also a director at that level too. Chaplin's little tramp persona (who kind of reminds me of a penguin) arrives to a stormy place and meets Big Jim McKay who is also a lonely prospector and Black Larsen a wanted criminal. I don't want to go into the plot too much as to not ruin it for those who have yet to see this but over time Chaplin's character comes to love, befriend and well ultimately get into some sticky situations. The story I felt was good fun and although maybe not amazing for me personally, it is still very well played out.Chaplin also writes this movie further proving his absolute brilliance as he basically does everything for this movie. His skill is most plain to see in scenes where his character is being flung around or blown away by the fierce storms, the direction is not only superb but the laughs that can be had are a plenty yet again showing Chaplin's awesome humorous acting. The stunts are really well done as well by all involved, in fact Chaplin seems to make a seemingly normal stunt funny, a certain scene in a cabin off a cliff edge is probably the pick of the scenes for me. This movie also shows us some of Chaplin's most famous moments with the shoes, the dancing rolls and well of course his not unique to this movie but Chaplin's walking stick and hat.I think if you feel before watching this that you won't enjoy silent movies then think again, I myself at the time of this review have not ventured into silent's as much as I would like to have but still know from this that many are enjoyable. Is this Chaplin's greatest work? Well it could be but I do feel his movies in the 1930's are what he will be best remembered for and his highest rated although Chaplin of course wanted to be remembered for this one the most and so he should, it is him at the top of his game, and that's even before he did a lot of his more famous one's.Yes this film is good in my opinion, a very likable little adventure and although one I would not say is great, it is still very much worth watching and again afterwards. It may have aged slightly through time but in any case for a movie like this to be better than most it shows that Chaplin not only understood film making but he actually put it into action, made films people loved and cried at whether that be tears of laughter or emotion and in the end made people happy with his cheeky smile and little moustache."
gavin6942,"Dec 16, 2010",7/10,"This is the story of gold prospectors in Alaska, told as a dramatic comedy. There are some memorable scenes with the Tramp eating a shoe, turning into a chicken, dancing the Oceana Roll...Chaplin is great, as always, but this is surely not his best film. It does not compare to ""Great Dictator"" and especially not ""City Lights"". The humor was much more subtle, with the emphasis being more on the viewer feeling sorry for the Tramp. I did laugh when Chaplin pretended to be frozen stiff just to get breakfast, though. And I have to give them credit for a a very respectable bear.If you're like me, you'll find that Georgia (Georgia Hale) has a very familiar face, but perhaps not a very well-known name. And, strangely, she appears in nothing else I know."
tnrcooper,"Jan 3, 2012",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin has influenced film so much it's almost inestimable. His exquisite comic timing, his great touch for the funny move, and his willingness to play the fool infused his comedy with such depth and humanity that probably all comedians following him owe him some debt, whether they realize it or not. He took the funny out of the everyday and applied his genius to entertaining by a unique combination of physical comedy, an exquisite human touch, and a sensitive eye for the funny in the mundane. This is one of his masterworks in that mode.Chaplin plays The Tramp joining the troop of hopeful prospectors trying their luck at the Klondike Gold Rush. He encounters an affable lug - Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) with whom he finds fugitive Black Larsen (Tom Murray) and who they both end up facing off. Charlie ends up overseeing a cabin nearer the center of the gold prospecting and encounters the lovely Georgia (Georgia Hale) who he falls for but who is uninterested in him.The set pieces in this film - Charlie and Big Jim eating a shoe, their cabin balancing on the edge of a cliff, Charlie attempting to avoid a gun being pointed at him when Big Jim and Black fight, and Big Jim imagining that Charlie is a chicken - are hilarious. These are great bits and speak to Chaplin's genius. The film progresses at a steady pace and Chaplin integrates the comedic pieces into the film deftly. He gets good work from actors Tom Murray, Mack Swain, and Georgia Mack. It's a movie everyone should see."
drqshadow-reviews,"Sep 25, 2018",8/10,"As hundreds of prospectors rush to the Alaskan permafrost in search of buried fortune, Charlie Chaplin tags along to misguidedly seek their scraps. Entirely unprepared for the harsh climate, he soon finds himself trapped in a small cabin during a snowstorm, along with an on-the-lam criminal and an increasingly insane fellow gold-seeker. That setup is good for a stretch of claustrophobic mayhem, but it's not until the storm ends and the trio split up that things start getting really good.The pace can feel slow at times, pausing to squeeze as much anticipation from each scene as possible, but that all seems worthwhile when everything comes together in the final act. At worst, it's a little drawn-out. At best, a brilliant display of creative scene-setting and cinematic trickery. Chaplin is able to do so much with such limited means, it doesn't even matter that we can see through a few of his visual illusions. In a way, that makes it even more endearing, like a magician who lifts the curtain mid-trick for a sly wink. The Gold Rush is loaded with such ideas; crazy, larger-than-life concepts that work through hustle and sheer power of will. It also bubbles over with little personal moments from the star, whose aloof charisma still shines like a beacon through so many years."
whatever-32088,"Oct 19, 2018",10/10,"Chaplin takes his audience on an adventure to the great gold rush. Imaginative, and brilliant classic comedy suitable for any age. Chaplin's ""prospector"" character takes his luck to the mines and (of course) coming up with some bad luck, gets himself stuck with Big Jim who eventually tries to eat him, then to him falling for a beautiful girl who mocks him. A great story through and through."
Incalculacable,"Jun 30, 2006",9/10,"This 1925 Chaplin film is probably the one I enjoyed most. I don't know what it was about this film, but I was laughing out loud constantly throughout it. Sure, it doesn't have the strong romance of City Lights (1931), but it is as funny  perhaps funnier. But when it comes to any film, it is all up to personal preference. Yep, now I think about it, this is my favourite Chaplin movie.Like most Chaplin films, we have the benefit of a simple plot. The Gold Rush is the story of a tramp (Chaplin's classic character) that sets off to Klondike, Alaska during the Gold Rush craze. However he finds much more including two, to say the least dodgy characters, which lead to some hilarious situations.The only part that I am not so sure of is the romance between Georgia and The Tramp. She doesn't really seem that nice to him, and compared to his other movies, I wasn't that satisfied at the end, which is very disappointing. This is the reason why it is only nine stars out of ten instead of ten out of ten.I really liked the narration on the DVD version, but I'm not sure why. I know some people think it takes away from the movie, but I am of the opinion that it adds to it. Chaplin has a marvelous speaking voice and I like how he guides the story. Apart from this, the DVD is absolutely the way to go for its crisp, clear picture. You'll find you'll miss some of the jokes if your picture is fuzzy.This Chaplin film, which he wrote and directed (like most of his films), is an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to watch. Chaplin is a comic genius. Bravo!"
paulclaassen,"Mar 30, 2023",7/10,"The film might be called 'The Gold Rush', but there's hardly any gold here and certainly no rush. The film starts with Big Jim (Mack Swain) finding gold on a mountain, but with a blizzard approaching, he hides the gold.Charlie Chaplin stars as a character simply known as The Lone Prospector, who is also in search of gold. When the blizzards strikes, he seeks refuge in a cabin, which belongs to wanted criminal Black Larsen (Tom Murray). The three men agree they have no option than to stay together in the cabin until the storm subsides, but when they run out of food, one of them has to go find food. This task is bestowed upon Black Larsen.The film is mainly set in the cabin and Charlie Chaplin delivers his trademark humour to perfection. This guy simply is a comedy genius. I must say, the visuals are remarkable for a film made almost a century ago - especially the scene with the cabin hanging over the edge of a cliff with Big Jim and The Lone Prospector trying to get out. This scene was fantastic!Georgia Hale stars as the film's romance interest, Georgia. The Lone Prospector will do anything to become better acquainted with her! Off course, funny moments ensue. There are quite a few continuity errors, but hey, we'll forgive them for that seeing the film was made in 1925! This is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy with action, adventure, and several awkward moments! We'll also forgive them for the fact the film is more than just a bit cheesy... Sit back and enjoy!"
nukisepp,"Jan 8, 2021",8/10,"'The Gold Rush' might not hold that much of an emotional punch like some other better Chaplin's movies but it is innovativeness, fast-paced story and action make it a captivating movie. The opening shot where the miners head up Chilkoot Pass, composing a trail similar to ants. That was a nice metaphor for how pathetic humans are when left at the mercy of mother nature.The film is pure comedy gold. One hilarious stunt and gag follows another one. Between there are of course nice subtle innuendos and nuances. It wasn't just the row of elaborate jokes - each scene moved the story forward, and to think about - the plot is quite complex, and it rewards the viewer with many unexpected treats. Special effects are fantastic, and it is no exaggeration to say that they hold up very well. And like the other Chaplin's great, this one also carries a strong message and gives hope for the little guy."
I_Ailurophile,"Aug 18, 2023",8/10,"Stir together tinges of adventure and romance with variable levels of comedy, put it all amidst fantastic sets that bring the Yukon to California, and we have ourselves another Charlie Chaplin classic. Some bits herein are wonderfully funny, while others are just lightly amusing; bookend scenes at the start and the finish zero in on a more adventure-laden feel, while there's also some earnest heart on hand to round out the length as the star's all so recognizable protagonist falls for a girl in the town. The strength throughout may be greater at some points more than others, but one way or another there's not much arguing that 'The Gold Rush' is a treasure of a silent film that should be and is rightly revered.Splendid effects and stunts liven up those lovely sets, with excellent costume design, hair, and makeup on top. As Chaplin writes, directs, produces, and edits in addition to starring, he effectively had total control over the final product - and given all his experience in the young film industry by 1925, and as an entertainer, there's no disputing what a keen sense he had for giving audiences a good time. By one measure or another this may not immediately impress as much as some of the man's other works, but that's mostly just a matter of personal preference. Even for those viewers who have a harder time engaging with older pictures, the quality here is so steady that I've a hard time imagining anyone couldn't find something to enjoy.Chaplin is just about as reliable as actors come, highly capable in his range and nuance while also gladly willing to sacrifice his body for a fine gag. Not to be outdone in only a supporting part, Mack Swain brings huge personality to 'The Gold Rush' as ""Big Jim McKay"" to play opposite our star. And among others present here, Georgia Hale is marvelously sweet and charming as the love interest sharing her name. In fact, maybe it was a reflection of their friendship in real life, but even though Hale has less time on-screen than even Swain, it says so much about the warmth she provides for the feature, not to mention Chaplin's intelligence as a filmmaker, that the single best scene in the length may well be the ending that they share. As if the value of the movie was ever in doubt, the last moments solidify it.What more is there to say? More than forty years after he died, and over a century after he first began making his name in cinema, the man remains a household name. Techniques and technology may have progressed, but good comedy never grows old, and the credits of Charlie Chaplin will continue to endure and inspire laughs long after audiences have completely forgotten whatever was released in even just the past year or so. However one may rank this title standing next to its brethren, 'The Gold Rush' holds up as a terrific joy that's well worth revisiting."
frankde-jong,"Feb 1, 2021",8/10,"According to Chaplin himself his best film. I prefer ""The kid"" (1921). In both films Chaplin finds the perfect mix between comedy and sentimentality. In ""The kid"" this mix is realised within one storyline. In ""The gold rush"" it is divided over two storylines. Charlie looking for gold is a vehicle for comedy, Charlie having a romance with Georgia (Gerogia Hale) is a vehicle for sentimentality.However it is true that ""The gold rush"" probably has more ""unforgettable"" scenes then ""The kid"". When I use the term ""unforgettable scenes"" most people will think of the comedy element and the visual gags and brilliant mime involved in scenes as the cabin on the canyon or the little tramp (or ""the lone prospector"" as he is called in this film) changing into a chicken in the delusion of his hungry companion.I in the first place think of the scene of Charlie waiting in vain for Georgia on new years eve. Seldom has loneliness been portrayed so poignant as in this scene"
TabithaNoel,"Feb 1, 2021",8/10,"I would recommend this movie for a first-time silent movie viewer like myself. Charlie Chaplin is a legend when it comes to silent movies. Him and the actors and actresses in this film are spectacular in showing emotion such as sadness, happiness, and going a little bit insane since no words are said in the actual film. I enjoyed the comedy in this film; it was simple yet affective to put a smile on my face at some points and it kind of reminded me of ""The Three Stooges"" at one point. The music did a great job in expression as well when there was a fight, a sad moment, a happy moment, or a moment that is supposed to be a little silly. I also like how they included folk songs such as ""Loch Lomond"" in the middle of the film and ""Auld Lang Syne"" in the dance hall scene on New Year's Eve. All in all, this was a great movie and I would highly recommend it to a person who may want to see a silent movie."
CarolinaJ-6,"Jun 8, 2025",10/10,"In which Chaplin tried to modernize The Gold Rush by taking out the title cards, adding narration which he himself did, changing the music, and deleting some scenes. It isn't bad since Chaplin himself redid it, but I just prefer the original.It isn't as funny as The Kid, not as heartbreaking as City Lights, and it doesn't have the social commentary of Modern Times. Instead it has a little bit of everything plus lots of atmosphere AND it takes Chaplin's Little Tramp out of some anonymous urban environment and lands him in a very specific place and time - the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s. I could feel the biting cold, the hunger, the loneliness. And in spite of this being set in the 1890s and seeming quite authentic to its setting, this film has a very modern feel to it, almost timeless.Chaplin's ""little fellow"" is introduced as a lone prospector. We never see him doing any prospecting, but it is later mentioned that he is not very successful at it and gives it up. The first part of the film has the little fellow waiting out a blizzard in a cabin with a wanted criminal in addition to a fellow prospector. The second part has Chaplin's character traveling to a Klondike boom town, watching a cabin for a more successful prospector, and falling in love with a dance hall girl who thinks his crush is just a big joke, at least at first."

Plus, it's one of his personal favourites and it's also my favourite film by him.One of the reason's why this is Chaplin's best is because it has some of the Tramp's most memorable and funniest moments. Such as the ""dancing"" with rolls, the cabin over the cliff and when Big Jim imagines he's a chicken. Also, I like how Chaplin himself is narrating the film and it gives a nice touch because he has more of a presence in the film. And Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) is a great comedy sidekick.It also has, in my opinion, the best ending because the Tramp goes off rich and famous with his friend Big Jim and he gets the girl of his dreams, Georgia (Georgia Hale)."
EricBarker,"May 28, 1999",10/10,"Legendary silent comedy with Chaplin's Little Tramp venturing to a mythical Alaska, falling in love with the usual unattainable woman, having many episodic adventures.Endlessly inventive, this film contains at least three set pieces that are as funny as anything ever put on film, gags that will provoke knee-jerk laughs from all but the most jaded viewers."
JamesDean1955,"Sep 14, 2010",8/10,"Upon review, i was instantly captivated by Chaplins charisma. I had heard of Charlie Chaplin in my travels but never could truly understand what the craze was about until i saw him in action for the first time. His Ability to capture the audience in a spell of wonder, excitement, and laughter is nothing short of amazing, considering its release date and the fact that it is a silent film. Chaplin is an artist, and entertaining an audience is simply his canvas. His over-exaggerated gestures, facial features, and appearance all add to the magic of his character. The movie itself didn't so much stand out to me, I knew it was about a Gold Rush but, I was more interested in Chaplins performance and his interactions with other actresses and actors of that time period. The film itself held pleasing visuals, once again, considering that it was 1925. All in all the film was delightful, it was my first silent film and was enjoyable. Just imagine if some of todays blockbusters were dubbed silent, most of the ""actors"" wouldn't be able to hold the shortened attention span of the present day audiences for more than thirty seconds!"
christian-tesfaye,"Aug 30, 2013",10/10,"The tramp shares a house with another big guy in the middle of a snow storm during the gold rush. They have no food what so ever, and eating anything other than food(like a shoe) has proved futile. So the big guy gets delirious and gets the urge to eat the little guy(the tramp).If this material was wrote , directed or even acted by somebody else, it would have come out as horror. But out of anyone in this world their is only one person that can make cannibalism look funny.Chaplin is an immortal, many great film makers might be forgotten through time but Chaplin will always live on. I have always laughed at the comparison between him and Buster Keaton. Polls are taken in America every other decade to figure out who is the greatest silent picture star and sometimes Keaton comes first. Well that might be in America but not in any other country. I live in Ethiopia and i was 5 years old when i learned the name Chaplin and 16 when i learn Keaton's. That goes for a lot of people.Surprisingly enough it takes a master to have this film in your resume and its not even your best. City Lights is still the undisputed champion(for me) but this is also a great classic to be enjoyed by any one that wants to have a good time."
k-plekan,"Sep 15, 2010",8/10,"I have never seen a silent movie before I watched this. At first I was skeptical about how it would turn out, especially considering the era that it came from. However I was surprised to see how well together it was considering how low key technology was back then compared to today. The over acting and the music had me both laughing at the comedy and paying more attention to the serious parts, even without the spoken words from the actors. ""The Gold Rush"" kept my attention from beginning to end and made me interested in seeing more silent movies. The storyline was well put together and I can see that type of story happening even today. Overall it was a very good experience to watch this movie and I would recommend it."
lonely-tty,"Aug 26, 2013",10/10,"To be honest, i watched this movie because this is voted as one of the best film, and is my very first silent movie. I always wanted to try all kinds of genre of movies, so i decided to watch. Although i have very high expectation from this movie, but this movie has surpass my expectation. I really enjoyed this movie and i notice most of the modern day comedy film and drama still uses the tactics in this film, although this film probably has copied from even olden days movies, but this movie just hit the bullseye. All the tactics were used and reached the maximum potential. In conclusion, i enjoyed every second of this film. A definitely MUST WATCH before you die!"
jamesrupert2014,"Dec 16, 2025",9/10,"Chaplin's famous 'Little Tramp' character is in the rough and frosty Klondike prospecting for gold and love amidst villains, dancing girls, bears, cruel winds, and lots of snow. This is one of the greatest and best-known films to come out of the 'silent era'. Chaplin was a master of physical comedy, and the film's broad yet clever humour juxtaposed with his trademark pathos holds up well. After a century of analysis and commentary there is nothing I can add beyond: IMO - 'The Gold Rush' was charming and funny a hundred years ago, is charming and funny now, and will be charming and funny a hundred years hence. Note: the version I recently watched on TCM was from 1925 (it ended with a kiss)."
RM851222,"Sep 20, 2015",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Gold Rush"" (1925) is such a warm and pleasant movie to watch. The comedy is great in here, story is simple, yet intriguing. Settings were very good, and some practical effects are a joy to watch. Charles Chaplin was a movie making genius (not only comedy), and you can clearly see this when watching this picture - although scenes look very simple, they are very smartly done. The bread dance sequence is incredible.Overall, ""The Gold Rush"" is a must see for all Charles Chaplin fans. It's funny, superbly created and wonderfully warm movie."
m-bailey8,"Sep 16, 2010",9/10,"The 1925 movie ""The Gold Rush"" is a very good movie for its time. Even though this is a silent movie, it still told a very funny comedy. Though there were no words, it was still funny through Chaplin's facial expressions and various scenes that didn't need words. For example, when Chaplin thought he hit the bad guy, but actually hit the beam instead. Also, when Chaplin thought he was tying his belt on he actually tied a dog on a leash and was leading the dog around.Though the movie was made in 1925, there were scenes that were believable. Like the live bear in the cabin, the cabin tittering off the cliff, the donkey coming into the other cabin, and Chaplin turning into a chicken. The story and the writing for this movie was also well done. Since,honestly, Chaplin was in danger for most of the movie and to have something that's suppose to be dangerous be funny is an interesting way to make a comedy."
the-fearless-america,"Jul 8, 2016",10/10,"The gold rush, an early work from Chaplin after ""The Kid"". This one, integrally one of the most humorous and lightest. A story of a tramp's adventure to a mountain. He meet so many things in the trenches, bear, hunter, and of course a romance, which Chaplins best at. In this masterpiece, which Chaplin prevalent made, consist one of the best performance by the exalted Chaplin. A performance at the dinner, yeah guys, these dancing bread !! Nowadays, you can't call it as acting, we call it as pure talent.Prevailing habits of the audience while witnessing another Chaplin, the feelings of another inspiration, another humanity, another huge applause, and of course another cry. I never understand why he always successfully did it, such a prosperous masterpiece maker. We don't talk about ecclesiastical or pious on Chaplins. He was secular but as triumphant humanism, noble as film-maker. Chaplin is a generous elite that dare and care to us, the next generation. He taught us so many universality which distilled by every scenes within silence. Maybe haunting the viewers with his creation was his hobby. Bring the reconciliation after fights, bring the light after darkness, and bring a smile after sadness, that was Chaplin could do. That was proved for every generation whose already watch his creations. Thank you Chaplin.. from your biggest fan.. 23 years-old boy.."
slokes,"Feb 2, 2010",9/10,"Here's a really dumb idea for a comedy. Stick a guy in the middle of a whited-out Alaskan wilderness, hungry and lonely, his sole companion bent on eating him alive. Oh, yes, throw in a pretty woman to give him the flirt-and-desert treatment. Man, is this getting worse by the minute...What do I know? ""This will make a wonderful story!"" says the reporter on the boat at the end of ""The Gold Rush"". And so it does. In fact, a big reason for admiring the movie is because it really does tell a good story, unusual for comedies back in the mid-1920s when they were designed just to get you from gag to chase and back.Admiration aside, ""The Gold Rush"" is impressive in another big way. It's still deliriously funny.The story: An unnamed prospector called ""the little fellow"" or ""the tramp"" (Charlie Chaplin) struggles to find his fortune and just stay alive during the 1898 Alaska Gold Rush. The story forms two halves. In one, he and his friend Big Jim (Mack Swain) must stave off starvation and help Big Jim rediscover his ""mountain of gold"". In the other, he tries to win the heart of jaded dance-hall girl Georgia (Georgia Hale).The two subplots are not only resolved, but in tandem, a neat trick for any age. At the core of the film's success is Chaplin's way as writer and director of creating empathy for his character's plight.This was not always a plus for Chaplin in my view; he was prone to overload the pathos and artistic sentiment a few times in his career. But here the sympathy we feel for the Tramp is not only genuine and earned but serves to advance the comedy, making the laughs deeper and more satisfying.Take the scene where the Tramp first makes Georgia's acquaintance, in the dance hall where she works. As an establishing shot, we see him in the foreground from the back, arm akimbo, almost totally in darkness as the two-level set in the background is brightly lit. He's obviously the guy in the corner being ignored by the merrymakers around him.Then we see Georgia's first meeting with him. She's talking about how bored she is. ""If I could meet someone worthwhile,"" she says, as he listens, awestruck. Then she turns and looks in his direction. He freezes up, but to no avail, as she looks right past him and walks on.It's funny, yes, but at the same time you feel for the guy. Film comedies have been trying to do this thing ever since, and most often they fail because they overplay the laugh or the pity. Here Chaplin nails it.The three big set pieces people talk about in the film, the Thanksgiving dinner where the Tramp eats a shoe, his dance with the dinner rolls, and the cliffhanger at the end with Big Jim in the cabin, are all bedrock moments of cinema. Yet they exist not in isolation but in tandem with everything else in ""The Gold Rush"".So many other prize scenes here, too, like Charlie's transformation into a chicken and his racket for making money by shoveling snow from one storefront to the next. I'm at a loss as to why there was need for the nominal villain, Black Larson, who does absolutely nothing to advance the story of the film. But he does have a great comic struggle with Big Jim over a shotgun, which always manages to be aimed at the Tramp no matter where he's trying to hide.I would vote for seeing the film in its original 1925 silent state, though I don't think the 1942 version narrated by Chaplin is an atrocity. It just short-changes some of the story elements. For any comedy before ""The Gold Rush"", such trims would be just fine, but ""The Gold Rush"" is not any comedy. It's the mother lode!"
rbverhoef,"Mar 28, 2004",9/10,"One of the great Chaplin movies is 'The Gold Rush' and although it is not his best it contains one of the best known Chaplin-sequences. The sequence with the dancing rolls is one of the best I have seen in any Chaplin, whether it is a feature film or a two-reeler. For me this alone makes 'The Gold Rush' worth watching.There are other great moments in this story where Chaplin is the Lone Prospector who falls in love with a girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale). When Chaplin has to find some gold (the movie isn't name 'The Gold Rush' for nothing) together with Hank (Henry Bergman) they stay in a cottage in the mountains. The sequence with this cottage after a blizzard is another that belongs to the greatest sequences in a Chaplin movie.Of course we know from the start how things will end with the girl and the gold but the way that leads to that point is a nice one. Personally I think it is not great all the time, some sequences make it great, and sometimes even a little too simple. Because of the sequences described above (and some others) and because of the artist that Chaplin is this still belongs to the better silent movies I have seen."
c-feldman,"Sep 15, 2010",N/A,"This is one of Charlie Chaplin best peaces of work he did with silent movies. the way he ties in the comedy and romance was amazing.During the movie Charlie is a miner who gets stuck in a storm at first. he is so hungry he cooks a boot and then eats it i thought this part was really funny, because he eats almost the hole thing before he has to go to the hospital. i also found it funny how he shoveled all the snow from the front of one store to the next. then has that guy pay him to shovel it of and he then shovels it to the store right next to that way and walks away. the romance has to do with Charlie falling in love with the a women called Georgia. Charlie try's to make her fall in love with him but all she does is play tricks on him with her friends. its not till Chaplin gets rich with Big Jim that he gets Georgia to fall in love with him. i felt that this movie was will put together the cast played there parts perfect. also the sounds made the movie flow more smooth. i also felt that Chaplin did a great job making this fell pretty realistic. only a couple parts of the movie to fell so realistic, like at the end with the house on the cliff."

An absolute must-see."
CinemaClown,"Sep 2, 2013",N/A,"The film which Charlie Chaplin wanted himself to be remembered for may not be the film for which he's actually remembered today but that doesn't mean The Gold Rush is any lesser quality work from the legendary auteur, it only means that Chaplin later went on to surpass the very standards he set for himself with this silent classic.The Gold Rush tells the story of a lone prospector who ventures into Alaska looking for gold but ends up finding more than what he asked for. On his journey, he finds many interesting people, gets caught in a blizzard, almost starves to death & also comes across a very beautiful woman whose heart he tries to win with his charm.Written, produced, directed, edited & composed by Charlie Chaplin, there are two versions of this film in existence but I prefer the silent one for the voice-over in the 1942 re-issue felt very intrusive to me. As for the film, it's an influential example of its genre & contains many moments that are now counted amongst the most memorable segments of silent cinema.Chaplin's ability to seamlessly infuse slapstick humour into drama continues to impress but the latter part doesn't carry enough weight in my opinion. The funny gags, however, are plenty & each one of them manages to leave its mark. And while Chaplin's work behind the camera is admirable, his performance in the starring role is even more infectious & impressive.On an overall scale, The Gold Rush isn't Charlie Chaplin's magnum opus, at least not in my eyes, but it remains an essential classic of its era that has continued to inspire countless films of its genre ever since. It's worth a shot for that ""dancing rolls"" sequence alone which is quite possibly Chaplin's single greatest on-screen moment plus the heavy dose of fun, entertainment & laughter it has in store guarantees an experience you hopefully won't regret.P.S. Choose the 1925 silent version over the 1942 re-issue! The latter, however, can be viewed as The Gold Rush with director's commentary."
xmissxskiz6,"Sep 14, 2010",N/A,"On the whole I thought this was a pretty funny movie for being a silent film, honestly I felt almost claustrophobic watching it because I wasn't able to understand what the actors were saying but then again it is a silent film. However the entrance titles definitely helped explain exactly what was going on in the film. Although i did find the story line rather hard to follow. With that said I was very impressed with how good the actors really were for this being such an early film, all the dancing was great and the outfits all seemed to go together pretty well as well as fit the time period. This was my first silent film and I enjoyed it it made me laugh; however, I must say that I'm extremely please with how far technology has come seeing as how now we are able to watch DVDs in color and hear sound and all the crazy lighting and camera effects we are now able to enjoy!"
rtherock915,"Sep 11, 2010",N/A,"Perhaps one of the finest films I've ever seen and one of Chaplins best. The film never lets up, either with moments of comedy or high drama. This is what Chaplin does best, one moment you'll be laughing at a brilliant piece of comedy and in the next scene he'll sucker punch you with some drama and leave you heartbroken only to have you laughing in the scene following. The only complaint I have about this film is the soundtrack to the version we watched in class. Granted it is a silent film but the music just seemed too overbearing and unnecessarily loud at times. When we first see Chaplin strolling through the wilderness and his cane falls through the snow there is an overly loud explosion of sound that really takes you out of the moment. Besides the music this is a very well crafted film and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who could sit through a silent film."
carvalheiro,"Nov 17, 2007",N/A,"In the dust of time from ""The gold rush"" (1925) directed by Charlie Chaplin, probably anybody still alive in Hollywood forgot the scene where the explorer is inside the hut near an abyss, from a valley around the mountains, during the eve of new year within bad weather and almost nothing warming the place, just when he is eating the threads of his shoes - perhaps giving the environment not so better than like boiled spaghetti - and the nails as chicken's bones. This is all about stock change in Chaplin's golden style, acting with a really experienced way of life inspired certainly in his own childhood, surely also by any other improvisation on the spot and probably, who knows, in an anodyne story of gold's searchers in California.He is in this extraordinary scene that took anybody who would be with this fate, if possible across the dream of that character on the silent screen in the aftermath and during his own sleeping pleasure, before wake up going out for the girl. Later, Chaplin already as a young and competitive millionaire, plays with fair play his old character as in the past, like a poor miner searching gold - when in situation during a last scene, at the liner on the deck, in a rivalry with his fat partner - in a mimic specially for the press and just before the encounter with the same woman, who was his own pleasure and now is already there too in the same place but without each other knowing it, for the moment. The purpose now of this movie it is enchanting our common lost memory of the past development and technology, that put still any society of settlers in turmoil when people is at the brink of a discovery so important as gold it was - as merchandising an equalizer for the grains of stone - as though like him one quickly should getting wealth at any price at the time. The ridiculousness of the main character, as imported tramp of this past world, if he exists as model still now is like less a pattern of unrest, because hungry animated by his mental comfort in dream but supposed as illness in the reality since then until to the present and past future. It was by no means Charlie your campaigner, conceived as a poor gentleman in this gamble of surviving and a rich tramp coming up in solidarity with his fellow citizens, even if he doesn't cope anymore at any price except with humor and cruelty for rivalries to return home alive.The scene where we saw the big bear coming up from the cavern, in the snowed and cold mountain during the bad weather, pursuing the little man and forcing this one slipping down the path on the border of the hill, as if he was escaping from the fire with gracious preciosity, it is the reverse of a human being in the role of an animal in its complicity for shared savagery in the unknown territory. There are many aspects of this movie which are still intriguing the hardiness from the construction of the plot, as though each time we saw it, it's another different movie as sensation and feeling of great emotion on the screen's pictures. That means probably its strength about suggestion in the viewer of today in it, by our collective memory naturally changes from the silent cinema to the sound and even if with its musicality additions over the sights, after a second version of the same movie with less length since then. Because also of many ingredients in it, such as the dream above the reality on the fiction there, it was too like the character of the fat gold prospector, who for a while forgot the location of the hut where it was his discovery and the only who knew the place in which it is, was Charlie."
jz3532,"Sep 29, 2015",N/A,"This is the 4th Charlie Chaplin film I have seen, and he continues to amaze me. All of the amazing things he was able to do long before modern technology blows my mind. Besides Modern Times (one of my all time favorites) I think this is his most impressive work.The Gold Rush follows the Tramp and his run ins with a convict, a successful prospector, and a beautiful woman during the search for gold in the Klondike gold rush. While this isn't my favorite film of his, I do think it is the best portrayal of the tramp I have yet to see. In other films, the tramp is just an average guy who falls victim to a domino effect of incredible coincidences, but in this film he has much more detailed emotions. You feel truly happy when he wins, and very sad when he doesn't. There is one scene in particular that was extremely emotional due to great performances from both Chaplin and the leading lady, Georgia Hale. This is stuff you don't normally get of of Chaplin films, and I loved it.Along with the acting, this film had great practical effects, especially for the 1920s, particularly the two main scenes in the cabin. Both of these scenes show the incredibly physical acting that Chaplin can do. I can't imagine how hard it must be to pretend a house is slanted, and he did it perfectly. I also believe this film originated the 'I'm hungry so I think my friend is food' gag, and it is the only film I've seen that has done it successfully.Overall this film had great performances, great practical effects, and that special Chaplin charm only he can achieve. This film is fantastic, and anyone who has enjoyed any of Charlie Chaplin's other films, should really check this one out.(This review was originally written on Movie Forums Sept. 29th 2015)"

Michael_Elliott,"Sep 6, 2018",N/A,"The Gold Rush (1925)**** (out of 4)Charles Chaplin wrote, produced, directed and stars in the lead role in this 1925 classic. In the film he plays a prospector who tries to cash in on the gold rush but finds one hardship after another.There are a great number of people who consider THE GOLD RUSH to be Chaplin's masterpiece but I will admit that I'm not one of them. There's no question that this is a great film and contains some of the greatest sequences in movie history but at the same time I think both CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES were the better films. With that said, it's says a lot about Chaplin that he managed to make three great films like the ones I've mentioned.If you're familiar with Chaplin then you know that the 1925 version was re-edited, cut down and had narration added to it. The film was restored as good as it could be but what we have today is still missing footage and it's doubtful that we'll ever see the original version. With that said, what remains still has some of the greatest moments in film history. There are countless great scenes here but my personal favorite has to be the sequence in the cabin where the hungry Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) sees Chaplin's character as a chicken.The way that sequence plays out and the timing is just flawless. You've also got a lot of other famous scenes including the roll dance and of course the cabin sliding off the side of the mountain. What has always impressed me about these scenes was the timing was so perfect on every little step. Needless to say, Chaplin, the performer, is wonderful here and his chemistry with Swain was perfect. The two of them make for a great team and there's no question that their magic is what makes the film."
Dethcharm,"Jun 2, 2023",N/A,"Director Charles Chaplin's THE GOLD RUSH is a superior example of silent film comedy. There are so many memorable sequences: The magnificent opening scene with the seemingly endless line of hopeful prospectors; the bear chase scene; the boot feast; the dinner roll dance; the teetering cabin; etcetera. Almost every scene is a classic. Mr. Chaplin truly was a genius in direction, writing, and, of course, acting / physical comedy. His zany scenes with Big Jim McKay (Mike Swain) are unforgettable comic gems.However, this movie isn't just funny, it's also full of poignancy that makes Mr. Chaplin's character more than a mere clown. The Lone Prospector's longing for Georgia (Georgia Hale) is heartfelt and effective. Georgia's remorse is realistic and painful. We empathize with, and feel for these people. This is a fast-moving, clever comedy, perfectly timed, with a satisfying finale.A genuine masterpiece..."

In ""The Gold Rush"" Our leading star Chaplin reprises his role as the tramp, and proceeds to partake in traditional slapstick humor and fall for another beautiful girl.

Many of the same story elements from ""The Circus"" are used here as well, and I tend to see where the ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all"" mentality comes from.

AlsExGal,"May 24, 2023",8/10,"... in which Chaplin tried to modernize The Gold Rush by taking out the title cards, adding narration which he himself did, changing the music, and deleting some scenes. It isn't bad since Chaplin himself redid it, but I just prefer the original.It isn't as funny as The Kid, not as heartbreaking as City Lights, and it doesn't have the social commentary of Modern Times. Instead it has a little bit of everything plus lots of atmosphere AND it takes Chaplin's Little Tramp out of some anonymous urban environment and lands him in a very specific place and time - the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s. I could feel the biting cold, the hunger, the loneliness. And in spite of this being set in the 1890s and seeming quite authentic to its setting, this film has a very modern feel to it, almost timeless.Chaplin's ""little fellow"" is introduced as a lone prospector. We never see him doing any prospecting, but it is later mentioned that he is not very successful at it and gives it up. The first part of the film has the little fellow waiting out a blizzard in a cabin with a wanted criminal in addition to a fellow prospector. The second part has Chaplin's character traveling to a Klondike boom town, watching a cabin for a more successful prospector, and falling in love with a dance hall girl who thinks his crush is just a big joke, at least at first.I don't think it was Chaplin's best silent film, but it does manage to do all aspects of the production very well and I can see why some people would judge it as his best. And if that was Chaplin in that chicken suit, all I can say is that he had the motions of a chicken down pat. To know what I'm talking about, watch and find out."
lukelandry1,"Apr 16, 2014",7/10,"I'm just an 18 year old dude in high school that was assigned this movie in a class at my school. When I first saw the genres of this movie I was not looking forward to it at all. It was the first silent movie I was seeing and also the oldest. It had originally seemed like everything I didn't look for in a ""good"" movie. At the conclusion of this movie I knew that my original thought process was entirely wrong. This movie has certainly changed my view on both silent and older films, especially on a comedic standpoint. There was so much about it that was appealing to the viewer. I recommend this movie to all looking to expand their film genres of interest."
didi-5,"Mar 30, 2005",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin's silent film (also re-released with a narration in the early 1940s) focuses, as usual, on the Little Tramp, and in this case, his attraction to a chorus girl (Georgia Hale). This is the one where he eats a boot, along with its laces, and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rolls.The role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin, Lita Grey, but her pregnancy ruled her out. Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions. Mack Swain appears as Big Jim, who shares a cabin with the Tramp, at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and gold-runners, as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero. As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time, as a sound film, it is fairly good."
planktonrules,"Apr 28, 2006",10/10,"I've seen both version of this film--the original silent version from 1925 and the re-release by Chaplin in the 1940s. The difference is that the re-release was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies. To do this, title cards were removed--having Chaplin narrate the film. In addition, Chaplin-created music (for the most part--some were classical pieces), sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer. I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVD--it has both plus excellent DVD extras. Otherwise, there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out there--many with terrible quality prints or music or both. The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find. The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the 1942 re-release.I use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film, though I might, in the future, use it for my Psychology classes as well (I teach both) because Chaplin's genius came from his obsessive-compulsive nature. The movie reportedly had 27 times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than 60 takes!!The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century. Along the way, he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb. Suffice to say, the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch (something not true of all full-length slapstick comedies--sometimes, their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to full-length).This is a gorgeous, well-executed piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac. The musical score (arranged by Chaplin), direction, acting and cinematography all are simply perfect--making this, in my opinion, the best full-length silent comedy ever made. This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton's films!"
Anonymous_Maxine,"May 15, 2001",10/10,"The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.Charlie and Big Jim are left alone and without food when Larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene), and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. There is, of course, the boot eating scene, memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness, but also because while making the film, Chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Another thing that was really well done was the special effects. I am still amazed every time I watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing Charlie hanging from the door of the cabin, which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. Also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene, the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film Shine, with Geoffrey Rush.There is also a very noteworthy love element of The Gold Rush, a part of the story that Chaplin generally has much success with in his films. Charlie's amorous interests in Georgia, a dance hall girl, leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls, probably the most famous scene in the film, which was also performed very well by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon. Charlie's relationship with Georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes, when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. Chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies, and The Gold Rush is one of the best of his full length features. A must see for any Chaplin fan, but The Gold Rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch."
Snow Leopard,"Aug 6, 2001",N/A,"This silent classic has many strong points - it has a lot of humor, interesting characters, a good story and good settings.  It's the kind of film that shows how much a master film-maker can communicate in a silent movie.  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion, but other than that it's a fine film.Chaplin himself plays the 'Lone Prospector', and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama.  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors' rickety cabins, plus some other good material.The version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin re-edited in the 1940's, adding his own narration and deleting the title cards, which gives it a slightly different feel.  (These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who aren't used to silent films.) You can tell from Chaplin's narration how fond he must have been of ""The Gold Rush"", and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it.  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless, but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art."
lee_eisenberg,"May 13, 2005",10/10,"The 1898 Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh, but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious. As an unnamed prospector, Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon. Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner, the dancing roles, and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff. His companion, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplin's character to be a chicken, and before long, a bear enters their cabin. In the midst of it all, the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia (Georgia Hale).A real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!"
PhilipJames1980,"Jun 7, 2004",10/10,"The Gold Rush is pure gold.  It was Charlie Chaplin's third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.This movie should be counted among Chaplin's best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I've also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy's immortal geniuses.Having first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college's silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen.Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven't even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that's also on the disc.The viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard.  On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!Also, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD.  But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.The first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies.And the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they've seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.I don't say this to sound pretentious.  I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted.  It's hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years.For example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin's first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama.  In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema's potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously.  Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.The joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy.  This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle's aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp's grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.One pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing.When Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm.  This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD.The second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn't sustain the entire film at the cabin.  Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film's third act.I don't want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.Mack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat.  Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid.  From what I've seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show.The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today's more sophisticated stories and special effects.  The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia's true feelings for the Tramp.But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.  What a shame.Rating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)"
ACitizenCalledKane,"Jan 4, 2005",10/10,"To see Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment. One cannot help but enjoy a film as well-done as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered, and I can see why. It is a masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like all great movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was a master of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a brisk pace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold. Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich. But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Of course, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the ego-maniacal ""lady killer."" All of this would be too much for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie, I am a fan of Charlie Chaplin's movies, but as objective as I can possibly be, this IS one of the great movies...Essential viewing!"
Xstal,"Sep 10, 2020",9/10,"Then came the dawn, and with it one of the standout scenes in any silent movie as the cabin teeters on the brink. There are so many elements in this film, elements that would be reused and recombined in various presentations over the years and on so many occasions - the gold standard.Endearing and adorable Charlie Chaplin - a genuinely pioneering prospector."
Jared G.,"Sep 8, 1999",7/10,"First of all, I fall into the Buster Keaton camp when it comes to silent comedy.  I'll take Keaton's stone face over Chaplin's sentimentality anyday. But this still is a very good film that anyone interested in film history ought to see. The boot eating scene and the potato dance are classic scenes."
faithnomore41291,"Sep 9, 2010",3/10,"This is the first silent film I have ever seen, so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound (other than the piano in the background) in a 90 minute movie. So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas across.I felt like they did some of same gags over and over again, like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove. It just got really old to me quickly. I don't know maybe because I'm from a different time period and way life but the film just didn't do anything for me. I didn't really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only 30 to 40 minutes long and nothing would have been lost."
tfrizzell,"Nov 7, 2003",N/A,"Charles Chaplin's ""The Gold Rush"" is arguably his finest film. He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich. What he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form of Georgia Hale) instead of money. In the end that may be all right with him. ""The Gold Rush"" shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer, writer and director he was. Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the 20th Century, Chaplin showed humanity, love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. The movie is exceptional in every way. Although I am not as well-versed with movies from the 1920s as I am with the decades following it, I would still probably call ""The Gold Rush"" the finest film of that 10-year period. Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today. 5 stars out of 5."
ga_cum197,"Feb 20, 2021",10/10,"Why something simple like this movie can make us feel so much?! I mean nowadays, movies are oversaturated with big budgets, visual effects, advertising campaigns but more than 50% of them can really deliver.
Charlie Chaplin's films are indeed true cinema. Given it was made in 1925, it's perfect to me. I have nothing to criticize or analyze it. Sometimes, we just forget what a film is supposed to be. It's supposed to make us feel, to make us acknowledge that it's a film, and to age well
There are some so called movies that I never consider them movies: Transformers 2,3,4,5. Twilight 2,3,4. Justice League....and so on.
Those just make me appreciate the classics even more."
Andreas-S,"Jan 29, 2004",10/10,"One of the best Chaplin movies, which means one of the best movies ever made. Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe' and `The Roll Dance'. Both the original version and the second release have their own charm."
ctrout,"Sep 27, 2005",10/10,"All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene that's very memorable because it's either very funny or very touching. In this film, it's one of the funny ones.You see, in this film, Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush. Along the way, he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them. Since they must try to survive in the cold weather, Chaplin decides to cook dinner. What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so great.It's not just that one joke though, there are tons of laughs in this great movie. So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies. You'll have a lot of fun watching it.As of now, this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that I've seen, but it probably won't be for long. I think he's one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon."
ffinixs,"Jun 15, 2005",10/10,"What a delightful film. I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches. Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic. I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff. This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them, like the eating shoe scene, fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun, and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene. When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments. I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Year's Eve knowing that he was stood-up. I genuinely felt for him. Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time. Brilliant."
lugonian,"Jan 26, 2002",10/10,"THE GOLD RUSH (United Artists, 1925), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin, may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era, but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations. So proud of his achievement, Chaplin reissued this silent film in 1942 with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself, eliminating the use of title cards. Then in the summer of 1971, THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting station's 13-week series of ""The Silent Years,"" as hosted by Orson Welles, from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William Perry.THE GOLD RUSH, which is set in the turn of the century, opens with The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) coming to Alaska. A snow storm drives him into the cabin of ""Black"" Lawson (Tom Murray), an outlaw. ""Big Jim"" McKay (Mack Swain), another prospector who has found gold on his claim, is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin. After much struggle, Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests. Stranded due to the heavy storm, Larson, finds himself chosen to go out for help. While out in the storm, he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him. He gets away by stealing their dog sled, but is later killed in an avalanche. Back to the cabin, Charlie and Larson, almost in near starvation, eventually make a meal out of a large bear. When the snow storm finally subsides, the two men go about their separate ways. Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia (Georgia Hale), a dance hall girl, causing jealousy from her suitor, Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite). As for Jim, he has forgotten where his gold claim is, and locates Charlie to help him find it, separating him from Georgia. The results that follow is classic Chaplin.Aside from a large list of supporting players, which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis, ""The Gold Rush"" contains many now classic comedy supplements, including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water, and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlie's encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim, in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement. There are tender moments, too, including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Year's Eve dinner, with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming. The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for them.With THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplin's most revived and discussed movie, one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed, including THE CIRCUS (1928), CITY LIGHTS (1931), MODERN TIMES (1936) and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940). Since the advent of home video in the early 1980s, THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores, ranging from the use of piano, organ or orchestra. There are even some editions that have no music track at all, along with some copies running different time lengths, and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout. The 1942 reissue, being a shorter print with Chaplin's narration, not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics, but can also be found on Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a 1921 comedy short, PAY DAY. Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection. But in spite of numerous editions, THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics (1997-2001) and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter 1942 reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score. While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector, avid lip readers will notice that he is called ""Charlie"" by his supporting players, especially by Georgia. (****)"
SMK-4,"Dec 16, 1998",7/10,"Chaplin was a great director in his time but many of his films have aged badly, simply because his sentimentality has completely gone out of fashion which puts a modern audience in a rather uneasy relationship to the Tramp character.  This problem also applies to this film which for a long time was regarded as one of the very best ever made.   It probably is no more.Despite of this, The Gold Rush is still very much enjoyable for its most famous moments, like Chaplin devouring a shoe (which was made out of licorice, I believe) or the potato-fork-dance."
llltdesq,"Nov 23, 2001",10/10,"If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability, t you a commend this film, as well as City Lights.  Modern Times isn't, strictly speaking, a silent film, although Chaplin had no dialogue there.  The Gold Rush, while not Chaplin's best film, does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits, it must be seen.  Excellent film.  1942 version redone by Chaplin is a bit better, but either will do.  Most highly recommended."
uhu,"Apr 17, 2002",3/10,"I cannot follow the praise of that movie by other viewers. Unlike his later works (such as The Circus, Modern Times, Citylights) the plot is thin and not well writen. The directing has many flaws, the scenes often ending abruptly with no clear link to the following. I love Chaplin films, but this one was disappointing."
