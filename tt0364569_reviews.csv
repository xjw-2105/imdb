Genevieve_X,"Jul 29, 2007",9/10,"I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don't ruin it by remaking it!!!)"
sqreader,"Jan 2, 2007",9/10,"I've scored this a 9 but I think I may have been a little harsh! I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!"
Xstal,"Jan 22, 2022",10/10,"Imagine what you'd do, when you wake from a bad dream, to find you're held by four square walls, for as long as someone deems, no idea why you're trapped, what you've done, why you're kidnapped, just a ceaseless line of dumplings going down your gyoza hatch. Now some fifteen years have passed, every question has been asked, and you're suddenly set free, can start your own avenging spree, before you do you need to feed, by eating something that's in need, so an octopus is ordered, and head first you cross the borders. But things aren't what they might seem, tied and tethered and undreamed, as the puppet master hovers, manipulates what you'll discover.Some films you cannot watch too often and this is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic brilliance ever created."
bur_007,"Dec 19, 2007",10/10,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance.I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time.My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!"
LeBaturalp,"Nov 15, 2016",10/10,"I don't know why but this movie will always be my favorite. Maybe because of amazing screenplays, very emotional soundtracks or feeling the high tension in every second. I watched so many movies which includes fight scenes. Some of them were good and some of them were bad but in Oldboy... I guess the best describing word is '' real'' about that fight scenes. Because I felt they were. And that scenes are covering about only 2% of the whole movie. Cinemography, perfect harmony of music and scenes, an amazing story and one of the great plot twists in movie history. I am struggling to find the correct words for this movie because this is a movie not a book. And I may easily say it is a masterpiece... I enjoyed the movie with every second of it. I wish there were more movies like Oldboy.But who knows? Maybe there will be..."
johnny-08,"Jul 22, 2007",10/10,"I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10"
max8791,"Apr 21, 2007",9/10,"I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange."
backnblack-06123,"Jul 31, 2021",6/10,"This isn't an enjoyable film to watch, shows a deprived human life, i like to be entertained when watching a film at least at some point.It isnt a great written story nor is the acting anything special."
tetsuoisleet,"Sep 6, 2007",10/10,"After going through the comments, i must say i'm impressed how many people out there don't have a slightest clue of beauty or intelligent screenplays. there are so many comments from people that totally disliked the movie. which is plain and simple not possible, if you got an open mind and a open heart (and are not drunk). I would compare it to chocolate. You may find it too sweet and prefer bitter chocolate. or you like white chocolate more. Or you got diabetes and can only sometimes eat one. But people that totally dislike chocolate scare me to death. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art-form it contains. Its everything in there. Its heartwarming , disgusting, intelligent, beautiful and lead with outstanding performance of any actor . You HAVE to like something, cause it wont get much better. Its chocolate. If you disliked the movie so much and on a constant basis, why even bother to write a comment? My guess is you just could not follow the movie at all. which is my only guess actually. well enough rambling.:::::::::: Bottom Line :::::::::If you call common sense, and a human heart your own and like ""challenging"" movies, go and see it NOW.(i recommend the original korean version with subs)I also recommend the pre- and sequel to this movie. (just browse Chan Wook Park) If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" is the best movie ever made, please do not even bother to watch Oldboy, and spare others your ""brilliant"" reviews."
lucas739,"Mar 17, 2007",9/10,"I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)"
LeroyBrown-2,"Feb 3, 2009",8/10,"I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration.The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note.Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film."
maciusp,"Feb 19, 2008",9/10,"The first time I watched ""Old-boy"", I was half-amazed, half-disgusted. I wasn't quite sure how to rate the movie in general. I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography & scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Old-boy"", and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.Knowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don't think there's 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.Don't be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don't be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It's worth it."
ryuakamrvengeance,"Mar 7, 2007",9/10,"Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.Many people accuse this film of being ""unrealistic"". These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.Although the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema."
asrafalli,"Jun 13, 2021",9/10,When I search google for the most confusing movie this movie was on the list so I gave it a shot didn't expect it to be this good the way it shows the story line it was amazing and creative. Loved every bit of it. Kind of disturbing but for those who like adult kind of movie it surely a must watch.
hanan-77633,"Sep 9, 2024",10/10,"Dae-su, a man who has been held captive for no apparent reason for 15 years, is suddenly released with all the things he would need to find the one who did this to him.This is easily the best revenge thriller I have ever seen. From its confusing start to its sick and ambiguous ending, this movie is a head-to-toe masterpiece. It keeps us hooked perfectly throughout the entire movie. A mind-blowing thriller with a touch of cat-and-mouse chasing throughout the movie.This movie is an original screenplay wonder that takes inspiration from the Greek play Oedipus Rex, written by Sophocles, and adapts it to the modern Korean backdrop. A perfect blend of revenge, suspense, trauma, tragedy and unclear ending makes it one of the greatest movies ever made in the World Cinema. Everything regarding this movie is peak perfection but, I think the most thing that makes this movie stand out is its masterful screenplay.Park Chan Sook, the man who directed this masterpiece, deserves all the praise and respect. He perfectly showed us this movie's dark and twisted world and made us indulge ourselves completely in it. The way he captured all the characters especially Dae Su and Woo Jin, that long action scene taken in a single cut, the excellent depiction of gore and violence, and leaving the ending in our thoughts, truly make him a brilliant director. I have seen some of his other movies as well but, this one is just PERFECT!All the actors did a wonderful job and they deserve their credit but Choi Min-Sink shook me to the core. His performance was something else. The character of Dae Su was already very complex but, Choi Min-Sink's top notch and real performance made us forget that he was acting. He became the Dae Su himself. His freaky yet painful laughing, the anger and rage he expressed through his eyes, the action and fights he performed and the climax where he totally stunned us with his acting, makes him truly stand out as one of the greatest Korean actors ever.As mentioned earlier, the movie is a head-to-toe perfection but, the thing that makes it a timeless classic and a cinematic milestone is its traumatizing and painful ending. It is so haunting and traumatizing that this movie stays in your mind for a long time. A revelation that turned our minds and hearts upside down. That moment was truly horrifying and unexpected. Also, a touch of ambiguity is added to the final scene, just before the last cut which keeps us wondering whether Dae Su has set free from all the pain or he has to live with that unspeakable pain till his death. That scene still freaks me out.To conclude my review, I want to say that this movie is a must-watch for all the cinephiles and those viewers who can withstand violence and disturbing themes because this movie can seriously mess your head up and you won't be able to wipe it out of your mind."
Thomas_Neville_Servo,"Sep 30, 2004",7/10,"After reading praise after praise about this film on the internet from mostly western viewers (such as the completely clueless Tarantino) and seeing as how it won a major prize at the most recent Cannes Film Festival, my expectations were naturally high when I finally got around to viewing it.I'm sorry to say that I do not share in their optimistic appraisal of this movie.After being imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons by an unknown person/persons, Daesu (Min-sik Choi) is naturally a bit upset and is dying to figure out who imprisoned him and why. Borrowing a page from M. Night Shyamalan's guide to movie surprises, writer/director Chan-wook Park (along with 3 other writers) attempts to craft a whodunnit that will keep you guessing and interested until the very end. Well, they only half succeed. I'll admit that I'm normally slow when it comes to movie surprises, but this one jumps out at you as soon as Daesu gets out of prison. It couldn't be more obvious unless the director was sitting next to you whispering it into your ear. From that point on, the movie really begins to drag as we watch Daesu meander from one place to the next in an unfocused attempt to find his enemy and discover the reason behind his imprisonment. Perhaps the main problem with the film is the severe lack of information given to both Daesu and the viewer. Rather than finding out the real truth on his own, he is essentially told everything in the end thanks to a well choreographed monologue. This is not a ""detective""-style story that gives you clues along the way. Some secrets and identities are revealed much too early, leaving only the unknown reason for Daesu's imprisonment the movie's last remaining attempt to keep the viewer interested. When we finally learn of the reason, it's a total letdown and should leave any experienced movie watcher either scratching their heads in total disbelief that someone actually considered this as a basis for a film or make you angry enough to stop the movie right then and there. With the movie's undeniably gritty sense of style and beautiful classical score, this should have been mind blowing. But it's not. It's pathetic. It's obvious the filmmakers really didn't know how to craft a film of this caliber, so they fall back on the ""H"" word (you'll catch the ""H"" word when you hear it in the film) to solve ALL of their screen writing problems.Thankfully the movie does have some positive aspects. The lighting and color scheme really reflect the inner conflicts within Daesu. This is a dark film, and it shows. The cinematography is inventive and vibrant with clever scene transitions and unique movements. The aforementioned score couldn't be better. It's a great mix of classical pieces, original music inspired by classical pieces, and moments of pseudo techno/industrial music, and it certainly does a great job of infusing the viewer with a sense of doubt and depression. Min-sik Choi gives an extremely admirable performance as the mentally conflicted Daesu and handles all kinds of scenes from action to romance with a great sense of confusion and surprise. Finally the relationship between Daesu and the mysterious Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) is really quite touching, allowing for some nice dramatic moments.That being said, it's ashame that the film's story couldn't match its style.Chan-wook Park has directed some of Korea's best and most memorable films in recent memory, such as JSA and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, but Old Boy is simply a semi-interesting film. In the realm of revenge flicks, this is perhaps one of the more ambitious (which is definitely a good quality) films out there, but ambition can only get you so far, and Chan-wook Park just can't pull it off. Worth a look for film fans, but it's just not remarkable enough to be recognized on a global scale. Beware before you buy, for you could end up being sorely disappointed as well. 6/10"
gdmvy,"Aug 29, 2007",10/10,"Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off, but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.Without giving anything away, once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene, but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him. He doesn't question it either.To me this was one of the greatest depictions of Oedipus or other Greek characters I've seen this decade in a movie. Nothing is new. If you liked ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Blue Velvet."" Consider this one."
romeovillarreal,"Aug 1, 2018",10/10,"I know my title might sound a little dramatic but it is true. This was one of the first Korean movie's I had ever seen and after that I was hooked. The story is original and beautifully shot. I never understand why people write a synopsis in a review. You can watch the trailer or read what IMDB already has under description. Moving along the movie is great. Good story, drama, fights, and twists. It's on Netflix so catch it while you still can. Stay away from the atrocious American remake. That movie was garbage and a mockery of this Korean classic. Hope this review helps."
jacktalking,"Aug 27, 2009",10/10,"From the ""Vengeance"" trilogy by Pak Chan-wook, Oldboy is probably the best, followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Simple story, ""low budget"" and actors you already know from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Although I am a fan of Korean movies, when I've heard about this movie and it's plot for the first time, I thought ""oh my god, another sponsored-by-tomato-factory movie"". I watched it for the first time two years after it was released. And to be honest, I was surprised. Since then, I watched this movie more than ten times and I still find it interesting. To me, Oldboy the best Korean movie ever made. Maybe best Asian movie in the last 20 years.I recommend you to watch this, along with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. You'll be also surprised to find the same actors.10/10"
JagsFanJay,"Aug 15, 2007",10/10,"In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers. This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming.It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis. If you want to stay true to the Asian vision, I even think Jackie Chan could be a candidate."
grdontom,"Jul 27, 2009",10/10,"Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.The plot itself is as follows. The protagonist Oh Dae-Su is one day captured and finds himself locked up in a makeshift prison. After a brief spell of anger and spewing hatred for his captors, he resigns himself to his fate, and after 15 years of shadow boxing and suicide attempts he wakes up from a gas induced coma on top of a tower block where he was initially seized. He then proceeds to try and find out who did this and why, and the film basically charts this quest.The first word that springs to mind when thinking about this film has to be graphic. There are certain scenes which will make those of nervous disposition recoil until they are firmly wedged between the back and seat of their sofa, and they are likely to spend much of the film there as violence is frequent. In most of the extreme cases it is simply the implication of violence and the viewer's imagination when left to its own devices like this will cause its own disgust. This hurdle was a huge thing problem for my dad, who considered some of the violence to be gratuitous, which I can somewhat agree with, although certain scenes are completely integral to the plot. The best way I can justify these scenes is simple. It is all about sending a message, and these do just that. If you can cope with this then you will break down the initial barrier the film leaves lying in the way of your enjoyment.Another barrier will be the massive culture shock experienced when viewing the film. This is a Korean language film adapted from a Japanese animé series, so there are obviously large cultural differences to the western world. Some of the images used will require quite some thought to fully understand, and the script on translation does lose some of its flow, as any animé or graphic novel fans will associate with. For my father, this made it hard for him to settle into the flow of the film, and I can identify with this slightly from my early days of watching animé.Many of the themes you will pick up on and the method of direction is very synonymous with Quentin Tarantino. There are devices used in this film which have obviously taken inspiration from Tarantino's works, in particular the Pulp Fiction- esquire use of camera angles, and the famous dotted line sequence. However, Tarantino is himself a huge fan of Old Boy, being its main advocate to win the 2003 Palme d'Or (where it eventually lost out to Fahrenheit 9/11) and has stated Park Chan-Wook as an influence for his directing style on the Kill Bill series, as well as on his later grindhouse works Death Proof and Planet Terror. Chan-Wook takes on a policy of ""trust the director"", and leaves many questions throughout the film which gives it a somewhat disorientating feel at times. This method of directing can seem quite inaccessible, however all loose ends are tied up very satisfactorily in the enthralling and shocking climax. This is an ending to rival the classic Kaiser Sozé twist in the tail of The Usual Suspects.What really separated and elevates Chan-Wook's work above and beyond Tarantino's however is very simple. Much of Tarantino's work is undertaken as an exercise in direction and film making, and therefore his work can therefore feel shallow. Old Boy however is a film which assesses the deepest corners of the human heart. The middle of three films which make up Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy it is undoubtedly the masterpiece, with a more powerful message than Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. This film has power because of the depths to which it explores the flaws and forces the human heart possesses, stronger and more destructive than any wisdom can overcome. The performances of the main cast and most importantly the director to send this message to the viewer leave this film as about as close to perfection as I can see any film getting."
chris-2512,"Aug 2, 2005",6/10,"I saw Old Boy on a grey market DVD about half a year ago and fell asleep during the first twenty minutes. Since then, my friends have literally been begging me to see it to the end, so this Saturday I watched it on the big screen where I had no chance of escape.Boy was that a mistake. Old Boy is by turns idiotic, horrendous and senselessly violent. It lacks the glee of the most basic revenge film. Even Kill Squad did it better.Old Boy simply has no point to speak of. My question is: How did the director and scriptwriter screw up a revenge thriller?Old Boy is very reminiscent of Takashi Miike's far superior Ichi the Killer. The difference between Ichi and Old Boy is one of extremes. Both films revolve around extracting brutal revenge. In this film, the eponymous hero seeks vengeance for fifteen years of imprisonment in a hotel room. In Ichi, Kakihari, a Yakuza enforcer, must track down his kidnapped Boss who may or may not be dead. Both Kakihari and Old Boy use torture to achieve their ends, but in Ichi the violence is committed by such dedicated sadists that it transcends itself and becomes Dionysian. Thusly, Ichi is far more violent than Old Boy, but far more aware. In Old Boy, the violence does nothing but communicate itself as alternately grotesque and depressing.The end of this film is so unbelievable that it made me wonder why they didn't just let a seven year old rewrite it. It was that bad. If you thought the end of Ichi was head-scratching, wait until you see this one. You will feel so betrayed by Old Boy's cop-out you may never want to see another South Korean film again.I think the ridiculous praise this film received (Ebert and Tarantino included) happened because NO ONE was comfortable recommending Ichi. Additionally, Ichi was not distributed theatrically in Ontario (Where I live) and was for a period, even banned.Ichi is a more violent, more difficult film, but it's rewards are far greater than this misdirected piece of trash. How this film ended up at Cannes is beyond me. I think it was because of the reputation of Park Chan's much better ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"".Most likely, nothing I'm going to write here is going to prevent the curious from seeing this film. But if you feel like your time was wasted, don't tell me I didn't warn you."
kp-9mm,"Jun 20, 2005",6/10,"This film is not bad, but does it deserve to be rated as one of the best films of all times? I think not. When rating a film the most important thing should be, what is the film giving the audience and what is the message that the director is pushing across. In this film the message is not much smarter than your average horror flick, and the only feeling you have after seeing it is disgust. That's not really a bad thing, if it has direction. In films like Seven there is and it can be summed up really easy in the last sentences from Morgan Freeman. ""The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the last part."" Because Oldboy lacks a message like this the whole film becomes an empty vessel.That being say, it might be one of the best empty vessels created. The photography is stunning, the editing is clever and the acting is at most parts really good. The story is smart, but becomes a little to smart at times. It's trying too much to live up to films like Memento, Seven or even The Sixth Sense where everything is revealed in the end. First of all I wasn't that surprised, but the worst part was that I really didn't care.To sum it up: good film, but not even close of being one of the 1000 best films in history."
smitstachowski,"Apr 20, 2007",8/10,"If you look at the awards this title has won, you will see that critics worldwide rated the film very highly when it came out. The story is one that has already been remade by the Americans - a man is imprisoned for 15 years by someone he has never seen, released - given a cellphone and five days to find out why he was imprisoned and identify his captor. Harrowing, excellent acting with the true horror not coming from guns but from a shocking personal realisation at the end of the film. Sadly, as is always the case after a mass murder, the media and the public are looking for an easy solution as to why Cho Seung-Hui murdered American students on a rampage. He was pictured in poses which the press tagged as those struck in OLDBOY but these are used by any soldier, terrorist or nutter. I'm sorry this film has borne the brunt of the backlash - Cho Seung-Hui was mentally ill - this film did not cause him to go mad, he was sick. Back to the movie, this will stick with viewers after watching. I'm glad to have a DVD copy of it."
coldwaterpdh,"Feb 20, 2008",10/10,"The first time I saw ""Oldboy"" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost cliché. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of ""Oldboy"" are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like ""Oldboy"" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.'10 out of 10, kids."
pulpficat,"Jan 22, 2024",8/10,"Enter the labyrinth of vengeance and psychological intricacy in Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, a film that unfurls like a dark tapestry of torment and retribution. Oldboy is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving a narrative that seamlessly blends elements of mystery, suspense, and psychological horror. The film's visual language creates an atmospheric tension that lingers long after the credits roll. The cinematography is both visceral and poetic, reflecting the duality of the human experience.As a narrative puzzle unfolds, the film explores the fragility of memory, the weight of guilt, and the consequences of revenge. The labyrinthine plot is fraught with unexpected twists that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's a story that challenges perceptions, leaving us to question the boundaries of morality and the true cost of justice. The film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of human nature, confronting the audience with uncomfortable truths that linger in the shadows.From the very first frame, Oldboy plunges its audience into a labyrinthine narrative, where the enigmatic Oh Dae-su, portrayed with raw intensity by Choi Min-sik, finds himself inexplicably imprisoned for 15 years, his only company the haunting memories of an unknown tormentor. Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Dae-su is a tour de force, capturing the relentless determination and psychological toll of a man on a quest for answers. The viewer is held captive by the film's intricate web of suspense, and just when it seems the story's crescendo has been reached, enters the long corridor scene, a feat of cinematic audacity that raises the bar for choreography, cinematography and narrative integration.The corridor fight, which unfolds as a single, unbroken take, is a symphony of brutality choreographed with a rhythmic cadence that juxtaposes grace and violence. As Oh Dae-su unleashes his pent-up fury upon a relentless wave of adversaries, the camera follows his every move with a hypnotic fluidity, transcending the boundaries of conventional filmmaking. This unrelenting shot, lasting a staggering four minutes, immerses the audience into the visceral essence of the struggle, blurring the line between spectator and participant. What sets this scene apart is not merely its technical bravado, but its narrative significance. The corridor, symbolizing the tortuous path of vengeance and redemption, becomes a canvas on which Oh Dae-su's metamorphosis is painted. Each blow and parry is not just physical combat, but a psychological confrontation, a battle against his own demons. Park Chan-wook ingeniously melds form and content, using the corridor as a physical and metaphorical arena for Oh Dae-su's existential ordeal.In an era where filmic excellence often yields to the allure of CGI and contrived action, Oldboy stands as a beacon of authenticity. Its corridor scene, devoid of visual trickery, exalts the art of filmmaking itself, reminding us of the potential for innovation within the boundaries of human creativity.In the Korean cinematic history, Oldboy is more than a fleeting spectacle-they are a magnum opus that reaffirms the power of storytelling, the magic of the moving image, and the unbounded capabilities of a dedicated creative team. As the corridor becomes a stage for Oh Dae-su's reckoning, it simultaneously becomes a stage for cinema's triumph.The thematic exploration of isolation, manipulation, and the cyclical nature of violence adds layers to the film's narrative. Odboy is a testament to the enduring impact of trauma, revealing how the past, once buried, can resurface to exact a devastating toll on the present. It's a cinematic enigma, a psychological thriller that leaves an indelible mark on the psyche. Park Chan-wook's masterful direction, combined with stellar performances, creates an immersive experience that resonates with the complexities of the human condition."
Scorsese_Eyebrows,"Jul 22, 2009",10/10,"Oldboy is the kind of film that the cinema was invented for. It doesn't patronise or insult it's audience, it keeps the audience on their toes, constantly engaged in suspense, drama and mystery. Watching this film is an emotional roller-coaster. The cinematography is dark, yet breathtaking, the music accompanies all of the drama and action beautiful, in an almost operatic sense. It's graphically violent, but not gratuitously so, the acting is first rate and the plot is intricate, intelligent, filled to the brim with many philosophical and human ideas.It's perfect for multiple viewings, it's a good laugh to watch with your mates, it was desired for the really big screen and the experience of watching OldBoy is unforgettable, right up until the very end. Genre defining, it is Kafka-esquire, it's Hitchcockian, Polaski-esquire and plays out like a modern day Dumas novel, all in one. FIRST RATE. loved it, it is a film that can be classified as just pure cinema."
marco_spinelli555,"Mar 2, 2005",7/10,"I feel people somehow invariably overreact when it comes to this movie. Come on guys, it's just a movie, like it or leave it. It's not necessarily a 10 but neither does it deserve a 1. (For what it's worth, I gave it a 7.) How would I explain this split opinion? It depends very much on what one expects from it, as well as on the overreaction of some viewers who feel, perhaps rightly so, that the movie is way overrated on IMDb, so they feel like they have to overreact the other way, giving it a 1, while this movie is most certainly deserving of much more than 1 !What would be my unadulterated view on the movie itself? It's not as bad as some posters write. At least one should acknowledge some very good camera-work and naturalist honesty in projecting a certain darkness that resides at the bottom of human souls. The main actor does a good job in most of the movie, I think, but the script gives him no chance but to overdo things toward the end, in hysterical tones which can easily grate on the educated movie lover's nerves.On the other hand, I cannot understand for the life of me how such a movie made it so high on the IMDb rating system. It's really unbelievable how that could happen. Some viewers all over the world liked the movie but that still does not explain it. Perhaps the pride of some viewers couched in the same culture made them vote en masse with automatic 10's? Hard to tell.Back to the movie now. I would say that within its own rather cheap genre (""B"" movie), Oldboy is an exceptional production, more attentively scripted, shot and acted than most. There is occasionally some really memorable touch in there, the trace of the hand of a professional (even if you may find the general tone of the movie gross and overboard). On the other hand, compared with most other movies that share comparable ratings, Oldboy seems to be woefully lacking in both substantial and stylistic qualities that would qualify it for such an unlikely honor. There are literally hundreds of 7 to 8 rated movies which are undoubtedly better than this one.If you enjoy this type of ""B"" (from bloody but not only (-:) revenge movie _anyway_ (the ""country relative"" of the ""film noir"" genre), Oldboy will probably not disappoint you. If you expect to watch some kind of unqualified masterpiece, and you have the cinematic culture to understand what that really means, you might (and, I repeat, might) ask for your money back in anger. I have no way of knowing that for sure."
akain8033,"Nov 18, 2007",9/10,"This is an amazing film. I have to say though, if you are American and don't speak Korean, than it is crucial that you watch this with someone who is. I know I wouldn't have been able to understand a lot of the subtleties if it wasn't for my friend having to pause the movie occasionally to tell me what just happened. This is a very disturbing film at times and I probably cringed enough for my liking. I'd have to say that its strongest points were the acting and the script. Every character was utterly believable. Especially the main character, Oh Deseau. I have rarely sympathized for a character in a movie as much as I did for him. 15 years? That's ridiculous. As far as the script goes...wow. It's probably one of the best scripts ever written in the history of film. And the ending is just too much. If you had to compare it to anything else I'd say that it's a lot like Audition meets Seven. I highly recommend this film to anyone with a strong stomach who loves thrillers and surprises."
M242,"Sep 14, 2004",7/10,"I liked it and agree w/ everyone who says that it is a beautiful film to look at and yes, it does dig its hooks into you at the beginning and yes, it's superbly executed and yes, the acting is very good but when the movie tries to pay itself back in the end, I couldn't help but feel completely uninterested. Maybe it was the fact that movie seemed way cooler than the audience and made no bones of hiding this arrogance. Maybe it was just the fact that it knew it had a secret to tell and when it finally told you - you were left saying, ""that's it?!"".Maybe I'm too desensitized to all of this but honestly, if you're going to pay off, pay off big. Especially if you've kept me hanging on for that long."
mindtimey,"Jan 30, 2005",10/10,"I would not talk about anything on the plot, acting, whatever. It is a kind of shock to you, and was a shock to me. If you need something very different, but still very interesting, this is for you. I can see some flaws. But would not mention it. I don't want to ruin the goodness by those flaws. The positive aspects were so impressive that I don't want to lose any of them. This is the kind of movie that you feel it is different from any other movie. (Even though it is not that different in small parts.) Once you see it, I can't guarantee you feel good as in usual dramas. Nor will you feel relieved as in horror/thriller. The feeling is very complex. I couldn't even say what the movie was intending to say. Maybe it can be a flaw. But can't it be another goodness?"

samtebbatt,"Jan 21, 2008",9/10,"I'm sorry, I can't understand why some of the users on this site shun Oldboy so much.I think this is a brilliant film, and yes it does have artistic and avant garde tendencies. If its not your thing, don't watch it.I, however, think it is a masterpiece. The levels of engagement that the actors are in to create the story is brilliant. People are simply overlooking the fact that incest is a huge tragic flaw. there are brilliant, slightly surreal moments, and I think this is what makes the film.The camera work is something creative, and has moments of paying homage to the comic, and other films.I love it so much so, that I have taken the story into physical theatre and created something new. I have done this to pay tribute to such a phenomenal film.Brilliant, no questions asked..."
imdb-19548,"Oct 27, 2007",10/10,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film as much as this one.The key premise is original, which is rare enough by itself, and when you add to that some good writing you get a great film.There are some deliberately hammed up comic moments to lighten the mostly very dark mood of the film and these are genuinely very funny.The action is often over the top, but not in a gory way, and it is interesting to watch the story unfold with the viewer having no more idea of what is happening and why than the protagonist.The pace is quick enough that you never get bored and the ending is dark and nasty and twisted and surprising.There is nothing bad I can say about the film."
KineticSeoul,"Oct 3, 2009",9/10,"I will start out by saying that Chan-wook Park is a film making genius, maybe Quentin Tarantino of Korea. The plot was original and the character development and cinematography was really well done. This is a revenge story that grips you from beginning to end, especially at the end. This movie is a must see, even if you have a weak stomach go watch it anyways, cause there will be those ""thats f***** up"" moments, the fight scenes are few but realistic. I am not going to ruin anything about this movie or give away the pot, all I can say is just watch the damn movie. Korean film making at it's best.9.2/10"

somf,"Sep 8, 2005",6/10,"Nothing about this film rang true. I've enjoyed a lot of Asian cinema, but perhaps I have just no understanding of the Korean culture. Little that the characters did during the entire film made much sense. There were some wonderful individual scenes and great camera-work, but that didn't make up for a lot of things in the film that appeared for lack of a better word ""lame"". An example is when Oldboy holds off a gang of thugs with a hammer. It didn't work as ""comic book"" action nor as a realistic fight. Another example is the ant thing. Especially the giant ant on the subway. ""Hey, this would look arty"" Really disagree with those that loved this film. It has its merits. I wasn't fooled by the ending twist. Some disgusting scenes that made little sense. Just overall forgettable. I must admit though, I'm really curious how the American remake will turn out."

irawanrizki1808,"Feb 19, 2014",10/10,"At first I used to be have this personal negative sentiment about Korean movie. Korean people tends to make everything over-dramatic (my experience watching FLU which is so painful to watch). And then the sentiment is slightly lowered when I finished this movie.Briefly, this is a story about a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for almost 15 years without any explanation. Suddenly he is released only to find note given by the kidnapper which asking him to find the answer who he/she is, why the reason he was imprisoned and get revenge.A journey to find the answer is begin.Right from the opening scene until the very last scene, there are no room for me to breath. The cinematography is so stylish and the acting was top-notch performance. The story development is well-thought and the twist is brilliant, relentless and merciless. The last 15 minutes is my favorite part in this movie. It satisfies my curiousness. By the end credit rolls you will find yourself speechless by how disturbing yet gorgeous the movie was and how the director intentionally leaving us some unanswered questions.My only concern is that I find some of the last part a bit too cliché and sentimental for my taste but it doesn't material.This is Park Chan-Wook's masterpiece and one of the best Korean movie ever made. You will find many elements like gore, thriller, drama, action blends into one perfectly mixed element.And just like any other revenge themed movie, the same question will arise:""When you had your revenge well, what's left for you?"""
KScythe,"Oct 20, 2015",10/10,"This was the movie that got me into Korean cinema. This was in my opinion the best movie from Park-Chan Woo's ""Vengeance Trilogy"" and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made. Around 7 years ago, I have been a huge fan of extreme cinema and I heard about Oldboy from one of my friends. When I actually sat down to watch it, I was completely blown away. This was not like any movie I have ever seen before. The storyline, cinematography, acting and soundtrack have exceeded far beyond my expectations.The story follows a man named Oh Dae-su, who has been held captive in a cell of what seems to be a hotel room for 15 years. After being released, he tries to find his captor, find out his motives, and achieve ultimate vengeance.The storyline seems simple enough, but the movie blows up in the faces of the audience with all kinds of unexpected plot twists. Not only that, but the story involves the audience with the characters in the movie by including very good character development and acting.I could go on and on about this film, but the fact is that it's terrific and worth checking out. It will leave many with lots to talk about after finishing it."

dosyasoda,"Sep 10, 2022",10/10,"How often do you see a movie that makes you think, ""What did I see? I don't know, but it's genius"". That's exactly what you think after watching ""Oldboy"", 2003, directed by Park Chang Wook. Very mixed feelings of disgust and delight overtake the viewer as soon as he reveals the final twist of the plot.In a nutshell, the plot tells the story of an ordinary businessman, Oh Dae-su, who unexpectedly disappears for 15 years. And where he was and who stole him is to be found out over the course of the film.""Oldboy"" comes across exactly as a psychological drama, pushing the feelings and raising reasonable philosophical questions.The main character does not show emotion on his face, but there is so much pain in his eyes, thanks to the acting of Choi Min-sik. The viewer feels sorry for Oh Dae-su and wants to empathize with him, but judging his behavior soberly, it's the opposite. The antagonist Lee Woo Jin played by Yoo Ji Tae also proves to be more than just a faceless villain, the viewer finds out how smart he is and how justified his actions are. So well-reasoned, in fact, that you don't realize whose side you're on.The main problem with the movie is the cast. Other than Oh Dae-su and Lee Woo Jin, the characters are not memorable, seeming faceless. After watching it, it's hard to remember a single minor character who was interesting.The film raises questions about the viewer's personal life stance. What is love? Platonically, relationally, sexually? Is there a difference? What does it mean to get revenge? At what point does revenge end? And what is the difference between a man and an animal?You won't find the answers to these questions in the film, but it will make you think for a long time, the hyperbolized details of the scenes, the close-ups, the cruelty. All of this can be justified by the desire to create an atmosphere of discomfort, because it's the only way you can feel at least a little bit of what Oh Dae-su felt.It's hard. Very hard to watch, but it doesn't make it any less interesting. Separately, I would like to highlight the camerawork. A lot of angles, camera moves, theatrical scenes, and a lot more. All of these visuals serve their purpose. The fight scene in the hallway is considered iconic for a reason. The entire fight is worked out to the smallest detail."
mistoppi,"Feb 20, 2016",8/10,"To be hones I'm in a shock right now.The story of Oldboy is absolutely horrible. And no, I don't mean it's written badly, I mean the story is so horrifying that after I was done I just had to sit and stare the screen for a while. The only thought in my head is: ""What the hell did I just see?"" This is the beauty of movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you: Oldboy, Primal Fear, Fight Club... I'm sure there are many more, but just making a list would be lazy. The plot twist in Primal Fear is just surprising. It's clever, but the thing is, it's not that bad. while Oldboy... That plot twist is absolutely shocking. And the story is well written even when you don't count the plot twist. The main character's narration gives a lot more interest to the story. The mystery is intriguing, and the writers have a way of keeping the viewer invested in the story. Even when you don't really like Oh Dae-Su, you still want to know why. And even Oh Dae-Su is not really a likable character, you still wonder if he deserved that. That would be an interesting philosophical debate.There are a few group fight scenes in this film, and they are excellent. They are well coordinated and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as fight scenes are) to watch. The visual side of Oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs to. There were few gore-y scenes, yet nothing too horrifying was shown, so something was left to imagination. Still those scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.Oldboy is a very well made movie. It's shocking, and I'm not sure how good it is when you watch it a second time, but at least after this first time I am astonished - and shocked. I'd love to recommend this movie but I don't know how risky that would be."

chiragrathod09,"Apr 29, 2023",10/10,"""Oldboy,"" directed by Park Chan-wook, is an extraordinary South Korean thriller that leaves viewers both enthralled and disturbed.The plot centers on Oh Dae-su, a seemingly ordinary man played brilliantly by Choi Min-sik, who is inexplicably imprisoned in a small, windowless room for 15 years. As he is released without explanation, he embarks on a relentless quest to uncover the identity of his captor and the motivations behind his haunting imprisonment. As Dae-su's journey unfolds, it transforms from mere revenge into a dark exploration of the human condition, identity, and the consequences of one's actions.One of the most striking aspects of ""Oldboy"" is its intricate narrative structure. Park Chan-wook crafts a suspenseful tale filled with unexpected twists and moral complexities that challenge traditional notions of justice. The film's pacing is gripping, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as secrets unravel and the stakes rise. The film culminates in a shocking climax that forces audiences to reflect on the nature of revenge and its unbearable costs.Choi Min-sik's performance is nothing short of exceptional. He embodies the anguish and rage of Dae-su with a raw intensity that remains unforgettable. His transformation from a passive victim to an agent of vengeance is both compelling and haunting. Supporting performances by Yoo Ji-tae, who plays the enigmatic antagonist, and Kang Hye-jeong, who portrays a pivotal character in Dae-su's journey, add further depth to the film's emotional landscape.Visually, ""Oldboy"" is a feast for the senses. Park's direction is complemented by captivating cinematography that captures both the bleakness of Dae-su's imprisonment and the vibrant yet dark world outside. The film is peppered with striking imagery, including the iconic hallway fight scene shot in a single continuous take-an exhilarating blend of choreography and cinematographic expertise. Furthermore, the haunting score by composer Jeong Jong-hyeon perfectly complements the film's tone, amplifying the viewer's emotional experience.However, it's essential to note that ""Oldboy"" does not shy away from graphic violence and disturbing themes, which may be unsettling for some viewers. Yet those willing to confront its darker elements will find a rich tapestry of storytelling that transcends typical genre conventions.Oldboy"" is not without its controversies, as it delves into graphic violence and disturbing themes that may not be suitable for all viewers. However, those who appreciate bold storytelling and complex character arcs will find it to be a remarkable and thought-provoking film.In conclusion, ""Oldboy"" is a cinematic masterpiece that challenges and captivates its audience. With its blend of psychological depth, stunning visuals, and a haunting narrative, it remains a cornerstone of modern cinema and a vital part of the conversation around the portrayal of revenge on screen. Park Chan-wook's film is not merely a movie; it is an experience that lingers long after the credits roll."
taalan,"Feb 26, 2007",10/10,"Let me just say first and foremost, that anyone who cannot stand heavy handed violence, language or sex should probably miss this film... for the rest of us, this film has it all! One of the most incredible performances ever by Choi (the acting all around is spectacular, but he stands out above the rest), great directing, the corridor scene is just pure glee, one of the most ingenious plots and story line twists of all time, and believe it or not, the movie is extremely funny in some parts (the whole, ""now let me tell you my story"" part is hilarious, just to name one example). However what really shows the quality of OldBoy is that it's not just a excellent conglomerate of all those things that make a movie good, it was how it affected you. OldBoy is a extremely deep and psychological movie on the level as well as the carnal level, and it gets better every time you see it. If you think you can handle the content, and don't mind subtitles, then this film is a absolute must see. Overall, this is quite possibly the best revenge drama of all time."

Even people who really didn't like the movie, loved the fight scene in the middle, it has comedy, extreme violence and some good old fighting.This movie is in my top 5 favorites of all time and the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because after watching it as many times as I have some scenes get a bit boring.This movie has it all, plot twists that would make M. Night Shyamalan confused, action that would make john woo proud, sex scene's that are worthy to be in a porn, and action that should've gotten an Oscar.If you haven't seen it yet, do so now. If you've seen it but didn't get it watch it again. And if you're like me and love it, just watch it for the fun of it again."
igormontenegro,"Sep 4, 2018",10/10,I know nothing about this movie before watching it. Now I can tell that this is one of the best movies ever.
TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Feb 17, 2012",10/10,"I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's ""Oldboy"" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as ""Mr. Park"", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie!This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't.""Oldboy"" is a 10 out of 10. It is as close to perfection as a film can get."
vortexrider,"Jan 20, 2007",6/10,"I would say that although this film does have its good moments, its not as good as many say it is. First half of the film is pretty intriguing and mysterious. You can't help but wonder what you would do in the situation of a man who has been locked up in a room for unknown to him reasons for fifteen years.The film goes downhill after Oh Dae Su gets out of the prison and starts seeking revenge. The plot has been made way more complicated than it had to be. What I found most annoying is various sentimental scenes where a piano is playing and we supposedly get to see someone's emotions or their ""softer side"" . I did not like it because I thought it took away from the continuity of the movie and its straightforwardness.When I said the plot is too complicated I meant not only that but also that its a very unrealistic plot in which characters do not act the way, I think, people would act in real life. Its just dumb sometimes.There is also a pretty tasteless sex scene that is just painful to look at.I feel like this movie is intentionally glamorized by the director and does not reflect real human emotions. I feel like he was copying Fight Club or similar movies made in the west."
martinwOO7,"Apr 16, 2022",7/10,The film is slow to begin with and has some very hammy acting and fight scenes but it is worth seeing it though to the second half when it comes alive and there is a very big surprise awaiting you.
mannyg93,"Jul 31, 2013",9/10,"Oldboy was a fantastic film which had an unexpected ending. It's one of those films where you purely and genuinely feel sorry for the main characters. The execution of the film as whole was genius and very well done.Character development was really well done and it wasn't hard to follow the storyline at any point of the film. The flashback scenes were done really well as well, and the black & white shading added nice tone to the scenes.Highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Tarantino pictures or anything left-of- field!!"
bowmanblue,"Aug 4, 2015",8/10,"I recently saw another Korean film 'I Saw the Devil' and, in light of the fact that I've now watched a film made by the same people, 'Oldboy' I'm glad I did. Because I think that many of us have been kind of lulled into believing that the only way to make a film is 'the Hollywood way.' I didn't like 'I Saw the Devil' when I started watching it, but, after persevering, I was glad I did in the end. Plus, now I feel I know Korean cinema a little better (or how it's done) I was able to enjoy (if that's the right word) 'Oldboy' from the off.And it's certainly a difficult film to describe, let alone say who's its target audience is. A man – and not a particularly nice one – doesn't bother seeing his estranged wife and baby daughter in favour of generally going out and getting drunk. However, things quickly catch up with him when he's swiped off the streets and locked in a room for no less than fifteen years without explanation. However, during this time he's had more than a few changes of heart. Now he's not only ready to find out and punish whoever imprisoned him in the first place, but also make amends with his daughter, who is now basically grown up in his absence.It would be easy to label Oldboy as a 'revenge thriller.' Yes, there are certainly aspects of hunting down those who wronged him. But it's the way it's done that makes it so different. I would go into specifics, but it's one of those films where if you say too much about the plot you will give away vital points which will lead to you predicting what's to come. It's fair to say that there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you interested (or disgusted?) and you will not only need to be ready for those, but also have a strong stomach in terms of content material.Which brings me back to my thoughts on who it's marketed at. I don't really know – people who like revenge movies, but can tolerate some pretty disturbing story lines mainly. Oh, and subtitles. It's got subtitles – but then you probably guessed that. However, even though you have to read the dialogue it's still easy to tell that the cast are pretty impressive and there are performances that are going to stick with you – even if some of them are for the wrong reasons.Basically, if you like your foreign revenge films dark then give this one a go. Just don't blame me for any therapy you may require after sitting through it. A classic, but a dark one."
Ms_Carter,"Mar 17, 2024",8/10,"I have known about this movie for quite a while
But for one reason or another
I never got around to watching it until recently
This is a sick twisted tale of revenge
It's not a perfect movie
(In my opinion anyway) The story moves to fast and feels all over the place
When I think of revenge movies
I think of slower pacing and more details on why the person is seeking revenge
I actually had to watch one of those ending explained videos
Before I understood it
To me the fact I had to go to a ending explained video indicates it's not a perfect movie But now that I get it I'd say it's a good movie and the ending suits the story But it's nowhere near a great or perfect movie."
Semmes6469,"Apr 9, 2024",9/10,"I've heard about this movie for a long time but keep putting off watching it. WOW it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was visually stunning. It was shocking, but somehow it was beautiful and poignant. My review is not doing this film justice. But I really want to recommend it to anyone who thinks it's too old or outdated. It is not. This movie puts all the movies I've watched recently to shame. If you like a good twist? This one is going to deliver!!! The acting is impeccable. The cinematography top notch. The score is moody and dramatic. Warning it is violent but it has to be for the story to come together. I am so glad I finally watched it. Love it!"
nicolechan916,"Jan 13, 2016",8/10,"The trailer is no indication of what you will sit through as the film plays. I was at the same time both deeply disturbed and a little intrigued to see how it would end. Safe to say, I was not at all prepared to spend my Friday night like that. I can't say much without giving away the surprising elements of the film, but if you are considering watching the film, just bear in mind that you will probably be traumatised.I think the reason why I reacted so strongly (and negatively) to this film, is because I have been brought up in a society which considers these topics taboo and cannot even think to imagine if this were to happen to me. So in a way, the film questions the conventions of society and challenges us by putting us outside our comfort zone (way outside).The acting is great as the actors/actresses fully embodied their characters. The interactions between Min-sik, Ji-tae and Hye-jeong went smoothly and is realistic to watch. Min-sik does his character justice as a tortured man with almost nothing left to lose. Ji-tae while still having the looks of an innocent young man delivers the emotions of a sadistic and somewhat mentally unstable character creatively. Hye- jeong too, plays her role as the innocent and oblivious damsel well. However, it seems like a waste to have her introduced as a strong independent woman at the beginning and then turn her into a shallow headed female who is basically useless. Going off that, this film is so obviously male centred, and females are only used for their bodies.The use of props though used mostly for violent acts, are very impactful. A hammer becomes part of Min-sik's signature, replaced teeth turns into a clue, photographs are used to reveal past events and gift boxes no longer connote something positive. The director and writers (based on comic) are quite ingenious in this way, and everything is displayed in a way that ties to the end. Still, I will not be watching this again or the Hollywood remake for that matter."
denisbobaric,"Apr 11, 2021",N/A,One of the best movies in long time...so thrilling so scary and so full of vengance ....🙂 Must see.
imagiking,"Jul 27, 2010",8/10,"The second of Chan-wook Park's ""Vengeance Trilogy"", Oldeuboi appears to be the most revered and respected of the thematic triplets. Having absolutely loved the first, Boksuneun naui Geot, I was highly sceptical that this could possibly do any better.Having been imprisoned inexplicably for fifteen years, Dae-su Oh finds himself released just as suddenly and mysteriously. Knowing nothing about where or why he was kept, he sets out on a quest for revenge, meeting along the way a sushi chef with whom he begins to fall in love.One of the opening scenes, in which Dae-su stumbles drunkenly about a police station, provides us with nice humour: partly a way to lull us into a false sense of security; partly a way to make the darkness which follows tolerable. Like its predecessor, Oldeuboi is incredibly dark and gritty, both its themes and imagery constantly exploring the very depths of depravity and despair. The scenes of imprisonment are strange: while Dae-su's cage is neither bare nor uncomfortable, he himself becomes increasingly so, the scenes of graduating delusion and hallucinating building to an inevitable crescendo of tragedy. It is difficult to watch him spiral downwards, not least of all when he learns that he has been framed for the murder of his wife. Min-sik Choi's performance incorporates a flurry of perfectly timed and pitched emotions, cementing an incredibly real character within our minds and allowing him to evolve whilst all the while remembering his thirst for vengeance and the effect of his incarceration. Hye-jeong Kang grounds the film with a meek humility, her unassuming sushi chef the only element of sanity in Dae-su's insane world. The narrative effectively keeps us guessing, the final turns in plot unforeseen and quite striking, adding to the facets a consistently excellent story, and one which invites thought in a genuine manner. Worth noting is the corridor sequence relatively early in the film, a superb technical achievement and one of the film's crowning glories. A true spectacle which presents action in a unique way, bringing a brilliance to what might have been a mundane scene.An entirely exquisite follow-up to the first of the trilogy, Oldeuboi succeeds under the magnificence of Park's direction. Ensuring the further remarkableness of this astounding offering, it leaves all demanding to see part three. For me, it falls just short of the level of excellence achieved by its forebear. An amazing film in any case, it is yet another example of the prowess of South Korean cinema."
Shadman_,"Jan 14, 2024",7/10,"I don't think anyone really deny creativity of making the movie (directing, cinematography, acting..etc)but if u think the story is ""good"" u are naive
The big plot twist was disturbing for me. Before that i was ok with blood, kill, stress, torture, nudity & miserable characters but the angle the approach the direction of the plot was stupidU can maybe argue about obvious plot holes and unanswered necessary questions in the story but thats not the case for everyone.I have watched dark, complicated, thrilled dramas, so i don't really look to find problems of a movie or shows like some other people do
I have seen disoriented shows like the boys, American horror story..etc
I have read gloomy mangas like berserk, vinland saga, attack on titan..etc (they are much beter than this)
And its not my first time watching Korean movies."
libby-75255,"Oct 28, 2019",10/10,"It's very rare to see good revenge based movies since so few exist. This movie was incredible and is so good at showing the conflict that vengeance causes.The acting was incredible, the cinematography was well thought out, and the dialogue is full of subtle foreshadowing, character development, and purposeful re incorporation.The psychological horror and struggle is presented so well and I left this movie thinking about the lessons and questions it presented me with. This movie made me think in ways no other movie has managed to do before.The story is also dark and twisted and doesn't shy away from showing everything. Which I think is amazing, it's so bold and unapologetic and it really helps the story develop properly.The director and writer wanted to tell a story, and they wouldn't stop at anything to tell it. Truly a masterpiece."
GregTheStopSign95,"Jul 22, 2025",8/10,"I'm not gonna lie, I watched this because I'd heard the hallway fight scene was incredible, and that it was one of the main inspirations for the hallway fight in the first season of Daredevil, and you know what? It was NOT good.The rest of the movie, however, was wonderfully strange and weird. The acting was pretty solid all around, especially Choi Min-Sik as the lead character Oh Dae-Su.That reveal and ending, though? That can go kick rocks, that was messed UP! And I mean, the reveal itself was messed up but for THAT follow-up? No thanks. I actually mostly enjoyed the movie up until the reveal, but that pretty much soured everything that came before it for me."
adamschretz,"Nov 16, 2021",9/10,"Awesome movie with great cinematography, plot, characters and twists, but I'd say it's not for everyone, beacuse it's pretty dark and has a lot of rough scenes, e.g. A squid which is eaten alive.I recently read the manga by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi and I think, that Park Chan-Wook did a great job out of this mediocre source. The manga is like a 6/10, because the pacing was very slow, the fight scenes weren't as good as in the movie, and the final plot ""twist"" was boring. I liked, that the dialogues were better, it filled a few little plottholes and clarified a few things of the movie, which were kinda complicated.I recommend reading the manga before watching the movie, but if you only watch the movie you won't miss anything."
Darkside-Reviewer,"May 26, 2021",8/10,"Old Boy (2003) is by far one of the weirdest and most disturbing films I have seen in quiet a while. I went into this movie knowing very little about the movies plot other than what was printed on the back of the movies Blu-ray cover. I knew Oldboy was a vengeance story that much was obvious but I had no idea just how twisted and insane this movie was going to be.The story follows a ordinary man named Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) who finds himself the victim of a kidnapping. Dae-Su wakes up and finds himself prisoner inside a private makeshift prison cell with no knowledge of why he was kidnapped or for how long his captors intend on keeping him prisoner for. Dae-Su spends the next fifteen years alone, trapped within the confines of his makeshift prison with his only source of information and entertainment being a Television. Then one day without any rhyme or reason Dae-Su finds himself waking up inside a suitcase in the same place where he was kidnapped fifteen years ago. Now a free man Dae-Su sets out on a mission of vengeance to uncover why he was kidnapped and by who so he can finally exact blood soaked vengeance upon the one responsible for his suffering.Oldboy is an absolutely stunning film that keeps it's audience on the edge of their seat from start to finish with it's cleverly written and well thought out storyline, stunning visuals, and intense fight scenes. I was honestly blown away by this movie's over the top violence and expertly shot action sequences.I highly recommend watching Oldboy it's a one of kind movie that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Jan 16, 2022",8/10,"""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone.""It's completely different as compared to the other traditional tales of retaliation. Simply cause this time vengeance has moulded itself to be a double-edged sword. Above all, it's an eloquent (whiffs of Kafkaesque Nightmare) delineation about how one man's single misstep could lead to disastrous consequences. Besides, there's also a tangible psychological/philosophical aspect, that would give birth to an unbidden conundrum in your mind.Oldboy is impulsively raw, unashamedly tenacious and this same murkier posture helps it to attain the right kind of vibe and atmosphere the story craved for. Further complemented through and through by its technical prowess, that is only matched by an extraordinary enactment coming directly from the main guy i.e. Choi Min-Sik. He took precedence over everything and everyone else, period. Suffice it to say, his performance alone has elevated this film to greater heights!"
amiraligamani,"Jun 17, 2025",7/10,"Oldboy, directed by Park Chan-wook, is a film that grabs the viewer from the very first frame and refuses to let go until the devastating end. On a technical level, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Choi Min-sik's performance as Oh Dae-su stands among the greatest in cinema history - a haunting portrayal of pain, rage, and confusion that forces the audience to empathize with a man on the edge.Park Chan-wook's direction is meticulous, layered with meaning and style in every shot. From the claustrophobic setting of the private prison to the iconic corridor fight, each scene feels like a living painting. The cinematography and lighting create an atmosphere drenched in dread, while Jo Yeong-wook's melancholy score underscores the characters' internal wounds.Yet, beneath its poetic and philosophical surface, the film's core message left me unsettled. Oldboy tells a tale of revenge, identity, and guilt, but ultimately seems to legitimize the survival of monsters rather than confronting their evil. The film's conclusion, wrapped in tragic beauty, conveys an uncomfortable notion - that monsters can and perhaps should endure. For all its artistic brilliance, this idea felt deeply unjust to me.The film's emotional climax, where Oh Dae-su degrades himself to unthinkable depths - kissing the feet of his enemy, barking like a dog, and even cutting out his own tongue - is unforgettable. It's a scene that will linger in the memory of cinema, but it also poses a disturbing question: at what cost does survival come, and what does that say about justice?Oldboy is essential viewing - a film to admire for its craftsmanship, but also one that demands critical reflection on its troubling themes. Cinema is not only about form; it is about substance. And here, the substance leaves room for serious doubt."
TalvinH,"Jul 11, 2025",10/10,"I knew there was a plot twist yet still, my jaw was on the floor when it happened. Don't give up half way through this movie just because it's all over the place. I was so confused watching but at the end it all just lines up so perfectly. If you have seen moments it's that feeling but better of a whole 2 hours of madness just lining up perfectly. The cinematography is done so well and the infamous 1 take, 1v20 fight scene is sooo good. The cinematography in that scene is the best I've ever seen. It has quirky and funny scenes as well but still keeps its serious tone. I doubt anyone's reading but if you are I highly recommend you to watch this movie."
vithiet,"Sep 3, 2024",7/10,"This movie has been on my list for a long time, especially since in certain circles it seems to have reached a bit of a cult status in recent years. And I think because of that my expectations were a bit skewed. First of all, I always heard how shocking it is and I assumed that it was referring to ultraviolent visuals, which is not necessarily the case. And while the script is somewhat original, it also doesn't always make a lot of sense if you think about it a little too long. That being said, it is very well directed, and for the most part, acting is on point (you need to be ok with the typical Asian cinema ""overacting"" at times). Overall not a bad movie, but not the masterpiece I was expecting."
mahtab600,"May 2, 2021",9/10,"I watched the movie about 18 years after its original release but let me tell you something I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!

jalexanderdh,"Oct 23, 2007",10/10,"The leading character of the story is a family man who killed his wife. It is not clear how he did it or why he did it though. In the opening scene, he was to go home bringing angel's wings stuff for her sweet plum - his daughter. But he was kidnapped before he can walk any further, and he was kept in a secure special prison for 15 years.In those 15 long years, he entertained himself in watching TV, writing a journal, and training himself in fighting. He was served dumplings every time, and most often he doesn't eat the food being served to him. Little by little, he digs a hole in the wall covered by his bedside. He just use a chopstick to do it, and he planned to get outside on the 15th year of his stay...When he gets out, his first mission was to find his capturer. and the tragedy just keeps getting better from there.After I watched the film, I made a donation to the website where I watched it. It was the best of tragedies I have ever watched. You can say it to yourself."
Quebec_Dragon,"Jul 17, 2011",9/10,"An alcoholic father and husband is captured and kept in captivity during 15 years without knowing why. When he gets out, he's hell-bent on revenge and discovering why he was imprisoned. This is a powerful movie with strong dramatic performances. It's intense and constantly keeps you on your toes. The story is amazing and full of twists and turns until the very end. Speaking of twists, the film is a bit twisted in itself by the themes it portrays. It does make us question what is moral and acceptable in revenge. The directing is bold and inventive.There's a long fight scene without cuts in a corridor that's practically an anthology piece. Other memorable moments involve teeth and a tongue. Notice how the director often plays with our expectations showing relatively little but creeping us out nevertheless. The story also plays with our perceptions of the characters, making them more or less sympathetic. The main character has quite the character arc transformation, completely changing physically and psychologically during the course while keeping the viewer on edge because he's a bit unstable... So, it's overall quite fascinating, intellectually stimulating, viscerally gripping, and heartily recommended provided you don't expect a simple, typical revenge movie and you keep an open mind.Rating: 8.5 out 10 (remarkable)"
Sakowsky,"Aug 26, 2007",6/10,"A classic Korean revenge film developed by the mastermind Chan-wook Park couldn't be any better then what it has become. The movie itself has attributed a rather love it or hate it personality during its introduction to the American public and its rather explicit and disturbing scene for sex. I entirely understand its concept and brutality; it is after all a great homage to film-noir and attempts to break every boundary to become one of the darkest films ever created without being a actual horror.During the 15 year imprisonment scene the character had lost all possible nature of himself as he had been forced to become a animal. Masterbating to dancing women. Writing in his journal on whom would have put him through all this pain. Training in combat by punching the wall. Slowly cutting through the brick to at least just feel the breeze of the outside and the rain trickle over his hand and even attempting to smash his head against glass in attempt to kill himself.All that was once the character had been lost in a spiral of insanity in his solitary confinement. Upon release his character had to regain the ability to live in society. He had to learn new words, he had to learn to laugh, to love, to feel guilt and sorrow and to cry. All this character development to a beautiful soundtrack mixed with classical and techno themes.Only flaw in this movie would have to be the one scene when Oh Dae-su takes the roll of super-man and cleanses the underground of all the scum. That wasn't enough to interrupt the brilliance of the movie. The time he was lying on the ground with a grin on his face before he put the cigarette in his mouth or the time hes walking away laughing after the man has fallen from the roof onto a car.In end this movie will not make you laugh. No it will make you cry on behalf of how we lost the film industry to Korea. Because remember when you laugh, the world laughs with you but when you cry, you cry alone."
blocan,"Dec 24, 2003",9/10,"Can we get a truth which tells us ""who must be blamed""?The answer is 'NO'. It's void to follow the sin.I guess the director spits out some kinds of nihilism and cynicism.But at the same time, there must be 'a right to live' as saying >"
awwelsh-1,"Feb 3, 2006",6/10,"I think the best word to sum up how I felt after watching Oldboy was ""frustrated."" The premise underlying the film is an interesting take-off of The Count of Monte Cristo and it certainly promises a lot of potential. And the director certainly cannot be accused of taking obvious directions to appease the masses. I certainly paid close attention to Oldboy and, admittedly, watched it a second time. But in all honesty, I did not enjoy it and I can say wholeheartedly that this must be one of the most overrated films on IMDb.Like many of Oldboy's harshest critics, my major problem with the film was the big ""twist"" - - the reason Dae Su was imprisoned. This twist was completely preposterous. Even in the realm of fantasy/action films, I just could not swallow it. It felt like the kind of cheap twist you would find in a B slasher movie like Prom Night. Unlike films like Sixth Sense, where you can re-watch and see connections that lead to the surprise twist, you can't do that with Oldboy. Further, the twist does not fit with the overall mood of the film. Oldboy strives for a real and grim atmosphere but the major villain's plan fits better with a James Bond film.Oldboy has other problems. Its action set-pieces are not particularly impressive and are few and far between. There is no action scene that will stick out in your mind, like Hard-boiled or The Killer. Yes, there are some seat-squirming graphic revenge scenes, but even they are not as ""extreme"" as advertised.Ultimately, Oldboy's success hinges on the suspense and impact of its major plot twist and, given its implausibility, the film falters and falls on its face. I have seen that this film has been scheduled for a re-make and, despite generally disliking remakes, I think Oldboy is an excellent candidate. Somewhere in this muddled mess is a great idea that, with the right script, could make an excellent movie."

No exp at cinema at all, but still after five years, after great evolution of me, it is still flawless and brilliant. Originally i watched this on the edge, right before i changed my whole perception on the world, people and phenomena, right before destruction of everything that i've ever known and believed, before falling into the abyss and being lost inside of my head. How is that even possible?P. S. Handmaiden and Thirst definitely not match to this one at all. But i definitely gonna watch some more of Chan-wook."

If any of the following ring a bell: ""Code 46"", ""Irréversible"" or ""The Truman Show"" you'll get your money's worth with this movie. If by the end of it, you're disappointed that it doesn't give you any higher purpose, tough luck.About the action: a shabby semi-good guy, loaded with TV clichés tries to catch up with a superb villain. Nobody wins or, better said, they both loose. There's no elaborate story line, no claims of realism whatsoever. It's not so much about a gory revenge but more about a dark, sinuous journey for redemption.If this movie teaches you anything, it's no to look for greater-than-life answers in fortune cookies. Or movies, for that matter.7/10"
vincentga,"Sep 7, 2007",9/10,"I am not Asian nor pro-Asian. I do not live in Asia. I try always to be objective.And objectively this film is really very good. A masterpiece.I believe that it is the first time that I comment on a film and gives 9/10. I NEVER give 10/10 cause NOTHING is perfect. But this movie is near perfection. This Korean film is remarkable. WOWWWWWWWWWWWW !!!!!!!!!!!!!All is good in this film. Actors and actresses, photography, music, and of course the history (the scenario).That made well at least 20 years that I had not seen a film of this kind.It is well one of rare Asian films where nudity is seen (without vulgarity of course).I would give a Oscar for this film. But unfortunately it is not as that which that it's work in Hollywood. It is necessary to form part of the ""Hollywood Clan"".I hope that the authors of this film will continue to make also remarkable films and that it will not make likeHollywood. To make turnips and to only think of the money.In any case Korean gives a good cinematographic lesson to American.I you council highly to buy this film because it is a rare masterpiece since they are 25 last years.It's good to see a film where we don't know all the story even before to have it. It's good to see they are again some (but few) people who are able to use their brain to make remarkable movie. It's good to see people who make movie who don't think that people who watch movies are all idiots..."
george.schmidt,"Mar 28, 2005",7/10,"OLDBOY (2005) **1/2 Min-Sik Choi, Ji tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang. (Korean with subtitles) Intriguing mix of ""Memento"" meets ""Payback"" by way of ""Chinatown"" in this mixed bag of revenge, incest and vengeance when simple businessman Choi is abducted and held prisoner for 15 years seemingly inexplicably and when set free is given 5 days by his mysterious kidnapper (Yu) to resolve exactly why he was. Filmmaker Chan-wook Park (who co-wrote with Jo-yun Hwang, Chun-hyeong Lim, Joon-hyung Lim and Garon Tsuchiya) has a strong visual sense overall with his many layered edits and camera angles askew yet ultimately the film suffers in the overblown last act yet Choi makes a very original anti-hero with echoes of Charles Bronson and the ""Death Wish"" films but something seems lost in the translation with its execution although there are a few highlights including some visceral fight sequences and the edge-on-your-seat intrigue as to how the payoff will finally arrive."
ozguryalaz-1,"Mar 7, 2017",10/10,"Masterpiece, different, shocking, great script, absolutely must be watched ...Uncomfortable, sick, but watching is so enjoyable, with an extraordinary visuality, sickly illusion and a captivating film in one word"
WriterDave,"Feb 13, 2005",7/10,"""Oldboy"" is best viewed on a clean slate. I knew nothing about it before watching it, only that a friend recommend it. Similar in fashion to ""Donnie Darko"" or ""Fight Club"" this is a film that once you know the twist and how it ends (and this has a climax ripped right from the bleeding heart of a Greek tragedy) it probably won't hold up on repeat viewing all that well. As such, I will probably avoid watching it again, as it was oddly endearing and I would rather remember it well than think about it too much and ruin the experience.A simplistic and twisted revenge plot gets shrouded in claustrophobic mystery and visual chutzpah (the camera work and color scheming are intense and satisfying, a stunning blend of Scorsese and Zhang Zimou) that tricks the unsuspecting viewer into thinking they are watching something more special than it really is. There's also a fantastic music score blending classical pieces with techno music. The music and the imagery last in the viewer's mind long after the film ends. Unfortunately the story line and characters do not. I suppose on a simple motion picture level (where one views film-making as a purely visual and sound art form) the film is a rousing success. However, if you wish to view film as a story telling art form, this repetitive and contrived motion picture fails miserably. Already pegged for a Hollywood remake that will no doubt pummel the style over substance nature of the film into the ground."
ogjprov,"Sep 12, 2021",9/10,Insane ending. I'm still in shock. The last 15 minutes were absolutely incredible.
Dolchi,"Jun 10, 2022",9/10,"This is one of the ""great action classics"" of Korean cinema.One scene alone is most-watched online from this film, speaking to the fine calibre of action in this movie. However, the plot in this film is also intense and makes up for a very non-standard viewing.The characters are so well-designed that you feel all of their problems and the seemingly different/normal people have a normal/different side to them. Many times, the director finds us making excuses to watch this film as anyone who wants to leave cannot. The well written screenplay is the reason behind this success.All in all, this is a fine action flick if you love films with a controversial plot."
thestrangersingerr,"Jan 9, 2023",10/10,"I could just imagine the making behind this movie and think what the environment would have been and what does the people working behind a movie like this look like, obviously humans and similar to most of us lol, but seriously this movie never lost me even for a second, the story and the plots it displays are probably the best and original piece of art I have seen in a while , same as the direction and acting,Talking about the acting first it's fascinating how much a actor can make you fall into a fictional world and make you believe in it , the action is heavenly and the direction of some scenes for example the last one made me cry but not in the sense of only crying it made me feel what they could have been feeling isn't that what movies are supposed to do? To make you be there in that make believe world well this is a movie and a masterpiece in that , btw this is the only movie that made me post a review for a movie for the first time in my life it's that good...."
invenio,"Feb 26, 2025",9/10,"Park Chan-wook's ""Oldboy"" (2003) is a harrowing descent into vengeance, obsession and the devastating consequences of unresolved conflicts. Deeply psychological and brutally violent, the film crafts an intricate, almost operatic tragedy where every action stems from an inability to confront and resolve trauma in a meaningful way.At its core, ""Oldboy"" explores how suppressed resentment festers, distorting reality and poisoning lives. Oh Dae-su, the protagonist, is imprisoned for 15 years without explanation, only to be released into a nightmarish scavenger hunt for the truth. His captor, Lee Woo-jin, engineers this elaborate punishment not out of necessity but as a way to cope with his own unresolved guilt and anguish. Instead of processing his grief or confronting the past with clarity, Woo-jin channels his pain into a cruel game of retribution, setting in motion a cycle of suffering that ultimately consumes them both.The film's bleakest revelation is that all of its horrors-psychological manipulation, brutal violence and tragic love-are the result of adults failing to deal with their pasts constructively. Communication is absent, replaced by silence, secrets and revenge. Dae-su himself, despite his transformation into a hardened survivor, remains emotionally stunted, acting on impulse rather than introspection. When the final, devastating truth is revealed, it underscores how deep-seated pain can twist even the most mundane actions into something monstrous.Through its stunning cinematography, visceral fight sequences, and haunting score, ""Oldboy"" does not merely tell a revenge story-it dissects the human condition at its most self-destructive. It suggests that when people fail to address their wounds with maturity and understanding, they risk creating tragedies far worse than the original pain. The film is dark, not just in its subject matter, but in its fundamental belief that justice and catharsis are illusions, and that, for some, escape from suffering may only be found in oblivion."
Chrysanthepop,"Jul 4, 2008",N/A,"Visually stunning and stylishly executed, Chan-wook Park's 'Oldboy' is loosely based on 'Oedipus' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. On the technical front, it gets almost everything right. The background score is marvelous. The action sequences are well shot even though poorly choreographed. The cinematography and visuals are stunning. The CGI is fake at times (for example the ant crawling under the skin scene). The dialogues are wannabe symbolic and wannabe philosophical. The acting is over-the-top. I didn't see any point in the movie as a whole. Nor did 'Oldboy' entertain me neither did it enlighten. I fail to understand what puts this film on a World Cinema level and what is it that so many love about this movie? Was it the shock value with all the gruesome and gory scenes? It starts on an interesting note but then one finds out that it's a silly contrived revenge plot (not to mention the numerous plot holes). What was Park trying to imply? That it's okay for the brother to have sex with his sister and that Dae-Su's telling someone about it in confidence was the bigger crime? Or is it that the best revenge would be to make him have sex with his own daughter? Don't even get me started on the whole hypnosis-erasing-your-memory crap. In my humble opinion, 'Oldboy' is quite a stupid pretentious movie. It's executed quite well but has no substance. A waste of my time."
AhmedSpielberg99,"Aug 29, 2018",8/10,"Amélie's quirkiness, Tarantino's violence and gore, interesting characters, intriguing plot, profound philosophical questions, and insanely cool action sequences made this gut-wrenching revenge tale the most gripping, entertaining, and enthralling movie of its kind, except it's actually one of a kind!Amid the gruesome scenes, and the brutal fight sequences, Oldboy has a very emotionally devastating story. Chan-wook Park could have easily leaned on nothing but the action and the gore to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning. Instead, he knew that if there is anything that can attract the attention of the audience, and make them invested in the protagonist as fast as possible, it would be a thoughtful moral philosophy mingled with a sentimental story. That's how Chan-wook Park captivated the viewers from the opening scene until he evoked a catharsis in the audience at the traumatic third act.Flawless is a very weak, and unsatisfying word to describe the third act. It's simply look like nothing you've seen before, or even you'll see. With its twist reveal, to the outrageous and shocking visceral images, the third act is provocative, distressful, and utterly maddening. But nothing would have worked in it, and in the entire movie as a whole without Min-sik Choi's kinetic multi-layered performance.The fact that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nod, at least for Min-sik Choi's incredible performance, is as infuriating as the movie itself. For me, Min-sik Choi delivered one of the best performances in the past decade. Yes, I would easily put his performance alongside Adrien Brody's in The Pianist, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But all that thanks to Chan-wook Park who allowed Min-sik Choi to show all his talent challenging him, and his pathetic, Dae-su Oh.What is truly impressive is how Chan-wook Park put us in Dae-su Oh's shoes by changing the tone, so gracefully, to resemble how the protagonist feels. The movie starts off with flashes of dark humor matching how mazed and lost the character feels. Then, when things become more clearer and clearer the tone becomes darker and darker till the climax when the movie became acutely distressing and dreary.Nevertheless, these tonal changes didn't work very well at the second act. Not because the tonal shift wasn't smooth, nor it came abruptly, but because that was the time when our protagonist, as well as us, discovering clues, and collecting pieces to get the whole picture. The whole act was very convoluted, for better or worse, but the thing is that the pacing was madly rushed resembling Dae-su Oh's confusion and ignorance. Not to mention, there were some sequences where we get to know about some very important characters, and some specifics related to them. Adding insult to injury, some of these details could be passed up, because they are simply not that important. The result is that the movie almost lost me a couple of times. I mean that I really lose track of some small details.Oldeuboi is a very powerful, thought-provoking, and visceral film, and that's because what it implies more than what it depicts. I think it's the first Korean film I watch, and it definitely won't be the last. Just help me with some recommendations, if you wouldn't mind! :)(8.5/10)"
eagandersongil,"Jan 28, 2017",8/10,"Inspired by the manga manga, ""Oldboy"" impresses the West, as it deals with violence and revenge in a surprising way, showing that even the smallest acts have their weight. We see here the story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a man full of regrets and sins who one day is imprisoned for fifteen years in a room, and when he leaves, he wants revenge, it seems a simple script, Make no mistake, inside this revenge we have several layers, twists, intrigue, suspense, action and of course, a touch of black humor. The photograph of ""Oldboy"" is very beautiful, all the colors are very defined, Dae- su's room is dazzling and at the same time despairing, the city is lifeless, we have that neon touch in dark scenes, even the same Being present, is an extremely clean photograph, and the soundtrack, well, it is a spectacle to the part, with orchestral musics ""Oldboy"" is sensational, mixing the violence when orchestrating a beautiful song - as in mechanical orange (7I) - all The times that your theme music plays, you delight and serve perfectly as a counterpoint to what is being shown the screen, and the last technical aspect that I would like to comment, what a fabulous edition, my congratulations. Yoo Ji-tae has a sensational performance, it's that villain that makes us all hate him, that is, he fulfilled his role, Choi Min-sik impresses at times with his expression caricats and scandals, but he lacks a dramatic tone And Kang Hye-Jeong does not have a dramatic or humorous tone, but is beautiful and concentrates all the attention on screen, this is the film that consecrates the career of the great director - the most popular in Western culture - Park Chan-Wook. The film does not contain an explicit moral, quite the contrary, it completely attacks and distorts what we know about morality, and its final message is troubled, loaded with oriental manias, ""Oldboy"" behaves very well, even in his scenes galletas de Action your trail and beautiful photography. It's a worthwhile movie, and it's the perfect gateway to Korean cinema."

MuhammedN-535,"Jun 22, 2025",8/10,"It's one of the well-written movies, but I do not think anyone should watch it. There are other good and great movies out there. I wish I hadn't seen this one. I'm writing this review right after watching it, and I don't recommend this movie to any normal person.If you choose not to follow my advice and watch the movie, the final act will crash over you like a wave and take away your sense of joy in life-at least for a while. I hope that period is short. The final act was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. Still, I want to emphasize once again that while it's truly a well-made film, I believe it's one that should not be watched."
Sheol1812,"Oct 17, 2021",10/10,"Flawless. Absolutely flawless. Without a doubt one of the most well-crafted plot twists in the history of cinema. Few films match the pace, suspense and overall rush that Oldboy builds. The tension at every turn is mesmerizing. By the time you finish the film you're breathing a sigh of relief because of how invested you became. This is one for the ages folks.It is a mandatory watch."
tytushar-87734,"Oct 13, 2021",10/10,"Just watch it, the ending twist will stay with you forever. The cinematography was amazing. This movie was made in 2003 even though it has one of the best quality and editing. Thanks to the director. One thing that the screenplay is sharp so keep you focus at the subtitles."
Mersault2112,"Jul 1, 2018",10/10,"Oldeuboi is currently, and has been for a while now, my favorite movie. Min-sik Choi plays his role flawlessly. This movie promises you an exciting experience right off the bat, and then entirely over-delivers and becomes something much more than you expected going into it.You name it, this movie does it incredibly well. The cinematography is nothing short of artistic. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting and very emotional. The writing and storytelling are the best I've ever seen, and call back to classic tragedies and the tragic hero. I find that American audiences generally don't like this movie much because of it's nontraditional storytelling and ending. If you're interested in something you won't ever get out of an American movie, this will deliver. And don't worry about being bored, because not a second of the runtime of this movie is wasted. There is always either action happening on screen, plot being developed, or cinematography being shown off. Most of the time all at once. Even if you don't like drama, or don't like international movies, it can be appreciated for so many different things that everyone will find something to love about it. The fight scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen, and aren't even one of the main reasons why I love this movie. If you aren't very open to stories that are nontraditional or something you're not used to seeing in the West, you might take issue with this movie, to which I'd say you need to open up some more, because you're missing out on a great experience.As I said earlier, Min-sik Choi is an incredible actor, and after watching Oldeuboi I watched two of his other films, ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time"", both of which are incredible films that I suggest you go watch if you liked Oldeuboi or are interested in Korean cinema but want something other than Oldeuboi. Min-sik Choi delivers an almost, but not quite as amazing performance in both of those movies. Oldeuboi itself is a great dive into Korean cinema and what it has to offer. Watch this movie if you get the chance."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Oct 24, 2018",9/10,My Rating : 9/10'Oldboy' is the quintessential Korean thriller. Enough has been said about it so no point in me going into the details.

jashminocha,"Jul 26, 2020",10/10,"There are very movies that deserves to be called as a masterpiece and calling this work of art as a masterpiece does not do this movie justice. This is perfection in its rawest form, art in its most purest form presented in a long long time, after watching which, you will contemplate the ending for days or even months to come. I don't know if I can assign a genre to this movie, if its a thriller it is the best thriller that anyone has ever made, if its a revenge action flick, its the best revenge action flick that anyone has ever made. And the ending, literally, the most jaw dropping, mind bending climax I have ever witness in the history of cinema. I cannot shower enough praise due to the limitations provided by the alphabets in the English language which prohibits me to describe this masterful of a work in just 26 alphabets, its impossible for me to convey something this beautiful, this magnificent with just words. But lets not restrict art by assigning a numeric representation or alphabetical description and just enjoy this art in its purest and truest form."
YARDCG,"Mar 11, 2025",6/10,"Oldboy is one of those films which are driven by the powerhouse central performance and build up to a single massive twist - so one's overall opinion is most likely going to depend greatly on how strong your reaction to that twist was.As such, I perhaps started with a disadvantage, having already seen a casual mention of said twist years ago. Even so, I doubt I would have been shocked even if it was new to me - simply because I have never been a great fan of the narratives where overly-intricate plots just unfold near-perfectly over years and decades, with almost none of the strain, messiness and friction which comes with attempting to puppeteer human beings, regardless of whether such plots come from the protagonists or antagonists.Here, it's all the more ironic, since the antagonist's motivation is perhaps an archetypal example of human messiness. The idea the antagonist had the foresight, resources and wherewithal to come up with everything we learn he did by the end, yet failed to resolve the inciting incident of the whole thing in an incomparably simpler fashion is practically comic book logic - but then again - Oldboy IS a manga adaptation, which explains A LOT about its structure and internal logic.Hence, as a graphic medium often does, it frequently focuses on making individual scenes stand out over overall flow - for one, I dare anyone to explain how the opening scene makes any sense or has a true significance besides accentuating protagonist's ""edginess"" in the context of what we learn by the end of the film. Likewise, while the corridor fight halfway through is a famous and oft-emulated scene for good reason, the fighting which takes place by the end of the film is virtually meaningless.For all of that, it's still a well-directed film with great performances, and well-situated in the context of its era. (The montages which indicate time passing at the start are even better as a time capsule now then they must have been when it was first released.) And more than 20 years on, it's still hard to think of a film of such caliber where the lead was committed enough to genuinely eat a live octopus on camera. (In fact, Choi Min-sik ended up doing it FOUR times because Park Chan-Wook required four takes.)"

It is perfect, the direction, the performance of the actors, the soundtrack, the photography and the story is just wonderful. If this is the first time seeing Chang-Wook Park movies I recommend to see JSA, Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. All this movies are great, and probably are the best work from Mr. Park, but OldBoy is a true Master Piece. You can't die without seeing this movie.10 of 10.PS: I also highly recommend Tae Guk Gi, is not from Chang-Wook Park, but Min-Sik Choi (Oh Daesu in OldBoy) is on it."
gangstahippie,"Jan 28, 2008",9/10,"Rated R for strong violence including scenes of torture, sexuality and pervasive language.After a year of pestering from a friend, I finally watched Oldboy.Oldboy is the second film in the Chan Woo Park Vengeance trilogy.The first film in the series is Sympathy For Mr Vengeance and the third film is Sympathy For Lady Vengeance.The films are all in one trilogy but have nothing to really do with each other, besides the fact that the films are all about revenge.I did not see lady vengeance but I didn't really care for mr vengeance that much.I found it to be a bit boring.It was an alright film though.Oldboy is much much better.The film is much more interesting, thought-provoking and entertaining than the first film.A man mysteriously gets locked up for 15 years.When he is released, he seeks vengeance on the man who locked him up.There are many plot twists in the film and you will find yourself on the edge of your seat when you watch it.Even if you didn't like Mr.Vengeance, Oldboy is worth a look!"
huan6010,"Apr 20, 2007",8/10,"The only similarity between the killer (Cho) was a ""hammer"" pose from OldBoy (and Cho got it the pose wrong too). There is no similarity between this psycho (Cho) and the movie's story line / character. To blame this movie for this killer's action is misguided.As for not watching certain movies or reading books or listening to songs because they association with real world psychos, - would you stop reading ""Catcher in the Rye"" because it associated with John Lennon's killer? - would you stop listening to the Beatle's music because they associated with Charles Manson? - would you stop watching Jodie Foster's movies because she ""inpired"" John Warnock Hinckley, Jr to attempt an assassination on President Reagan? - the list go on and on."
stephen-bellinger,"Feb 1, 2007",9/10,"What can you expect from this film? A gripping story and great cinematography, some very graphic scenes. You will forget its a subtitled film if you only speak English like me. If you are a little squeamish is maybe not a film you should watch. But all the violent scenes I found to be well done, even a bit of comedy added in to boot. The films real strength is the story, it unfurls perfectly with just the right amount of pace. I am sure some people will have some bad things to say about this, but I think it is a great piece of work, and it is thoughrouly enjoyable.It kept me glued from beginning to end, and for 30 minutes after as I had to just sit and go over the film again in my head."
asaar,"Jun 3, 2008",10/10,"First off, the plot, one of the things I noticed was a common theme in the comments criticizing ""Oldboy"" was actually quite impressive. There is a twist like in all good movies. If you were one of the folks who saw it coming a mile away, good for you, congratulations. Now you can sit back and enjoy the ride. Oldboy is one of those films that starts out strong, builds you up the whole way through, and then ends with a bang, leaving you satisfied and thinking back at what a great film it was. It follows a lonely man who has many problems but refuses to face them. The movie guides him through a healing path where he discovers the mistakes he made in his life and as a result pays the consequences for them. It really makes the viewer draw many parallels between his or her life and the life of our tragic hero in the film. Not to mention it is beautifully filmed. The choreography in a rather impressive sequence involving some torture and a fight scene involving a hammer (I won't say much more for sake of avoiding spoilers) was fabulous, almost a bit Matrix-esquire. See this movie! It's worth it!"
nkw88,"Sep 3, 2004",N/A,"Some Koreans enjoy eating living octopus though other Koreans don't. It is just as the same as eating sushi and sashimi. You may not be used to eating it or even seeing the scene. Anyway, it is not so shocking to Koreans as to Western audience. You may want to feel 'living things' or 'something fresh',to feel what the life means by eating which is the basic humaninstinct, if you are prisoned 15 years and eat just one itemfried dumping for 15 years. How about canned Ravioli for 15 years or Big Mac for 15 years? Or French Fried for 15 years?For me, Oldboy to Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is what Koryo Blue Porcelain to Chosen White Porcelain. Each film has its own attraction but OldBoy is much more decorative than Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance which shows the beauty and power of the simplicity.I still prefer the latter, though Oldboy is still great."
Chandru2206J,"Sep 15, 2024",7/10,"This movie is about Dae-su Oh, held as a prisoner for 15 years and gets released to find his captor. The movie covers the pursuit of Dae-su, the reason for being in prison for 15 years, and disturbing revenge by the villain.The story had a good start, as the plot was interesting for the first 40 minutes. The scenes were written in a raw and dark sense to create a hard-hitting movie. The first fighting scene was good, but at last, it was lame. The characters were written well to create a mysterious feel to the story. The villain's motive was not good enough to take revenge on Dae-su, but after all, being delusional is the villain's trait, too.I slept in between and woke up in a flashback scene; I didn't rewind the movie but continued watching, and still, I understood what was going on. Still, I am not curious to look back on what I missed while I slept. The last and final hard-hitting twist, unfortunately, I saw that coming, and they hinted it already with her things in the bag.The actors were good at their roles. The cinematography and composition were good and set the right mood for the story. The music was not memorable at all.In conclusion, it was a was a decent revenge story for me. Some may find it excellent and hard-hitting due to the last twist. But after watching some even more twisted movies, it's just a predictable one."
mlucien,"Jul 4, 2005",8/10,"Old Boy is a slick action thriller that is both entertaining and ultimately thought provoking. Fincher's 'Fight Club' and Miike's 'Ichi The Killer' have both been raised as stylistic comparisons and there is a lot of merit to this perspective.Essentially, it is about a man's imprisonment and subsequent quest for vengeance against his initially unknown captor. To state more than that would be to spoil a film that relies upon a significant plot-twist. This plot twist has been much discussed. Further, there appears to be a significant amount of ambiguity in the final scene that leaves it open to interpretation as to whether the protagonist has 'taken steps' to move on from the events, or whether he is still a warped monster of revenge.It is safe to say that it is a niche film - one for people who like overt cinematic technique - namely flashy visuals and inventive action sequences. My personal bias is towards such films that take an innovative approach to visuals and for this reason, and the provocative ending, I found it to be a very good film.I think that most people would find it entertaining to some degree. Whether they would find it a good film is a matter of debate. There have been a great many reviews extolling the merits of the film and many eloquent criticisms - both are equally valid.There are continuity lapses and some facile quasi deus ex machina (omnipotent villain) explanations, but in particular, I think the charge of nihilism is quite accurate. It is not a movie where the message is obvious, or indeed one where you could really categorise as having something profound to say about the futility of revenge or the human condition. That said, as a stylish piece of entertainment I enjoyed it immensely. I have seen Park Chan-Wook's 'JSA' and 'Sympathy For Mr Vengeance' and preferred this film. Whether this makes me a vapid pop-culture victim, so be it, but I honestly have a better time seeing something like 'Performance' or '...if' or even 'Ichi The Killer' than 'The Sorrow and the Pity' or 'Through a Glass Darkly'. Great films, like great literature, can be hard work and not always more rewarding."
liciuantonio-03349,"Aug 25, 2024",7/10,"Ok, it's not a bad movie, it's just an ok movie.Too overhyped and without a doubt who gives this movies a rating higher than 7.5 just wants to be different so damn much.I saw some posts that says that this movie is so much better than Shutter Island... shut the **** up. The ""plot twist"" - if you saw more than 3 movies you'll get it from the middle of the movie. Too much dramatic stuff in the end of the movie and too drastically exaggerated.Don't get me wrong, it's worth the watch but i think i'm just upset with the fact that it's sooooooo overrated.If you watched Shutter Island and your rating is 8, ""Oldboy"" i think it won't get higher than 6.5-7."
TDeath,"Sep 8, 2004",4/10,"I went to see this movie because it had a 8.6 rating at IMDb.com. How can people overrate it like that?The first 90 minutes were sooo boring. The whole movie, you wait for something to happen which explains everything. And when that happens in the end, it's just a disappointment. The story is unrealistic, the dialogues are poor (and no they are NOT intellectual, for all wannabe-intellectuals - not only since the few wise sentences have to be repeated five times for everybody to remember them). The few messages could've been brought to the viewer in a much more entertaining way.Like in David Lynch movies, Oldboy forces you to think about it, and think about it, try to find a deeper sense, and while you are watching you realize that there is none - and that's just poor."
bandare-1,"Jan 31, 2007",9/10,"Not having seen any previous films by this director, I went in with an open mind. While I was in Korea in 2004, I asked a few Korean friends, what movies they thought would be worth watching (subtitles permitting!). All of them suggested Oldboy.This film is quite slow to get going but its fitting that you get eased in to the film. It's a very disturbing film and extremely graphic in places. However, I do think its all in keeping with the storyline.To me this is a must see film as a result of the acting, the twists throughout and overall difference that the film puts out to the standard US based movie! If you don't mind some violence and general disturbing content based around torture and violence, then you wont be disappointed. Fantastically executed with great camera work, give it a go!"
kosmasp,"Jun 13, 2014",10/10,"I haven't read the Manga (comic) this is based on, but I can tell you that the movie is very devastating. It also features things that might not be as apparent as they are, especially to western audience members. There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and ""Hammer time"" to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!"
zleverton,"Mar 23, 2006",10/10,"one of the most up-and-coming film makers of the day is one Chanwook Park, an auteur from South Korea who just may go down in the history books as the 21st centuries first great storyteller.Revenge. the word itself denotes a certain tingle on the back of your neck. we all know what it means, some of us have even been a part of it's tangled web. Vengeance is the culmination of almost every emotion the human mind is capable of understanding, and some we don't. Chanwook Park has written, directed and produced three film that tackle the psychology, philosophy and grand theme of vengeance, and Oldboy is the second installment and probably the most important.the story is quite convoluted, and much of it should be left to be witnessed with virgin eyes and ears, but sufficing to say that a sully drunk named Oh Dae Su is captured by a man with a purple umbrella one rainy evening after a few hours in the drunk tank. he is kept in a small motel room with a fake window, a TV, an eerie painting and a gas pipe for the duration of 15 years. during this time, he witnesses his wife and child murdered on the 11 o'clock news, and he is framed for it. Dae Su sort of goes into a slow state of focused madness. his body becomes tough and trained, his hair becomes shaggy and beast-like, and his wrist becomes an hourglass, counting the years in checks until his release. When Dae Su is released, he is no longer Dae su, but something else, he's a beast, a monster, an unstoppable force of vengeance created by the rage and sorrow of the former Dae su. he still looks like the same disheveled 40-something, but there is a deadness to him, a crouching killer waiting to spring on his pray- the people who killed his family and put him in that horrible place, but with all the anger inside Dae Su, there still lurks a very human being, one so desperate for contact with another life after 15 years of deprivation, he consumes a living creature as his first meal upon release. this is only the first half hour of the film, and it's really the simplest part of the plot to explain- a precurser. this should give you an idea of how deep and dark this film plunges into the human psyche. for all it's cartoonish moments and stylish look and feel, Oldboy is unmatched in its well of emotion and deeply human story. you are not asked to take what you see as literal occurrence, but rather to accept what you see and draw meaning from it. there are some scenes many people find obligatory, consciously shocking or just plain gross, but they are all necessary in order to understand the epicness of this tale.on a technical scale, Park has taken a complete divergance from his previous effort- Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and instead gone into a kind of surrealist filmnoir-meets-hong-Kong wonder-world from which this fantastical story can be properly told in the grandios form it requires.a lot of people disliked the ending to this movie, and if you watch this film the same way you watch something like Fight Club or Memento (both fine films) then you wont like it either, but this isn't fight club or memento, this is Shakespeare, this is Homer, this is what lies beneath the gloss and dirt. the core. the story itself is unimportant, it's what the story implies that makes it a masterpiece.i mourn the idea of remaking this film, giving the helm to the man who'll do Fast and the Furious 3, and making the main character go to prison rather than the original mysterious hotel room. all the things that make Oldboy Oldboy are gone, and all we're left with is the homage of someone who obviously missed the point. so i urge you to see this version of the story before it becomes a bastardized memory of itself stuffed into a Pepsi advertisement."
wwwranga,"Aug 22, 2018",10/10,"Amazing movie ,its stays in your memory forever.let's start to watch it and experience a unexpected plot.those who gave a disaster review for this movie definitely they must be get more mature to watch this movie."
gavin6942,"Dec 28, 2011",8/10,"After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must discover the reason for his capture in five days.I am a bit surprised to find this film in the top 250. Not that it is not a good film (it is), but it does not seem like the sort of thing that would get the honor. I suppose, certain plot elements aside, it has incredible cinematography (both in movement and color) and excellent directing. The acting is fine, as well.The violence is hard to categorize. On one hand, some of the bloodiest scenes call to find the films of Takashi Miike. But Miike lacks a certain sensibility that Park does not -- this may be a revenge film, but it is also beautiful in a way. The violence, at times, comes off like a well-scripted choreography. Where Miike tries to shock the audience and push the limits, Park seems content to stay just on the edge and make sure it is done in good form.The biggest problem with this film is that it suffers from the same issue that ""The Sixth Sense"" did. While ""Oldboy"" has many twists and surprises, one of them will probably be told to a viewer before he or she watches the movie. And that is unfortunate. Does it ruin the movie to know twists in advance? Maybe not. But it might be best to have things revealed as the story intends them to be.All in all, a solid film. If I had any complaint, I could say the film was a bit long. But the pacing was steady, so it was not an unenjoyable longness. Not for all audiences, this film should be seen by those who can appreciate it."
bloogrim,"Apr 18, 2005",N/A,"Don't get me wrong. I thought this movie was awesome. The fight scenes were hilarious and Dae-Su's not so desirable appearance made him all the more likable. I only wish that movies made in this country could live up to foreign or even independent films. But alas, that's not how it is. One of the few good things about living in NYC is being able to know and see more things that you wouldn't otherwise see in Smalltownsville, USA.I only wrote all that so my main point can be posted (10 line minimum).The most f*cked up thing for me about this movie was how I felt in the end after getting all worked up about the sex scene in the beginning. I literally wanted to vomit.Thats all.save the whales.-karen"
jonathanrandleff,"Feb 7, 2022",6/10,"Had so much potential, and the build up was great...However, it was so blatantly obvious what the reveal in the end was going to be that it lost all of its drive and purpose...."
buffychik,"Jul 2, 2006",10/10,"I came into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it. My manager said ""buy it, it's AMAZING"". First of all, the plot. After a man has a terribly drunk night, he ends up imprisoned for 15 years without knowing who imprisoned him and why. When he is released, he is given a new suit, a cell phone, and ends up at a sushi restaurant, where he meets Mi-do. Along with Mi-do, to save those he cares about most, Oh-Daesu is given 5 days to figure out who imprisoned him and why. This film definitely focuses on the fact that even the smallest things can blow up out of proportion, and the results can be catastrophic. The acting is by far the best I've seen in Asian cinema, and the writing is fantastic. I highly recommend. 10 stars all the way."
yuenyeeac,"Apr 25, 2020",7/10,"The brutal and almost perverted revenge caused by an unfavorable love is bound to be achieved by causing another unfavorable love. Ignoring the fierce bloody and psychological distortion process for a while, the theme of the film is clearly cleared in a clearer way. This incident of incest is faced with the brave posture of resistance shown by today's powerful ethical and moral system, and some kind of interpersonal crisis of modern people revealed in this stiff and unpretentious posture.
Just as Marquez said in his magical realism masterpiece, the end of incest-a person with a pig tail, modern biological science can also testify to it, incest will lead to deformity of future generations due to the similarity between genes. However, the reason why incest has become a taboo is not such a biological reason. To trace back the history of mankind with the population of the earth today, we can simply make a simple estimate of the population of thousands of years ago or even ancient times, and then we have come up with an impossible number. Such a fact of population growth. This incident proves that incest is not a long-forbidden and rare, but a basic fact of human beings for millions of years. The reason is very simple, it is just a small number of people. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a social organization without incest. Because incest succeeded in preparing the network of in-laws, it enabled the continuation of society, and people in any society without it would be unsustainable.
The birth and reproduction of human beings, from the necessary combination of men and women to family construction to today's monogamy, is a long evolutionary story. From the initial biological, physical, and slowly to the so-called cultural and social evolutionary path of today. One of the basic premises for its realization is the gradual increase in the number of people, so that people no longer have to choose whom to combine from in-laws; at the same time, another more important reason is not fertility distortion, but incest. The disorder caused by human relations makes incest gradually unnecessary and further becomes a taboo.
Therefore, the original primordial incest can actually be generated naturally; now incest has become a problem again. It is actually artificial. The most important thing is of course all kinds of sexual taboo thinking, which causes the so-called sexual repression. Sex has become a shame and even a sinful thing, and the lust can't find an exit. It makes people return to the ancient stone carvings that have only direct blood relatives and only a few heterosexual blood relatives in disguise. . In this way, incest seems to have gone from the ancient ""naturally forced"" occurrence to today's ""artificially forced"" occurrence. And this is the most important reason for the film to be almost invisible but concealed under the modern incest system.
Finally, in the wilderness and snow of the desert, the father realized the detached love with his daughter by choosing to forget. This scene is like the ancient moment when humans are scattered in the earth, but the truth is that this is an extra-legal place free from ethics and social taboos. Love itself is not guilty, even if it is not good, who has hurt it? In fact, it is meaningless to discuss the actual rationality of the ending. It is just a window that condenses the airtight cultural and moral system constructed for modern human civilization, and a buffer that dispels the pressure of the system. Belt for some people who can't bear the burden to take a breath."
dhkdhk,"Jan 25, 2005",9/10,"This is one heck of a film experience, a cinematic joyride unlike any in recent memory. A well-crafted tight package it is, of electrifying acting performance (Choi Min-Sik is simply great), innovative cinematography, unbelievably warped story line, bone-jarring action, black humor, all fortified by a moody and captivating music score(it tends to lodge in the recesses of one's right hemisphere, and won't leave).A role that demands a tremendous emotional range, Choi Min-Sik gives one of the most memorable acting performances in recent years. We see a man brimming with bottled up rage for vengeance barreling his way towards the inevitable encounter with his nemesis, and when the moment arrives, we are witness to a heart-wrenching transformation of a broken man pitifully begging for his mute mercy. If there ever is a measurable scale to the emotional spectrum of acting, then Mr. Choi's performance pushes through the untested limits of infrared and ultraviolet. His brilliantly inscrutable and ambiguously formed sweet-and-sour smile(Mona Lisa would be proud) near the end is the singular summation of a tortured soul who has just been reminded of the unbearable cost of his hollow victory. Perhaps it is the smile beneath which a glimpse of the ""monster"" can still be seen. Many will ponder.Throughout the movie, the viewer is treated to some striking imagery which effectively appear almost embossed onto the film. Some of the more memorable scenes appear to be lifted right out of its dramatic Manga frame composition. Dramatic pose of our protagonist holding back the man and his dog, Mr. Han's momentarily frozen Judo form, the ""Great Wave""(poster) of emotion towering over Dae Su.. There is no stylistic over-byte here, just enough dramatic essence distillation to stick. Simply brilliant. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to the infamous hallway fight scene, an all out, no cuts, make-your-palm-sweat realism. This is largely due to Mr. Park's mastery of his directorial craft to match the subject drama and acting.Those cineastes who like their cinematic Martini ""shaken AND stirred"" will no doubt discover a winding, twisted emotional vista, one that we rarely see. A rock and a grain of sand may sink the same, but surely this cinematic de la creme will ascend to its rightful notice. Indeed a stylistic substance and substantial style."
bsinc,"Aug 26, 2004",9/10,"That's how big an impact ""Oldboy"" made on me! The opening of the movie alone is perhaps the coolest opening I have ever seen because when that music started playing and the first scene starts rolling I was in movie heaven. It was one of those perfect moments I guess, and it was all the much harder to believe, because I am no Asian-movie fan. Actually I avoid Asian movies as much as I can because I don't like their storytelling and directing, plus I never remember the faces because they all look the same. I have, since seeing ""Oldboy"", changed my opinion on that. How could I not, the movie has more style that the first two Matrix movies combined, visual effects that are more than equal rivals to any big-budget Hollywood movie, actors that I was somehow able to recognize were amazing, despite having to read the subtitles all the way through, and a music score that has been playing in my head for many days now. And I haven't even gotten to the true core of this movie. It's a story that blew me away, it's a hardcore revenge movie that won't leave you cold. Put all of this into exactly two hours of pure entertainment at it best, countless memorable scenes that are beyond amazing, and give it a dash of perfection. You got it, an instant cult classic. 9/10"
sebtwister,"Aug 13, 2017",10/10,"I finally re-watched this masterpiece from Park Chan-wook. When it comes to movies about revenge, I have never seen something as effectively shocking as this was. It made me remember why I was so shaken up by this movie the first time I watched it. Nothing can truly prepare you for the kind of deranged story that unfolds in front you.The plot is about Oh Dae-su, a man who is kidnapped and confined to a prison where, with his only form of contact with the outside world being a television where you see someone of the worlds biggest events he missed out on. He also finds out that his wife is murdered and he is framed for it, leaving his daughter orphaned. He is mysteriously released by his captors after 15 years. He is left unaware who did it, why he did it or why he was released. While his life is consumed with revenge, he also falls in love with a young woman who works in a sushi restaurant. When it comes to extreme violence, this is one of those films where I found a lot of it deeply affecting to the point where I was just completely taken out of my comfort zone the first time I watched it. It is razor sharp in terms of its storytelling and it feels so rich because for all the twisted insanity that involves in front of you, it feels impactful in all the right ways. All of the characters, no matter who they are feel like their motivations are handled properly. Oldboy becomes a better movie with every scene, because every plot point that's revealed to you, it is just consistently riveting and I was noticing a few subtle new things on repeat viewings.All of the performances are superb in this and I feel I would have to spoil things if I was talking about everyone, however I will say that I absolutely adored Choi Min-Sik's performance as Oh Dae-su. Everything is revealed to you from his perspective and everything about his performance feels real and believable. He has that wonderful mix where he is just completely deranged and bad ass, while also having down-to-earth vulnerabilities and weaknesses and this makes him easy to connect with as a viewer. It makes everything revealed to you feel so much more meaningful.His fight scenes.... wow! Just wow! How can something so messed up look so beautiful? The famous hallway scene one of best fight scenes I have ever seen put to film and it is just staggering to me how perfect it looks. It's not so much the martial arts that looks impressive, it's the fact that the film isn't afraid to make the fighting a little raw and sloppy at times which makes for a visceral and painful looking scene. Seeing Oh Dae-su with a switchblade stuck in his back for most of the scene just has me grimacing. And to top of that it is filmed in a beautiful extended long tracking shot. As badass as he is in this film Choi Min-Sik also gives a wonderful physical performance and he looks like he is in pain.... a lot. He sells a character who only has one thing left to fight for in his life and that is revenge and you feel his desperation for it.The music in this film is just beautiful. The use of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons to someone's teeth getting pulled is so indescribably twisted, I just love it! That piece will probably haunt me whenever I go to the dentist now. The rest of the soundtrack is so beautiful it almost brings me to tears listening to it by itself. Jo Yeoung- wook and Shim Hyun-Jung's classical score feels very contrasting to the visuals, and just feels so tragic and melancholic. The last track called The Last Waltz, is one of the most beautiful pieces in the film and just has me deep in thought as I'm meditating and processing everything that has just happened in the film.I also appreciate how you get a few darkly funny moments in there as well. There's one scene early on, while Oh Dae-su is still held prisoner, where he decides to write a list of people who he think might be motivated enough to do something like that to him and he ends up filling up an entire journal of it. There's a few little moments like that where you see humour like that just sprinkled in and I love that. I simply have to see more films from Park Chan-wook, because in my opinion he is one of the best filmmakers of all time. It's both beautiful and brutal to watch at the same and it's just one of those films that held my attention from start to finish. It is such a riveting experience, that the 2 hours just fly by and it's shocking ending makes the film linger on long after it's over. It's a great story where you end up buying into every characters motivations no matter how you look at it and that's what makes Oldboy a truly special experience. I loved every minute of this."
akpvt,"Aug 26, 2025",10/10,"The movie is simply a masterpiece that you would watch once and recommend to others forever. Remember those moments when a movie leaves you flabbergasted and traumatized ? You are lucky to have found another one of those movies. It's called ""Oldboy"". If you have watched ""the Prestige"" by Christopher Nolan and enjoyed it then consider it a ""Prestige on steroids""(a compliment) . The direction, the story , the philosophy and the narration is simply top notch. The movie has some very questionable elements and that's actually the whole point of this movie. The last 30 minutes to the movie is the epotome of absolute cinema. It reminds you about why you love movies and why you search relentlessly for good cinema. It's also one of the most fkd up things you will ever see so get excited."
M_VanGemert,"Jun 26, 2010",9/10,"Yes a shout to all people who reads and posts or votes on IMDb. Because you guys make sure I get to watch movies that are awesome. If it wasn't for IMDb I would have probably missed out on many,many and many more movies, including: Oldboy.When it comes to foreign films I used to be very skeptical. Why? Well most movies I watched when I was young where from Hollywood. But once you really 'open your eyes' you'll see that there are so many great movies not from the movie-factory;Hollywood. like: The Green Butchers, Adam's apples, Oorlogswinter, Grave of the fireflies, Spirited away and not sure but the kite runner. Anyway I think I could make a bigger list but then I wouldn't have time or enough lines to talk about Oldboy.Oldboy starts of very funny. It doesn't really fit the rest of the film but its a great starter. Then it does seem to change drastically. I won't go in detail since I don't want to spoil anything. But every movie has a certain feel to it. The way you feel, like a taste on your tongue, keeps you entertained or not, simple as that. This movie has a very unique feel to it which I haven't seen or felt before. You get really attached to the main character which makes you put aside your own feelings of 'right and wrong' and condone fighting/killing etc.This movie has everything you would expect from a movie. complicated characters but understandable, a unique storyline, love in a special way and twists and turns. But this movie shall never reach the top, as in a score 9+. Why? Because its not a movie every person would want to watch. Some scenes are very ...'special'.Conclusion: Unique movie that is awesome in many many ways but not one to watch with friends or family that wouldn't understand these kind of movies."
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 29, 2008",N/A,"Oldboy (2003)*** 1/2 (out of 4)After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man has five days to learn what it was all about and seek revenge on those behind it. I've only seen director Chan-wook Park's Three...Extremes before this here but I'm certainly going to be seeking more out. As with the other film, the ""wow"" moment in this one here is worth everything that comes before it and makes your jaw just hit the floor. I'm not sure if others caught onto what was going on but I thought I did. I thought I knew the whole story of why he was kidnapped and why that certain man wanted revenge but when that twists come...nothing prepared me for that. Min-sik Choi was terrific in the film as was the supporting players. I also liked the fact that the director mixed in lots of humor even with all the over the top violence and that shocking twist at the end."
eshwarmail,"Jul 24, 2016",7/10,"It is one of those movies where you can neither guess the reason for the revenge nor the actual end play (by midway). Definitely the emphasis is on style over substance, glorifying goriness than the emotional connect and acting is definitely not its strong suite. Despite its emotional and language barriers, it is a victory for movie making by having a stranglehold on audience attention up until 90% of the movie.Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is a careless drunk and has rubbed many people the wrong way. On his daughter's birthday, he is abducted and put in a room without giving a reason for the cause. He is put in an independent room of an apartment without any scope for a conversation except for a television, mostly drugged, fed the same duck dumpling and occasionally visited by a hypnotist. As he prepares himself by learning boxing and other martial arts from what he can gather from television to extract revenge on the person who might have done this to him and also digging a tunnel in parallel for his escape, one fine day he is let off after 15 years. Can he do what he has been preparing for?It is a captivating premise to be imprisoned without knowing the reason and source while also keeping the audience in the same state of ignorant mind as the protagonist. This establishes an empathy from the audience who will embark on a journey with the protagonist till the end of story (or the reveal). As the hype builds up over a period of time, it cannot be fizzled out with a run-of-the-mill reason and that's where the story kicks into another least expected dimension. All the loopholes and misfires are temporarily forgotten and we change to the new ride and hop along with a renewed interest which again acts in the movie's favor.A special mention should go to Ji-tae Yu who plays the character Woo-jin Lee, he does it with such elan that makes you think that you are not just seeing a good vs. evil story. The story and screenplay is well thought out and executed that greatly influences how the editing eventually turns out. While the boldness of the content is surely to be appreciated in a mainstream cinema, the way it ends is what emphasizes the grayness of the human mind. A classic generally attributes to how the audience reacted to it rather than how well it is made, in that aspect Oldboy definitely is a cult classic that overcomes the goofy acting, uneven scenes and continuity issues to become something that is much more.Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride."
psgorio,"Dec 28, 2024",7/10,"Outlandish, bizarre and downright disturbing at times are the best words I can use to describe this Korean action drama. It's about a man held in captivity for 15 years for some odd reason and once he's let out he is out for revenge but man does it take some length to get there through some very disturbingly confusing and downright awkward scenes. I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it wastes a lot of the audience's time with filler scenes, but then expects it to all be paid off by the wild twist of an ending that is supposed to make up for the rest of the film, but to me just feels kind of too little too late. Especially the context behind the twist really makes it all the more worse. Yes it's shock and awe inspired twist, but at the same time that doesn't excuse it for what it is on paper which is a vastly degrading thing to have committed even if it was something beyond your control and having to live with doing such an act or dying just makes it more cringe worthy. But I do respect the film for doing what it did, even though I didn't enjoy what the outcome was for the most part. It does have some big fat hairy balls for doing what I did though. And I can't fault it for that. But I can't fault it for is the bloated two hour run time when this probably could've been wrapped up in a little over 90 minutes. Lastly, what I did enjoy most of all was this one hallway fight scene that was very reminiscent of the Daredevil series hallway fight scene mixed in with a little bit of a Yakuza video game fight feel. Overall, Oldboy is an odd duck but a duck that has some interesting moments a couple of entertaining ones and a heck of a lot of wickedly disturbing and cringe ones. If you're all about the cringe though this will be right up your alley. But if you're like me and you only dabble in cringe, then I would spend my time watching something a little less funky."
jens-linden,"Feb 8, 2005",3/10,"After having suffered through the major part of this film, I finally stood up and walked out of the theater. And mark my words, that's the first time I did that. With that not said that it's the worst film I've ever seen at the cinemas, but first there are the regular bad films and then there are the films that really overwhelm you in their surprising amount of empty meaninglessness. I was apparently misled by the great praise this movie has been given here in Sweden by reviewers that I normally trust, not to mention the award in Cannes.The film does not work at any level, with a possible exception for the settings and the suggestive coloring. All I could see was a repugnant protagonist that stumbles from one out-of-place and pointless scene to another, maybe he was out to have his revenge on somebody, or maybe was he just adding to the confused and weak script with his own confusing actions, it does'nt really matter since the film did'nt really communicate anything substantial at all."
jamesomullane,"Feb 9, 2020",10/10,"Chan-wook Park's twisted masterpiece was my first introduction into the world of foreign language films. I couldn't believe how refreshing it felt to watch this unique and original work of pure genius. This film opened a door for me into some incredible productions from around the globe. The downright audacious writing is admirable, throwing the blueprint away and coming up with this amazing revenge story, told in a smart and powerful manner. I reckon that the mountain of revenge films that have come out in the last while owe this film a debt of gratitude. The cinematography, soundtrack and choreography are all something special, as is the acting, notably from Min-sik Choi. His exhaustion from this demanding role actually shows in some scenes. The less known about this film on first viewing, the better. Letting the story unfold the way the filmmakers intended is what really gives this great film its power"
warlordzephyr,"Jul 6, 2012",10/10,"This is by a noticeable margin, the best film I have ever seen. I am a film enthusiast rather than a serious critic, but despite never having written a review before I felt compelled to write this. Quite a few reviews of this film have given it a 1 out of 10. This is absurd, all such ratings can be dismissed as the nonsensical ramblings of those who claim to be enlightened but are nothing more than the sort of people who disagree with you just to sound intelligent.At the end of this film I fell in love with it, the deliberately flawed characters, the eclectic directing, the soundtrack, everything. The romance is neither naive nor cynical, the action is realistic (even capturing the occasional absurdity of fighting) and the characters are some of the best written I have ever seen (Oh Dae Su can be compared to a Shakespearian antagonist).You need to watch this film, it will chance your perception of everything for the better."
svolyaee,"Aug 18, 2023",10/10,"Oldboy is a puzzling masterpiece that deeply submerges viewers in a jaw-breaking tale of revenge, redemption, and the intricate interplay of human morality. Rooted in the depths of moral psychology, the film takes its audience on a hair raising though agonizing journey that scrutinizes the complexities of ethical decision-making, the consequences of our actions, and the blurred lines between right and wrong or morality and immorality.The film narrates an excruciating exploration of the aftereffects of vengeance. The protagonist, Oh Dae-su, becomes a pawn in a twisted game of retribution, setting off a chain of events that challenge the very fabric of his moral compass. As the narrative unfolds, the audience is hardly slapped with the question: Can the pursuit of revenge ever be morally justified? The film provides no easy answers, prompting viewers to grapple with the intricate nuances of justice and the ethical implications of one's desires.In fact, Old Boy presents moral psychology through the characters' motivations and actions. Oh Dae-su's relentless quest for retribution leaves us no choice but to question the limits of empathy and compassion. His single-minded pursuit shows the darker aspects of human nature, revealing the depths to which an individual can descend when consumed by vengeance. This transformation is a testament to the instability of morality under extreme circumstances and the precariousness of our ethical foundations.The apparently antagonist character of Lee Woo-jin, adds another layer of moral complexity. His calculated actions challenge conventional notions of right and wrong, pushing the boundaries of moral relativism. The film invites us to examine the rationale behind his elaborate scheme, blurring the line between villain and victim, and shedding light on the intricate motivations that drive his actions. Oldboy also raises the profound question of redemption. As the narrative reaches its climactic moments, the film explores whether individuals can truly atone for their past transgressions. Oh Dae-su's journey towards self-discovery becomes a poignant exploration of moral growth and the possibility of finding absolution, even in the face of unthinkable deeds.Park Chan-wook's flawless direction and the performances of the cast create a hauntingly immersive experience, leaving audiences super shocked and contemplative long after the films ends. As we journey alongside Oh Dae-su through his odyssey of revenge, redemption, and moral reckoning, we are compelled to confront our own moral convictions, challenging us to reflect on the fragile and intricate nature of our ethical compasses."
sushiholic,"Mar 14, 2020",10/10,One of the best movies ever made. Still haven't changed my mind. Watch it.
KnightsofNi11,"Oct 7, 2010",10/10,"Oh. My. God. If you ever thought a movie twisted the fabric of your mind as to what is and isn't possible in this modern world of cinema, watch Oldboy and I'm sure it will surpass all your previous notions. Chan-wook Park is a Korean director who specializes in incredible stylistic camera work and artistic cinematography within a carefully constructed narrative. Oldboy is the second film in his aptly named ""vengeance trilogy."" It is about a man who is imprisoned 15 years for unknown reasons. After enduring painful loneliness for all this time, he is released, only to find out he has five days to find out why he was imprisoned. It starts off strange and different, yet don't get discouraged. Everything echoes throughout the film to end with one of the most twisted and stunning climaxes I have ever witnessed. My jaw was left wide open for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and then about ten more after the credits finished rolling. If it hadn't been so late I might have hit the play button again as soon as I made it back to the DVD menu. It was utterly mind blowing.I was most definitely not prepared going into this film, but it only served to heighten the experience of watching this practically perfect film. Oldboy hits the ground running and within five minutes of the film we get an incredible taste for what Chan-wook Park's filmmaking is all about. It's fast. It's fun. But it's also smart. Amidst the vibrant colors and the beautiful cinematography there is an incredible narrative. As the mystery of this film unravels we are pulled farther and farther in. And of course at the end of the film it just explodes in our faces without hardly any warning. You will be amazed. You will be disturbed. It will most definitely catch you off guard. It was all so expertly done and I just couldn't avert my eyes for one second in fear of missing the mysterious grandeur of this film. Every moment and every character serves the plot to some avail. There isn't a moment in Oldboy that felt unnecessary or overdone. It's one of the brilliantly made films which comes full circle by the end, only wanting you to rewind and watch the whole thing over again, immediately. I can't come up with enough words to describe how awesome this story is. It is definitely one of those you absolutely must see for yourself.I'm sure it's a ballsy statement to make, but Chan-wook Park could be the next Akira Kurosawa, only this time slightly more hardcore, obviously. Every shot of Oldboy is so incredibly crafted, down to the most finite detail. The entire film is handled with such care and precaution, and the results are astounding. There are moments in the film which resonate the style of other master directors. There are multiple shots in the film which are heavily Scorsese influenced, for example. However, there is still an extremely definitive style here which belongs to Park. This style is what prevails over any of the specific influences scattered throughout the film. If Park continues to make films like this he will most likely go down in history as one of the genius auteurs of the 21st century. However, on that same note I would be amazed if he ever made anything that could top Oldboy.Oldboy is one of those films which you will never be able to get out of your head. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you, but to me it was a great thing. It's a one of a kind film which could never recreated in it's full glorious essence. There was once talk of an American remake of this film, and I'm not sure I could have stomached that, knowing for a fact that any American team could never top the demented perfection of the original. Oldboy is utterly incredible. Every moment is perfect. It gets everything right and goes farther than you could ever imagine. The best part is that Oldboy doesn't fall into one specific genre of film, making it an example of how practically any film should be made, in essence. It would be a crime to go through life never seeing this film."
akkoziol,"Oct 6, 2008",9/10,"Wow, I can't believe some crybaby removed my comment. What's wrong, does the 1st Amendment offend you? First, let me get this off my chest. A lot of people either love this movie or hate it with a passion. The ones who love it are the one's who choose to give something a chance, have an open mind, and already know the best stuff is being made outside the US. The ones who hate this movie well, never mind, it's not worth filling up this space. I did like this movie a lot. Liked it when I first got introduced to it in 2003 by friends in Korea and I still feel it holds up to most movies in its genre. The story in summary is explained by others who've posted review and synopses of the plot so go there to read it but to compare this to Count of Monte Cristo is a bit dumb. Maybe if you stretched it you can see the comparison but come on, seriously? Fans of go-for-broke revenge plots in the vein of Seven will love this movie as it is the closest thing to it. Certainly it has some plot elements that are going to make American audiences squirm but it is a Korean movie not an American movie. Don't be detracted by the people who've given this such negative reviews. It's VERY raw and sometimes brutal but it is a revenge movie at its core. Also, I don't know what ""gore"" people are referring to in this movie as there is no gore. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is gore. Brutality yes, gore? Hardly. Tarantino wished he could have directed this movie, 'nuff said. This movie rightly deserves it's rating."
darimoviesthoughtsoffilms,"Jun 23, 2022",N/A,"I recently watched Oldboy for the first time, and I can already say that it's one of the best films I've seen. Instead of being your average revenge film, this film focuses on the consequences of revenge over the act itself. The action is amazing, especially the hallway scene, which might've inspired Daredevil's season 1 sequence quite a bit. The story is twisted and horrific, but I wouldn't have it any other way. This is just an amazing movie overall, and if you think you can handle more than what Hollywood films usually contain, you're in for a ride."
gbill-74877,"Mar 6, 2020",7/10,"Absolutely brilliant in its first few scenes (and a damn good first hour), which set the tone for a wild ride and showcase director Park Chan-wook's impressive visual flair. The mystery of what's happening to this guy is intriguing, and as he himself tries to figure out, we get a very creative fight scene in the corridor (among lots of other things, cough, octopus). It's no wonder Tarantino liked this film so much, as its main theme is revenge, it goes for those big, squirm-inducing shock moments, and it's quite stylish. For me it fizzled a bit in the second half, as I saw more of the nemesis character and the story was revealed. Much as I tried to suspend disbelief (and not think too much about the misogyny), several big moments in the plot seemed contrived, and it seemed kind of messy, wanting focus. Still entertaining though, if you're in the mood for something dark."
kumarsaurabhhhhhh,"Oct 28, 2023",10/10,"I am puzzled even after 20 years it hit like an stong old monk great movie beyond words loved it hated it thankyou for making such a great movie one point of view which i understand in this movie may be it is my bias , but it is when a rich person do wrong things it looks good we want him to do bad, even bad is good from rich person, may be someone who can full fill all our wildest desire, the concept of wrong and right is dissolved, another point of view is death we need to accept it is part of life it will come one day where I body mind level will be dissolved and the worrier will also be dissolved when in real when death will come the worrier will dissolve.. what will be left is exactly what we actually are we can experience it right now also that's the highest possibility of an human being."
lastrada151515,"Mar 15, 2005",5/10,"I have watched this movie with great hopes. I am a movie buff, I love Italian cinema - Fellini, Antonioni, Rosselini, de Sica -, but I'm also open to many other cultures with their works. As I really LOVE Korean food, I hoped I could say the same about the movie hailed as the Second Coming in some circles. It wasn't meant to be, so please spare me the senseless innuendos about anybody calling this bad movie a bad movie being anti-Asian or whatever. I am anti-being-robbed-of-my-hard-earned-money, yes.Yes, I can see how for somebody ready to believe that an MTV video is the greatest (or the ""coolest"") music they've ever heard Oldboy can seem a ""masterpiece"". But that's really stretching the latter term far beyond a benevolent attitude toward pop culture, more likely toward a mindless ""anything goes"" attitude.By the way, without giving any spoilers, the plot is not ""original"", ""stunning"", or whichever other inapt superlatives the easy-to-please crowd bestowed upon this half-wit of a movie. It's at most an inflation of unbelievable and at times downright stupid twists which make no sense and bring no elation, cathartic or otherwise, in the viewer doomed to be submitted to this ""masterpiece"". Run for your life."
TwoThirdsMajority,"Apr 29, 2007",9/10,"When i first saw Oldboy back in 2004, i was just 13 years old. I watched it with my girlfriend at the cinemas just couple of hours after watching Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't enjoy it that much, but the film does make my girlfriend cry. However, i do like the dialog between Daesu and Woojin, as well as the corridor fight scene.Three years later Oldboy came back to the spotlight. During the recent shootings at the Virginia Tech Institute, Fox News and Sky News claimed that Oldboy inspired the killer Cho Seng Hui to commit crimes. I wasn't much convinced by the news reports, and so i picked up a DVD of Oldboy at the store and try to link this film with the shooter. Because if i remember, this film doesn't have the GTA-style violence that will encourage people to commit violence.Unfortunately, i was right. This film is not that GTA violent at all. And it has only one gun shown at the film. However the good part is that it made me love the film more. Why? Because it made me appreciate the story, the feel, the romance and the tragedy of the film. I'm not really used to Korean cinema, but this film just blew me away.The story of this film tells about Oh Daesu, a man who was sent to the police station on the day of his daughter's birthday. He was bailed by his friend Joo Hwan. However, just as he was to apologize to his daughter on the payphone, he was kidnapped, and was sent to a room with nothing but a television, a toilet and a bed for 15 years.After 15 years, he escaped. He became unfamiliar with the outside world that he hasn't knew for a long time. During the time he was in that room, his only link with the outside world was the television. And he became familiarized with computers and cell phones, thanks to television.However, his world changed. He was accused of murdering his wife while on that room, and his daughter was sent to Sweden. Desperate to know why he was imprisoned for 15 years, he sets out for revenge, hoping to look for the man responsible for imprisoning him in that room.What i like about this film is that it has the brilliance mix of Scorcese combined with a Tarantino-ish dialog and some neo-noir backgrounds. Even if it's not an English film, but it is a film that will appeal to many. The directing was probably the most brilliant piece of artwork you'll see in a film. One scene has Daesu fighting a group of thugs in a corridor, and that scene is taken with one shot, which makes the whole scene look like a painting.So is this film good? Of course it is. Sure there's some sex and nudity, and you'll need to read subtitles to enjoy this film, but the violence? Not that heavy. It's just only teeth removal, tongue cutting and a fight scene between a man and 30 gangsters. It shouldn't be blamed for matters like Virginia Tech shootings. However, if you're looking for a deep & thought-provoking film with touches of Tarantino & Scorcese in it, then look no further than Oldboy."
Det_McNulty,"Jul 9, 2006",9/10,"I personally feel Oldboy is the best film to come out of Asian cinema, it really hit me hard. I loved it from start to finish, this dark tale of revenge is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had. Everything about Oldboy is perfect, the direction, the poetic screenplay, the haunting operatic score and the wonderful acting. Even though Oldboy is a tale of revenge, it has an underlying message of redemption.I mean how can you feel sorry for someone when you don't know what they have done. You see Oldboy questions the viewer, you will falter between feeling sorry for someone and then wondering ""But what did they do to make that person do such a thing?"" The film tests what many viewers can handle, even though the film is disturbing it adds a touch of twisted humour. Chan-wook Park is a director with a lot of talent, he mixes genres perfectly and many different techniques used to create a dark foreboding atmosphere.The dialogue is poetic, deep and meaningful. The phrase ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you, weep, and you weep alone"" is a very true statement. It's the kind of dialogue where you want to sit back and think about it for a second because everything moves with great pacing. The movie is deep and fulfilling. It holds many surprise twists and turns and uses some great shock techniques.The film mixes genres together, mainly using revenge and drama. The movie studies humanity and how a person can hurt someone without realising it. I would say this masterpiece is very psychological because it tests the viewers boundaries of what they can handle in certain places. The movie has a very comic book feel to it because it's based of a Manga series as well as being part of the ""Vengance Trilogy"". The movie helps define the often used term of ""cool"".Oldboy stands high up in a class of it's own, the movie is visual beauty and shows the pain that the characters are going through. The edging menace that weaves it's way throughout the film manages to keep the viewer watching and grasping for more. Oldboy is a film that sticks with you and plays on your mind for a long time after each viewing. The movie is very deep and manages to show things through ""In your face"" technique and subtle imagery through acting. Another genius aspect would be the way you can't really decide who's the bad person is, there are definitely no good characters apart from Dae-su Oh's lover who acts powerfully and with lots of precision.For example one of the great scenes in this masterpiece is the love scene, it shows all the pain Dae-su Oh is going through. The actor Min-sik Choi has been casted perfectly and plays his role as Dae-su Oh with sublime brilliance. The direction is stylish and different, the movie experiments with very clever camera techniques. An example would be the close up of Dae-su Oh in the right hand corner of the screen and the blurred image of someone behind him. Oldboy is an extremely intelligent style of film making that is for a viewer who wants to get something out of the movie they are watching.The movie is somewhat like a Film-Noir, the narration adds depth and powerhouse style to the films undertone. Hence the idea of revenge and telling the tale of something that asks the viewer questions. The movie plays with the mind and twists everything you once thought was correct. The viewer never knows who to trust or what is going to happen next. he movie is unpredictable and feels like a poem of death. The first 40 minutes or so build up a claustrophobic atmosphere. The film shows how our society and class we live in is fuelled by evil.The movie is far from being at action movie and some might say far from being a revenge movie. It's more about lost love, self indulgence and finding inner tranquillity. The acting as mentioned is very powerful and provokes the viewer to ask the one main question that the film offers and that's ""Why?""Another important aspect would be ""Insanity"" and ""What drives a human? What really makes them want to go out and do something?"" Some viewers will be put off from the films high-octane style and grace. But mainly the fact the movie is very twisted and disturbing. Though the added touch of satire adds a crazed ambition. The film actually feels quite Quentin Tarantino like in certain places or at least something that would appeal to his taste in film. The film is unflinching with it's camera use and what is being put fourth in front of the viewer.Perfection, detail and sublime visual flare makes this one of the greatest films ever made. You'll be wanting to see Oldboy again and again as soon as it finishes. The movie is confusing and fulfilling with it's wonderfully sweeping plot line. There is no doubt about it, Oldboy is one of the greatest films of the 21st century."
ebossert,"Apr 11, 2006",10/10,"Oldboy is a fine movie. In reading some of the negative reviews on IMDb, however, one may be given the impression that this film is gratuitous in its use of violence and sex. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who have seen this film understand that the sex scene was an important  even ESSENTIAL  event. (This is, mind you, the only movie I can think of that has been able to utilize sex as a significant contribution to a well-crafted storyline.) Thus, the sex was not gratuitous at all, since it served a purpose that becomes all the more obvious as the story progresses. If one wishes to see gratuitous sexual content that adds virtually nothing to a horribly-crafted storyline, one can refer to Izo (directed by Takashi Miike).With regards to those complaining about the film's believability, they are simply attacking a strawman. And I ponder at why these very same criticisms of believability are not applied to such overrated films like The Lord of the Rings or ET. Perhaps because the priority of such films are not in their presentation of believable concepts? In like manner, this film's purpose is to express the consequences implicit within the pursuit of vengeance. Whether or not the events therein are believable or not is inconsequential. Thus, the criticism of unbelievability is logically flawed, and pointless.I have always held that making a film extreme  in and of itself  does not make a good movie. (And I have seen plenty of low quality extreme movies.) That said, there are both bad and good extreme films. With its engaging storyline and entertainment value, Oldboy is an unequivocal example of the latter."
Green_Lantern_482,"Jan 28, 2005",10/10,"In Oldboy Choi Min-Shik (of Shiri fame) plays Dae-su, a man kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years in a single room apartment, before being released and given 5 days to discover the reason for his imprisonment. Okay, so you know the basic premise of this film. What is hard to convey is the sheer excellence of the performances in this film, or the artistically intriguing camera shots or even the absorbing nature of this intriguing thriller. Every scene looks stunning, the lighting and sets seem perfect from the drab prison walls that actually make you feel ill, to the cold steel of the office building with its clean lines and vapid design. Great care and attention has been taken when planning this film, and it shows. Park Chan-Wook deserves much acclaim for his direction and sheer effort in bringing this film to screen. The plot is also intriguing yet not overly complex and the pace of the film is punctuated by scenes of extreme violence which are somewhat disturbing, but never gratuitous when balanced against the nature of the world Dae-su has descended into. But all of the sets and direction only gain cachet when placed next to the performances of the two main players; Choi Min-Shik (who is simply astounding in probably his best role to date) and Yu Ji-Tae (from the enjoyable Korean horror/thriller Into the Mirror). Both men put in staggering performances of particularly extreme characters without seeming too grandiose. This baroque thriller is simply not to be missed by any fan of thrillers or Asian cinema. Yet I would warn those who have issues with screen violence and somewhat disturbing subject matter to look elsewhere. But all in all, I hold this film up as a true masterpiece, and unquestionably one of the best thrillers to be made yet."
jwr-davis,"Aug 13, 2007",8/10,"Don't let that title fool you (or the reviews from people that don't understand genre)this horrifying revenge thriller from Korea's dark maestro Park Chan-wook, who gave us the wonderful Sympathy for Mr Vengeance is making the British and American offerings in this genre look pretty quaint. Oldboy has touches of Kafka, and echoes of British paranoia thrillers like The Ipcress File and The Prisoner. But it opens up a whole new sicko frontier of exotic horror, and more or less reduced my intestines to guacamole both times I watched it, not so much with its violence - although heaven knows there's a super-sized helping of that - but with a queasily ingenious imprisonment-torture impossible to contemplate without a prickling of cold sweat.Oldboy certainly shows that it's Asia where the farthest reaches of extreme cinema are to be found, and the worst nightmare is that 15 years in prison, which leaves the numbed viewer wondering if that is an unspeakably long time - or perhaps an unspeakably short time in the nihilist wasteland Park conjures up. ""What happens after you've revenged yourself?"" wonders Dae-su. ""I bet the hidden pain will come back."" This is cinema that holds an edge of cold steel against your throat."
saadbaghdad,"Jun 15, 2020",10/10,This to me is the greatest film ever made by far. It's perfect their is nothing wrong with it at all.
JurijFedorov,"Dec 30, 2009",9/10,"This movie is hyped and usually i don't like movies that are not American, I hate the fact that you don't understand what the actors are saying and therefore don't have that much empathy for them. I watched this movie to see what all the hype was about and to prove myself right for thinking that Asian movies are stupid. So I wanted to notice all the bad things in this movie.I was proved wrong, this movie is awesome, the directing and acting is some of the best I have ever seen and the story is UNIQUE. This movie is like American History X and Fight Club, but it does not suffer from Hollywood-syndrome and makes these to films look like kid movies.You will never see anything like this movie anywhere else."
heptaparaparshinokh,"Jan 31, 2005",10/10,"The writer, cinematographer and director, as well as to a large extent, the lead actor, create a cinematic world unlike any other captured on film. In particular, there are two scenes in this movie that will go down in history as being completely original and masterful in execution. There are some minor things that you could complain about if you really wanted to, but other elements of the film are so brilliant that you probably won't even notice. To give any of the story away would be a travesty, so make sure to avoid any trailers or reviews - this is meant to be watched with no knowledge of the subject. A solid ten."
ranajit-61,"Jul 31, 2025",8/10,"Oldboy is one of the most shocking films I've ever seen.The plot is deeply disturbing but insanely gripping.Choi Min-sik delivers a raw, unforgettable performance.It's violent, emotional, and psychologically intense.The direction is bold and unapologetic.You'll feel uncomfortable-but you won't look away.Not your usual revenge thriller.Watch it if you're ready to be emotionally wrecked.An unforgettable masterpiece that haunts you long after."
zabalmsm,"Jul 11, 2020",7/10,"""Oldboy"" stands as a cinematic enigma, offering a plot that is undeniably different and capable of keeping audiences hooked from the beginning. However, beneath the surface of its unique narrative lies a film that can be described as nothing short of disturbing.The storyline takes unexpected turns, creating a gripping atmosphere of mystery and suspense. The unconventional plot is a departure from conventional narratives, and its ability to keep viewers intrigued is commendable. The film delves into the psyche of its characters, presenting a dark and haunting exploration of human nature.However, the overall impact of ""Oldboy"" can be overshadowed by its disturbing elements. The film doesn't shy away from visceral and unsettling scenes, leaving a lasting impression that extends beyond the screen. The visceral nature of the narrative may prove to be a divisive factor, with some viewers finding it difficult to reconcile with the film's darker aspects.While the movie is undoubtedly a unique piece of cinema, its disturbing content can overshadow its storytelling brilliance for some audiences. It's a challenging watch that elicits a range of emotions, from fascination to discomfort.In conclusion, ""Oldboy"" is a film that demands attention for its distinctiveness and ability to keep viewers engaged with its unusual plot. However, the overall experience is marked by a sense of discomfort and unease, making it a movie that may not be suitable for everyone. If you're prepared for a dark and challenging journey into the human psyche, ""Oldboy"" offers a unique cinematic experience, but be forewarned of its potential to leave you with a sense of unease."
christian-tesfaye,"Jul 26, 2013",10/10,"If i were you i would see this movie as fast as possible before the Spike Lee version comes out and the movie is sodomized. It's not hard to tell, from the movie's poster, that it is going to be same thing. It isn't because i hate Spike Lee or something, it is because i don't believe the movie could be made to be as good as this one. I would also recommend knowing as little as possible about the story of the movie before watching it.this is one of the best foreign language movies i have ever seen my entire life. the movie has a plot that is to die for and the last revelation would either amuse or give you a heart attack. The most engrossing thing about it is that it doesn't shock by using violence or unnecessary amount of gore but with a beautifully put together plot."
Tostig66,"Jan 29, 2024",7/10,"I saw this for the first time the same week I watched Battle Royale. With the other movie, it's very high concept and very violent, but I much preferred it.The issue with oldboy is there is an intriguing mystery in the middle of all of this. Why has he been locked up for 15 years? It's a great conceit, but the payoff, personally for me, doesn't work.The films violence is so heightened it shares more in common with Battle Royale than it does with a great drama. And yet despite the ridiculousness of the central character and the overall plot, nobody is having any fun. Everybody is very serious and the climax for me was overblown melodrama which I didn't believe at all.The direction is incredible, the very famous scenes are quite rightly highly regarded. But it's quite a long movie for quite a slight idea which you either go with or don't. This movie clearly isn't for everyone it didn't work for me - you have been warned."

vishaal811,"May 21, 2015",9/10,"Before seeing this movie, I had come across Oldboy in a number of lists where it was mentioned as one of the most violent and disturbing films you will ever see. On that count, it does not disappoint. It is a chilling depiction of a man who has been imprisoned for 15 years without knowing the reason for this punishment. The performance of Chao Min Sik is absolutely phenomenal. By portraying Oh Dae-Su, he completely owns the role and shows the desperation and want for revenge effortlessly. This is not a film for the weak-hearted as it contains several scenes of graphic violence which can't be handled by everyone. A must-watch for all cinema-lovers, this one can definitely rival the best movies that have come out of Asia. Apart from the disturbing imagery that is omnipresent in this movie, it's hard to find any flaw in this masterpiece which might go down in history as one of the best. A must watch."
puyiyi-41964,"Oct 3, 2021",8/10,Very enjoyable! One of the great filmmaker of our time. The acting is amazing. It's rarely to see a film so over the top but yet so believable.
ba_mhd17,"Oct 27, 2023",10/10,"Oldboy, the Korean film directed by Park Chan-wook, is an extraordinary cinematic achievement with a unique topography that's both visually and narratively stunning.The movie's visual topography, brought to life by Chung Chung-hoon's brilliant cinematography, captures the gritty beauty of Seoul with both elegance and brutality. Notably, the iconic hammer fight scene, shot in a single take, is a testament to the film's technical prowess.Narratively, Oldboy's topography is a winding maze of suspense, moral complexity, and emotional depth. It follows Oh Dae-su, played by Choi Min-sik, on a quest for revenge that leads to unexpected twists and a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche.The film's thematic topography delves into the dark side of humanity, challenging the audience's moral compass with its examination of vengeance and obsession.Cho Young-wuk's haunting musical score perfectly complements the film's topography, enhancing its atmosphere and emotions.In summary, Oldboy is a cinematic treasure that immerses viewers in a unique topographical journey through the complexities of the human experience. Park Chan-wook's masterpiece is an essential entry in the world of cinema, leaving an indelible mark on film history."
anshulsainihwr,"Jul 29, 2024",7/10,"The plot twist screwed my mental health pretty well for sure, but it was not like i did not saw it coming. The makers does a good job of hiding the final curtain reveal at the end but if you know anything about drama thrillers you will see it coming maybe not to the weird extent which it actually goes to. Also I feel that the most pop-culture fame oldboy gets is mostly for its absurdity. The scene perspectives & cinematography were really creative but it lacked on story. Using hypnosis so casually on normal people for taking years long revenue just feels very convenient plot device to fill gap."
brittanylongtine,"Sep 18, 2022",10/10,"I cannot find any faults in this movie. Everything from the story, the acting, the cinematography, the soundtrack, everything is perfection.This film does what other try to do...it doesn't insist upon itself nor dose it treat the viewer as an idiot.It shows the viewer the information you need to know through the dialogue and actions of the characters.It is a mystery which is up to you to unsolve, however, it drops clues and innuendos, and does it masterfully.This is a film every film maker should study and interpret, as there is no better film out there.The story is captivating and provocative.The twist will blow your mind.The motives of the characters are masterfully unraveled in a gut wrenching, soul searching way.I was completely glued to the screen, wanting to know the end game, and anticipating the next move.It has one of the best choreographed fight signs in all of cinema.The main character is relatable in a way that I haven't experienced in cinema before.I even had sympathy for the antagonist.The supporting characters are interesting and at times comical, and I loved every second of this movie,.The ending is unlike anything I have ever seen, and this movie honestly left me speechless.I have since compared every movie to this one, and nothing comes close.This is truly a masterpiece, and deserves so much more credit than it gets.This is my favorite movie of all time, and if you are fortunate enough to watch it, consider yourself lucky.A movie like this rarely comes along."

groudoka,"Sep 25, 2020",10/10,"This film would already be fantastic solely for being what I would consider the most well-written film of all time, or at least one of them. The fact that everything else about it is expertly handled not only helps this keep its status as one of the best films ever made, but one that's endlessly rewatchable."
bryanprzy,"Jan 27, 2016",9/10,"Sometimes a film leaves you with that warm, fuzzy feeling inside. It's a feeling of fulfillment and completion. A feeling that everything will work out and everyone is okay Oldboy is NOT one of those films.Drunken buffoon Dae-su (Choi) is mysteriously kidnapped and inexplicably held prisoner for fifteen years by men he never sees. He is left only to watch the same television and eat the same dumplings every day. When he is just as inexplicably released back into a world that is now completely alien to him, his only mission becomes finding the man who imprisoned him, by any means necessary.The twists and turns Dae-su's journey takes him down are jaw- droppingly outside the box, leaving the audience only to wonder whether Park is a thematic genius or completely insane nihilist. Based on an equally messed up graphic novel by Nobuaki Minegishi, Oldboy has become one of the best thrillers of all time, capped by one of the best blindsides that has ever been thrown at unsuspecting viewers.Spike Lee attempted an American remake in 2013 starring Josh Brolin, which isn't entirely terrible in and of itself, but it's hard to match the intensity put forward by Park. If you haven't seen this film, don't ruin it by reading into it too much. Just turn the lights down, turn the flick on and begin to feel incredibly uncomfortable by the fact that at any moment someone out there could be plotting to absolutely destroy your life for no reason."
souripal,"Oct 15, 2022",10/10,"The movie Old Boy was doing a bit of the rounds on many good movie lists and having a weak spot for Korean movies, I thought of striking it off my to watch list.The movie started with a man being imprisoned for 15 years. It shapes him in an unimaginable way. The portion where he remains imprisoned is a bit slow, but when he gets released, the movie picks up pace and then its a whirlwind of emotions, actions and what not.It definitely has the distinctive ""weird"" charm of South Korean movies which sets it apart from other movies.After watching the movie..the thought that was evoked in me was...what the fish did I just watch? In a good way. Highly recommended."
avagantamos,"Sep 1, 2015",9/10,"This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. This a classic revenge film with a big dumb gray area in the middle. I would really rather avoid any form of spoilers, so know this film is dark as hell(its a bit much really) and masterfully shot. The hallway scene, is an amazing shot that has since been replicated by a number of other films, even the recent Netflix, ""Daredevil,' show features something very similar. This is the kind of movie you can watch 4 or 5 times and notice new things each time, even new character developments and motivations. The foreshadowing is done in such a way that it doesn't beat you over the head, but is clear if you know what you're looking for/watching it again. A fantastic film."

This is my favourite movie also. This movie's hero ""Choi min-sik"" Chanceless performance especially towards the climax intense,settled performance. This movie's overall background scoring is amazing,ultimate. And This Movie's Climax Twist , ""I don't want to Break the Twist.""but super Twist."
Jonny_Numb,"Nov 1, 2005",7/10,"I will admit right off that bat that I'm not a fan of the whole ""Asian Extreme"" phenomenon sweeping across North America right now; as far as horror goes, my heart is grounded in the Spaghetti Splatter of Fulci and Argento; as for revenge, Charles Bronson always ""makes the bloodlust grow fonder."" ""Oldboy"" takes a bit from both: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without any apparent purpose, and vainly attempts to break free of his shackles; once he does, he seeks out those who put him there, and embarks on a stylized--yet strangely 'civilized'--killing spree. For much of its running time, my reaction to ""Oldboy"" was a stupefied ""huh?"" It has a plot as excessively complicated as a '70s giallo, and often drifts quite far from reality (not really griping, as it provides the film with a disorienting, surreal sheen), but is simply mesmerizing. From the standpoint of visuals and camera work alone, ""Oldboy"" is as beautiful to look at as Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" However, like Argento, the characters are less prone to expressing their feelings outside the requirements of the plot, and while there is a striking humanity underneath the bloodshed of ""Oldboy""--it simply isn't enough to elevate it above its own obsession with surface quality. Too bad, seeing as how the potential for greatness is certainly present.6.5/10"
hj1976,"Jan 25, 2006",1/10,"Don't be fooled by the high rating. You will be disappointed. Overall this is a very sick movie. In my opinion, this is more like a Japanese movie than a Korean movie. Some violence and sickness are totally unnecessary. I know that they tried to tell a thriller or suspension-like plot to attract audience. But why use such a sick and fake story? When you find out the truth at the end, you will feel very sick, I promise you. I don't know why this movie tried so hard to mimic Japanese movies. I watched several Korean TV series, most of them were pretty good. Nothing like this movie. I'm so disappointed. Why did this movie get so high rating?"
bmiah89,"Jul 19, 2012",10/10,"Oldboy (Oldeuboi) is the second installment of the 'Vengeance trilogy' directed by Chan-wook Park and is by far the best of the three.The first time I watched Oldboy it blew me away. Dark, slick, gritty and twisted, revenge has never been portrayed sweeter. I fell in love with the film instantly, I became gripped to my TV within the first five minutes. It kicks off right from the beginning and unlike some other films you don't have to wait half an hour to get interested. It seems quite straight forward a man (Oh Dae-su played by Choi Min-sik) is suddenly kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years without explanation and one day he is suddenly released. Now the protagonist is on the hunt for the man who's behind his imprisonment to get his revenge, however the story is more complex and gripping than that.Like me most people would probably assume that the film will go on and in the end the villain will be revealed however Oldboy is quite unique. After Oh Dae-su is released his captor Woo-Jin (Yoo Ji-tae) one day reveals himself. Oh Dae-su instant reaction is to kill this man however Woo-Jin tells him that if he kills him he won't ever find out his motives behind his imprisonment. Woo-Jin then tells Oh Dae-su to discover his motives within the next five days or else he will kill Mi- do (Kang-Hye Jeong) a young sushi chef who Oh Dae-su meets at the restaurant she works at after he got released, she becomes Oh Dae-su's love interest. If Oh Dae-su succeeds in finding out Woo-Jin's motive then Woo-Jin will kill himself. With the captor revealing himself begins the protagonist's desperate journey to find out why he was kept in a room for 15 years, which leads him to dig in his past. This makes the story so intense and entertaining.Oldboy is more than just revenge, blood and the typical overdose of violence it has a very intriguing plot portrayed very sleekly. For people that don't have a strong stomach it will disturb and disgust you(still watch it), some scenes will make your jaw drop, other scenes will make you speechless. There is nothing quite like Oldboy, it has all the correct ingredients. Chan-wook Park filmed every scene as if it's a piece of art; so stylish, bold and dark it seems as if we was to watch and feel the emotions of Oh Dae-su throughout the film. There's some amazing soundtrack and even better dialogue, everything just fits perfectly.Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Oh Dae-su is one of the best performances I have ever seen. It's gripping and mesmerising, it sticks with you no matter however many times you watch it, such a powerful and striking performance. I've never seen anyone get in to the role and portray anger in such a breath taking way as well as Choi Min-sik. Yoo Ji-tae and Kang-Hye Jeong also gave outstanding performances.For the people who haven't watched Oldboy I encourage you to watch it ASAP, it's a must see. I guarantee that you will not leave your seats, it's that entertaining. This film takes cinema to a whole new level, it breaks every barrier in ever aspect whether it's direction, acting, cinematography or background score. Oldboy has changed my outlook of cinema and after watching it everything else seemed mainstreamed to me; that's how much of an impact Oldboy has on me. I've lost count of the amount of times I've watched Oldboy, even though I know what will happen next, I was still gripped and entertained. Oldboy is in my top 5 all time favorite movies and I don't think any movie will be able to take it's place.Source of link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/"
mankaras,"Oct 14, 2015",10/10,"First of all, I want to clarify that I'd personally give Oldboy a score of 9.2 or so but given the nature of IMDb's rating system if you like a movie you gotta give it a 10 Where to begin? From the amazing score by Jo Yeong-wook to the compelling and skillful acting of Choi Min-sik, Oldboy is, all the way through, a masterpiece. Few movies manage to be so gripping and at the same time so emotional. Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, a middle-aged drunkard who, after one of his many late-night drunken endeavors, mysteriously disappears off the face of the earth, leaving his wife and daughter. Turns out Oh Daeu-su is actually imprisoned in what seems to be a hotel room and he has to spend the next 15 years of his life there with no other human connection. After he is finally released, Oh Dae-su, now a shell of his former self, embarks on a quest to find the man responsible for his mysterious imprisonment and his reasons behind it.Oldboy is a great journey through human psyche and you will find yourself thinking about it way after you've watched it. A must-watch for anyone who enjoys good cinema."
NicolasTheWolf,"Aug 3, 2021",10/10,"South Korean films are something special. And Oldboy is one of the best of the best. From the brilliant camera work and the extraordinary performances to the excellent carried out plot and shoking ending. I just love every single facette in this film. This results in a perfect film, a masterpiece."
sweekley-94234,"Apr 3, 2020",N/A,"What an amazing ending, mind blowing, brilliant storytelling, this movie had it all!!!"
Mad-Scientist-Matt,"Jul 27, 2007",6/10,"This is a case of a movie where the director has lavished too much attention, too impressive cinematography, on a story that can't support it. Chan-Wook Park starts with an almost Hitchcock-like tale of a man abducted and held against his will by an enemy he could not see. It is rather moving to see his anger, confusion, and frustration come to the surface. Sometimes the intensity is broken by dark humor, the sort of comic ""relief"" that also serves to ratchet up the tension. And the sense of composition and style is first rate. It seems like it's sometimes a cross between Hitchcock and the Wachowski Brothers.But they you start to see loose threads appear, and instead of tying them up, the climax just makes everything unravel. We know that the hero, Oh Dae-Su, has been the victim of some elaborate plot for revenge or sadism. But then we find out just how elaborate it is, how many things the villain would have had to have under his thumb to make them not be coincidences, how many times Oh Dae-Su had to make the wrong choice, and just as importantly, how many times he had to escape getting killed by dozens of thugs at the wrong moment. At this point, the movie stops being an assault on our sensibilities, and turns into an assault on the willing suspension of disbelief. There's a fine line between shock and schlock, the sort of violence that produces horror and the sort of violence that is so unbelievable it can only produce numbness or laughter. I can appreciate both, but Oldboy crosses the line into schlock at the end - and seemingly doesn't realize it. ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you?"" Maybe not, in this case...When Hitchcock went for shocking, he could leave you thinking that the world is twisted and sick. Chan-Wook Park only succeeds in leaving you thinking his own imagination is twisted and sick. Not really the same sort of shock."
ottaky,"Feb 26, 2005",7/10,"I wasn't able to find the time to see Oldboy at the cinema despite the overwhelming praise it received on release, so I had to wait until today to see the DVD.Looking at the voting results here the split between the usual ""love it"" or ""hate it"" responses are even more marked than usual and I've been looking forward to the DVD release so that I could make up my own mind. I'm a little disappointed to admit that I neither love or hate Oldboy.Oldboy is not a bad film, but it didn't bowl me over as I'd been hoping - maybe the months of anticipation meant that my hopes were always going to be dashed.The main problem with this movie is that it's just not very well explained. OK, that can be expected in the beginning where we are all as confused as Dae-su Oh, but too much of Oldboy is played out without the audience having much of an idea about what they're seeing.The explanation, when it arrives after a brief period of simplistic detective work, is something of a disappointment and, frankly, seems fairly trivial compared to the effort expended on exacting revenge for it. Dae-su Oh had forgotten the incident himself, and I really couldn't blame him.Overall, definitely worth watching for the great atmosphere and some nice set pieces, but a little underwhelming in the final analysis."
Benjamin-M-Weilert,"May 17, 2021",10/10,"Some storylines are so timeless; they can't help to be made into something modern-thus becoming timeless in the process. Oldboy (2003) can easily draw comparisons to The Count of Monte Cristo in its structure but adds depth and layers to a wild ride that unfortunately could not be even closely matched in its American remake in 2013. As it stands, Oldboy is one of the pillars that shows how culturally significant South Korean cinema has been and how its predecessors like Parasite (2019) and Minari (2020) stood on its shoulders to achieve greatness.Oldboy is a lot like Memento (2000) in that it demands a second viewing, often right after reaching the end credits. Many of the plot's twists and turns readjust the viewer's understanding of previous events-to the point where you'll have to watch it again with this new knowledge fresh in your mind, thus opening up a whole new experience to the film. Revenge is piled upon revenge, but the motivation of these characters is always clear, even if it is uncomfortable at times. Oldboy certainly doesn't pull its punches when it comes to sex or violence, but don't let that distract you from the engaging story.In fact, I would hope that anyone who likes well-done action sequences will take the time to watch this movie. Without spoiling it, I can honestly say there is a moment with a hammer that is as hilarious as it is disturbing. And sure, it might be a bit over-the-top at times, but what action film doesn't land in this pitfall and still manage to entertain? Either way, by the end of the movie, both the characters and the audience are ultimately changed by what they just learned and saw, respectively.One of the best South Korean action films ever made, I give Oldboy 5.0 stars out of 5."

jameslinton-75252,"May 18, 2016",9/10,"Oldboy is a film that hit me like a sledge-hammer. It is a remarkable film about the dangers of how revenge can consume you. The characters are three-dimensional, authentic and entirely believable. Stylistically the film is absolutely gorgeous. There is so much detail in every single shot. There are enough twists and turns to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. It isn't a film for the faint- hearted, but I advise that you just buckle up and get ready for a wild ride. Sure there are a few plot-holes here and there, but as a whole, Oldboy is a charging bull of a film. It stops for no man. You just have to keep up.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/xGP14r"

Sourangel_agus,"Aug 28, 2025",9/10,"This film is intense and unforgettable, achieving exactly what it sets out to do: deeply unsettle and provoke the viewer. Its story is gripping, with a style and pacing that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The performances are powerful and the direction precise, creating a world that feels both raw and compelling. While it can be emotionally heavy and traumatic at times, that intensity is also what makes it so effective and memorable.

ozi_wozzy,"Aug 18, 2011",N/A,"I'll echo the majority of the viewers' sentiments, this film is brilliant.I really did not know what to expect when I first sat down to watch it, except that I'd hoped it would be a good thriller from a well respected Korean director.And that's how you should approach this film if you haven't watched it, expect nothing, because that's when you get the most out of it. I've read a couple of reviews regarding the ""incomprehensible"" plot and ""rambling storyline"" and it beggars belief how these people have come to this conclusion.In terms of plot and storyline, it's one of the most original and tightly controlled I've ever watched. From the start, when a man is put in a private jail without explanation for 15 years, you're drawn into the story. Then it just gets better.Acting by the two central characters, the antagonist and the protagonist - at times they easily swap places, such is the clever story line and the brilliant acting - is outstanding. The energy and the inner rage with which both go about the roles was just brilliant to watch.The music score was pretty much perfect for any film I've come across and the main melody is as memorable as any you're likely to come across in any medium.The twists are not over-egged, as they don't need to be, and the gut-wrenching, brutal yet emotionally charged penultimate scene will stay with you for a long time afterwards. This film is in my top 10 of all time. Just watch it with an open mind. It's a great, great film."
akshatmahajan,"Sep 5, 2023",7/10,"I decided to watch this movie after hearing so much positive about this movie but after watching the movie, I think that this movie is little bit overrated.The story was good with good thrill and suspense throughout the movie. The screenplay was little bit uneven, the direction was good and the performances were good. The main problem I faced with the movie was it's pacing. The pacing was uneven making movie dull at some points. Also, I think ghe movie is little bit overrated. Though, it is good but it doesn't have anything great or special in it.Overall, you can give this movie a try if you want to."
hareyT,"Aug 13, 2008",9/10,"This was a gem of a movie. Please watch it in it's native language with subtitles. The English dubbing was not great and was a real distraction. I had to watch this movie twice to catch all the nuances of the plot. I just watched it on Bluray and it looked terrific. The cinematography looked great and the music stood out. Sure, the plot is your basic revenge story. A man is imprisoned (where? not sure)for fifteen long years released and is finally released (stuffed in a suitcase!)with very little money as he sets out to solve the mystery and get revenge on his captors. Good stuff here and worth checking out! The performances were terrific too! There's a scene on a rooftop with a guy trying to commit suicide that has a funny (and sick) ending to the scene."
frankfob,"Sep 1, 2008",7/10,"Interesting premise (man is locked away for 15 years by a mysterious organization and isn't told what he's done or how long he's going to be there), beautiful photography, good acting and a director with real flair combine to make a very good movie that could have been great if it didn't go off into outer space at the end.The character Oh-Dae Su starts off as completely unsympathetic--a drunken, annoying, loud-mouthed, obnoxious jerk who's sitting in a police station after obviously having been arrested for drunk and disorderly. He's eventually released, but soon afterward finds himself locked in what at first appears to be a jail cell but turns out to be a fairly well-appointed room, complete with TV. However, he soon realizes that it's not any kind of government jail or prison; it's run by a mysterious private organization, and no one will tell him why he's there or for how long and, in fact, he never sees another human being in all the time he's there. What he does see is a news report on the TV that his wife has been killed, his daughter has been taken away and that he is the prime suspect in the murder, but he knows he didn't do it because he had been locked up in that room. It's not long before he begins to go crazy, trying to figure out why someone would go to the trouble of locking him up and framing him for his wife's murder. Eventually he escapes after having been locked in his ""cell"" for 15 years--or did he really ""escape""? The all-seeing, all-powerful organization seemingly knows not only his every move, but knows what he'll do before he does. He meets a beautiful young chef in a sushi restaurant and moves in with her--but is she what she seems to be? Things snowball from there, and the plot twists, turns and surprises will have you going. It's been mentioned by others that this is a ""nasty"" film, but it's really not. There are some brutal violent scenes, but the ""nastiness"" is much more of an atmospheric nature. Although beautifully shot and brightly lit, the tone of the film is dark and oppressive (a nice contrast) and parts of it will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.However, the last half-hour or so of the movie went completely awry. I won't say exactly what happens for the sake of not spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that it will most likely leave you shaking your head saying, ""What the hell is going on here?"" However, even taking into account the disappointing last part of the movie, the film itself is still worth a look. It has more pluses than minuses, the actress who plays Mi-Do is gorgeous (that always helps) and has several not particularly gratuitous sex scenes (that always helps even more) and it does give you a lot to think about. If it wasn't for the ending, I'd have given it a much better rating than I did. Check it out."
Rurik_Snorri,"Apr 3, 2006",2/10,"Try as I may I cannot for the life of me understand the slack given to the type of rubbish like this. Let me rephrase, it's more than slack, in some cases there has actually been critical acclaim. For what?! Please stop it with the references to Oedipus Rex, Beckett, Count of Monte Christo, Hitchcock or whatever. This is a C grade exploitation film, poorly cast, poorly directed, poorly shot, poorly edited, poorly everything. It is one small step better than another waste of film that came out a few years ago which I believe was called ""Audition"" I think by a guy named Miike Tadashi. (Too lazy to check now). The amount of attention that crap got blew me away. I remember when Japanese cinema used to be acclaimed for Ozu, Oshima, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ichikawa, Teshigahara and others. Those were real filmmakers. Miike is nobody.That's as far as Japan goes. Surely there must be some South Koreans who are doing better things than this Sickboy.The only reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the very initial premise IS indeed interesting but is handled so incompetently and sophomorically that you might as well be watching a snuff film. In fact, if the octopus counts, it is somewhat of a snuff film. Just as violent and just as juvenile as Tarantino but without his (for lack of a better word) ""talent"".Basically a completely vile and disgusting exercise that should be relegated to the cutout bin."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Apr 16, 2018",9/10,"Vengeance - whether it be cold, calculating and entirely unnecessary or passionate, angry and ultimately fruitless - is depicted as an all-encompassing, life-ruining reflection of one's own inner emotions in this disturbing South Korean revenge thriller that pulls no punches and is vehement in its core ideology that when seeking retribution, you must first dig two graves. No-one escapes unscathed in 'Oldboy (2003)' and the so-called 'crimes' for which penance is being sought are so petty that when they're revealed you realise that the villain's motivations were actually to simply avoid placing the guilt upon himself (the only reasonable party). When the film reaches its heart-breaking, tragic finale it will leave you as devastated as the protagonist, before it all ends on one of the most deceivingly dark notes of the last few years. Yet, besides the fantastically well thought-out plot that's told with some brilliantly intelligent writing, the feature also relies on it's stand-out powerhouse performances and unflinching violence that, while certainly not as graphic as its reputation would have you believe, serves the dark and uncompromising story well. Dark, unflinching stuff that isn't for the faint of heart. 8/10"
shivakumarc,"Apr 13, 2017",9/10,Though the film is based on the theme of revenge. This is the best thriller I have watched. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves to watch the Korean Movies.Though the making was little bit dull the script has got that much power to make up for its making. If you haven't watched this film yet you have missed a gem.
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Sep 17, 2024",9/10,"Korean cinema has been on fire for the last couple of decades, and Oldboy has earned its reputation as one of the best films to come from this boom.It's a case where one of the most popular is also one of the best, as this is excellently paced, intriguing, intense, and dark, with some excellent performances, memorable music, and a very famous one-take fight scene to boot.But you don't need me to tell you that. If you're reading this and haven't seen it yet (and you're not too squeamish!) then it's a must watch.Holds up on rewatches too- I think this was my third viewing, and my first one on bluray with proper subtitles (the subtitles on an old DVD I had were so bad I don't even remember them addressing the ""Evergreen Old Boys"", so I mean, I finally get why it's called Oldboy now lol)."
christineyoon,"Feb 26, 2018",9/10,"I decided to watch Oldboy to learn more about my Korean heritage, as it is one of Korea's most renowned films. From the beginning, I was captivated by the action and darkness of the Oldboy. I am in shock because Oldboy is currently one of two films that I have realized that everything in the film is done for a reason; there is a cause for every scene, no matter how seemingly unnecessary, that the director will show later in the movie. The other film is Deer Hunter.Despite being a film from 15 years ago, Oldboy is more intriguing than the comic book and action films of today, because of its unique fighting scenes and plot line. I was pleasantly surprised that the film totally unlike typical Korean dramas, totally shifting my perception of Korean cinema."
Karrrzer,"Nov 6, 2025",10/10,"I simply love this movie. Everything is so well thought out, and even though it deals with extremely dark themes, it still manages to be humorous.And I guessed the big plot twist very early on. For those who have already seen the movie: right when he meets the girl in the restaurant. But that didn't bother me at all, because I was desperate to know the villain's motivation, and it was incredibly satisfying to find out."
peter-verreyde,"Sep 29, 2022",10/10,"I wrote this review because I saw a lot of people giving low scores. Many of those gave ""the twisted"" plot as the main reason for their low scores. They state that they ""were in shock"" after the ""sick plot"" was revealed. Now, isn't that the purpose of good cinema ? Having an overwhelming experience as a viewer and being blown away by a crazy scenario ? Nobody asked you to agree with what happens in the movie, nor did the director ask you such a thing. So many of the reviewers that gave very low scores because they were shocked by this movie, actually compliment the director and all the other people that worked on this movie. Crazy masterpiece !"
bob the moo,"Nov 23, 2006",N/A,"Having been collected in a drunken state from the police station by his friend, Oh Dae-su vanishes from the street and awakes in a locked room. Months later he knows nothing more about why he is imprisoned and is brought food. A year later he has been framed for the murder of his wife but still is none the wiser why he has been imprisoned or by whom. Fifteen years pass by and Dae-su has spent most of them driven by rage an a desire to get free from his prison. A month from breaking though the wall he is gassed and dumped on a roof garden inside a suitcase.Being, in essence, a wuss, I took my time getting round to watching this film and braced myself when channel 4 trailed it with warnings for brutal violence, torture, sexual scenes and ""a scene where a man eats a live octopus""  suffice to say I was ready that this film wasn't going to be Disney. That said there is a feel of graphic novel about this (I think this is where the material has come from) and for all its brutality there is a dark sense of humour running across it. The plot is engaging mainly due to the level of mystery in it and I was held unto the end. The conclusion is drawn out for a bit too long but it is still quite clever and satisfyingly downbeat. Viewers should brace themselves for a certain amount of lack of logic across the plot  this comes with the heavily stylised territory and doesn't damage the arch of the film that much.It is of course violent; there is no disputing that, and I did have to look away from the screen on several occasions. The torture scenes and such are within a dark context though and I found it a lot less violent than some Hollywood films that draw pleasure from gore and death  here it is dark and unpleasant and rarely exciting. Park's direction is impressive and the film has a great fell to it with plenty of style and clever touches but not to the point where it dominates proceedings  the style is the polish, not the whole show. The cast work surprisingly well considering that the depth of the film and characters does rely heavily on the rather convoluted and unrealistic setup. Choi is a powerful heart to the film, starting as a flabby drunk, transforming with rage and hate to the point of looking totally different while also making other significant shifts. The film very much belongs to him but he is well supported throughout. With perhaps weaker characters to work with Kang is good as Mido while Yu turns in a compelling and sinister character without ever losing touch with what has been driving him all these years.Overall then an impressively dark and compelling film. The violent scenes (and one intense scene of animal cruelty) will put many off, as will the fact that the film doesn't happen in a real world but regardless it is stylish, engaging and compelling."
HollywoodFlicks,"Mar 18, 2023",6/10,"I had heard about this film for years from friends , film lovers & critics and all I ever heard was how great this film was so naturally I was really excited to see what it had to offer.I have watched a lot of films over the past few years and I could almost tell from the trailer that this film is more sensational than ""good"" (whatever that means).It is in fact a sensationalized , supremely petty , intensely symbolic mess of a revenge flick.Is a film good because it's cruel & shocking ? Does that empty feeling you get after watching such a mess count as an artful impact ?You'll either love it or hate it. I in fact hate this film.You be the judge."
mujtabasaif786,"Jan 15, 2020",8/10,The story is very complicated and it is very interesting movie. The acting of the main role was superb.
tommyman,"Nov 10, 2005",7/10,"Before seeing Oldboy, I had heard a lot of good things about it. Many of my friends loved it and many respectable critics also praised the movie. The fact that it won prestigious awards from numerous festivals doesn't hurt either. However, this film seems to be the kind of ""hate it or love it"" type of film. Even in IMDb.com, many people believed this is one of the greatest films coming out of Korean while others said it sucks.For me, after seeing it, I feel that it is a pretty good movie, visually stunning with sharp script and dialogs. All the actors did good jobs on their parts. Choi Min-Sik gave us a good performance as Dae-Su and so did Yu Ji-tae as Woo-Jin. The chemistry between these two is so good that we can feel the intense between them. However, as smart as the script is, the film suffers from the over-dramatized ending, typical for Korean movies (IMHO only). It seems like after a superb first 90 minutes of the film or so, the director tried too hard to impress us with the ending. The last scene between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin is totally too intentional and over-dramatic; I was disgusted. For me, it is sad because the film, a little after its first half, was on its way to be the best movie from Korean in my list. The ending, however, ruined it all; it's like after eating half a bowl of delicious soup, you find out that there is a pubic hair in it.Anyway, it's not a bad movie, by all means. Kudos to Choi Min-Sik for his great performance in the first half of the film; he really put a lot of effort to it. Park Chan-Wook, the director, is, well, still Park Chan-Wook; great potential but never fully materialize his greatness. I'll look forward to his next film if he can really make it next time."
lareval,"Aug 10, 2021",10/10,"A tragic, dark and shocking thriller that touches the deepest feelings that are kept inside us all. There won't be another movie like this. A must!"
LeandroBahamonde,"Nov 15, 2016",10/10,"Old boy is an incredible movie of the genre Thriller-Drama-Police. It is the second film in a saga of three films (preceded by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and continued by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) of the great director: Chan - Wook Park. It is a combination of good performances, an excellent soundtrack, an impeccable photograph, etc, which results in a movie to remember, those that remain in our memory. I'ts A thriller that keeps you intrigued the whole movie. You can not stop seeing it. If you are looking for a movie that has revenge, fights, a lot of blood and death, this is what you were looking for. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen"
seryikryt,"Jul 30, 2024",10/10,"At first, the movie was just okay. It was good, but there was nothing too special about it. However, when the finale hit, everything changed. For the last 30 minutes of the movie, I was speechless. The only thing going through my mind was, ""OH MY GOD!"" The plot twist at the end is truly insane, and there's not just one. It's on the level of Fight Club's twists but even better. I appreciated that the movie didn't leave us hanging; it provided a proper, complete ending, leaving no loose ends or lingering questions.Overall, I would rate it 10 out of 10. I wouldn't recommend it to a general audience but rather to those who are ready to see a serious film."
jmjavijo,"Jun 18, 2021",10/10,"Oldboy is a bloodily violent, sadistic masterpiece that explores some of the darkest sides of human nature. Even though it's a revenge tale, the fundamental question it explores is the cost of truth, and how harmful it can be to those around us. I was hooked from beginning to end and I ended up shocked from the finale, which makes it one of my favorite films, hands down.P. S: I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a palatable story with a happy ending. It's shattering."
fos-28118,"Apr 24, 2016",10/10,"A friend recommended this and I wasn't sure it was my kind of thing, especially when I tend to lose track with subtitles, but I found this not to be a problem here. It is certainly a movie that you have to be alert to watch and keep up with what is going on. I'm not going to talk about the plot other than to say it is a roller coaster of emotions , twists and turns and keeps you interested throughout- it is unique. The direction makes you feel you are right there in what is happening, one of those movies where you really don't want to pause it or miss a single second. . Min-sik Choi, as the main character -Oh Dae-Su is incredibly good, his transformations throughout are worthy of any acting award going... I loved this film. I did some searches after watching it, to find out about Min-sik Choi and what else he had done..there is an article about some of the things that were not acting but really happened during this movie..check it out ..it's bizarre!"
FullBush,"May 20, 2015",9/10,"Oh yeah.. what a movie it was. The best climax I have witnessed in years. Though the story starts in a confusing way and one might find hard to relate the changing scenes but as the movie progresses all confusion goes out of the window. One can't afford to leave a single scene as each moment is like a piece of puzzle that you need to form a final picture. The story has been told from two points and the points meet at the end of the movie and one should be careful as it may cause some serious shock. Many would criticize the story writer for such disgusting ending. Oh, but that is not me. The plot is the boldest I have ever seen, and I loved it to the last minute, not all directors will be able to finish with that audacity. Pace is a little slow but the climax will pay it off with interest. I would recommend this to anyone hungry for jaw dropping thriller."
tedg,"Feb 17, 2006",N/A,"No movie stands alone. When we watch it, we bring all sorts of expectations to it, and a large part of that is the genre we expect. If we expect style, we are particularly acute in how we judge that factor, for instance.In fact, we've come to rely on how a film announces itself. What I find interesting about this one is that it deliberately subverts any expectations we might have along these lines.For example, most viewers will consider this a ""revenge"" movie, a very specific subgenre, and judge it on those merits. The problem is that the filmmaker goes out of his way early in the game to announce that these fellows are correct in their assumptions.He then pulls the rug out from under those simple viewers, just as he does the hero. That's the art here, and you'll have to judge just how important it is to you.I've become aware in the last few years how important the entry into a film is. The biggest, most shocking thing a filmmaker does is take us to another world. There are two big jumps he or she needs to make. The first jump is in the first few minutes, where the nature of the work is presented. If the movie is a strict genre film, this is easy because we have so many shorthand designators. Music is important.The second big step has to do with the first plot point. In this case, the episode tells us that the hero (our surrogate) sees only what is intended. His perception is bent, manipulated. His TeeVee is our movie.I registered this against films that weave stories about how stories are woven. The touchstone of course is ""Vertigo,"" where two forces or beings on screen struggle to create a ""movie"" in front of us, each one trying to define a false future that merges with the similar future of the movie we watch.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Open Your Eyes,"" even ""Tampopo"" are examples of this notion of storytelling, one that is intelligent and engaging. We have three entities as creators here. We have the guy we think is the master creator, Park, who we see borrows images as if he were in a drugged dream and can dream only in terms that he saw before he was locked up and gassed.We have the supposed master manipulator, who hypnotizes, drugs, confines, bribes, and uses force and technology to make things turn out precisely the way he wants. Precisely, with no misstep whatever. Nominally he is the one creating the reality we see, but his manipulation is more perfect than that even of Park, so we know he is suspect.And then we have the fellow that seems to be the puppet. But is he? He is the one that writes. Such comprehensive notebooks or diaries are common code in movies for something we enter. He is the one who dreams, for whom the images on TeeVee become a fantasy life replacing the ""real"" one.He is the one with the interesting hallucinations that start with the purely hallucinogenic notion of exiting from a truck onto a grassy rooftop. He is the one who eats life, and in fact traces his roots back to the manipulator by surveying restaurants.That business about snow and lost tongue and erased memory at the end. Shouldn't that tell us who imagined or created what we see? This idea originated in ""2001,"" where Kubrick played with the notion of who was narrating what we see: is it man, computer or deity? See this. Register it so that you can enjoy it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
matt-szy,"May 16, 2006",7/10,"Old boy is not a realistic film. Its characters are cut outs from some hyper thriller genre. Its plot twists are obvious devices to move the story along. And if these things mentioned are not important to you than it is likely you will be entertained by everything else; the camera trickery, the shocking torture scenes, and the comic book inspired story.Old boy is a film made in a Hollywood vein. It is more sensational than anything else. In order to move the characters along Park has placed devices (deus ex machina) with the use of planted cell phones, surprises in boxes, uncovering things the viewer nor the main character, Oh Dae-su, had known. Is this a bad device? No. Its a common device used in many films. Could the story work without these devices? No. And because of this Oldboy works in the thriller genre. Yet Oldboy doesn't surpass any kind of film conventions in this in this genre to receive special praise.The torture scenes are used more to shock than to tell anything new in the story. An example of a film where torture, very graphic torture, is not some cliché shock device but more so a comment on human relationships, pain, societal indifference, is Takashi Miike's film, Audition.Lets not be so hasty in disregarding this film as bad, because bad it is not. It has moments. The opening is definitely an attention grabber - a guy holding a poodle being held by his tie from a building rooftop by some dark faced figure, Oh Dae-su's pleading, after finding out the biggest secret (plot twist), where he performs a disturbing masochistic act, and of course the one long take of the fight scene where Dae-su beats up some forty people. All that is cool. And the film throughout was cool, maybe mostly cool for cool's sake, until the end.So if you're looking for entertainment with torture, blood, sex, fighting, topped with a comic like story of revenge, this film will definitely work for you. And if you are profoundly moved by the genius of this film, I'll be very suspicious. ALl in all, 7 out of 10."
anasamas,"May 4, 2006",4/10,"Such is the case here with ""Oldboy"" as 64% of IMDb-ers rated this 9 or 10! Comparatively, the professional film critics weigh in with a 7.2 overall average, a full 1.1 points below the overpraisers here. I WILL concede that ""Oldboy"" is several steps up from ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", Park's 2002 pointless gorefest that I also had the unfortunate displeasure of sitting through. At least, ""Oldboy"" had something that resembled a coherent plot, but this certainly isn't groundbreaking in any way. In the end, it felt like a two hour endurance test. There were no compelling performances, no memorable scenes, just a dark, forgettable film.IMDb voters: you really need to get out of the house more and screen some other films. Think a bit before you give every film you like a ""10"". You do a disservice to yourself as well as the rest of us who vote here and look to this site for trusted information. Granted, ""Oldboy"" is better than most of the garbage that Hollywood cranks out, but it isn't even close to being a great film.4/10"
vasco_cid,"Dec 29, 2016",9/10,"As controversial, violent (both physically and emotionally), relevant and unmissable as it has been pitched, Oldboy is one of those rare films that crawls under your skin while you're watching it and even more so once it's finished.Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive in a hotel bedroom-like prison until his release 15 years later. With absolutely no contact with the outside word, save for a TV set, he embarks on a quest for revenge and answers, while being regularly contacted by his captor teasing him with clues for his identity and the reason why he was held captive. Oldboy is a gut- punching tale of revenge, rage, frustration and anger riddled with mystery and an overabundance of twists and turns that despite borderline far-fetched, delivers an unmeasurable payoff."

saikatsamanta,"Apr 18, 2021",10/10,"A Violent & Degenerate Masterpiece which compelled me to not take my eyes off of the film for even a second. The Second film in Chan-Wook Park's Vengeance Trilogy, its the story of Oh Dae-Su who was kidnapped and kept in solitary confinement for 15 years, and after his release he goes on a bloody rampage to find out who captured him & why. What follows is a revenge saga which is so twisted & vile, & yet so humane & heartwrenching. The Director has his own visual style & so many amazing frames are present in the film with Great Soundtrack. There is a jaw dropping action scene in the middle which probably inspired Daredevil's Fight Scenes. Choi Min-Sik in the lead is utterly phenomenal. This Movie is Pure Perfection & I will watch everything that this director has ever done."
Eternality,"Jul 31, 2010",9/10,"Critically-lauded and an audience favorite, Oldboy is arguably Park Chan-wook's best film to date, and one of the key works of contemporary Korean cinema. Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes, Oldboy lets fly an intoxicating sense of atmosphere, an otherworldly, surrealistic feeling that sucks the viewer into the ghoulish noir world Park has conceived. We are introduced to the lead character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), at the onset whose life story forms the core of Oldboy.Park's objective treatment of Dae-su is clever. The latter appears to be relating his story to the audience but it seems he is just as confused as we are. Yet we are willing to listen to him, to empathize with his situation, and to follow him on his quest to dig for the truth. Now, Dae-su is quite a poor chap. He has been locked alone in a room by a captor for the last 15 years, and then out of a sudden he is released with only five days to unravel the mystery and find his captor.Oldboy starts out as a promising mystery-thriller, then turns into a love story, and then becomes a mob-vengeance flick. And when the pieces seem to have fit the puzzle, Park pulls the rug under us with a stunning revelation that builds the film up to its tragic conclusion. It is difficult to pigeonhole Oldboy into one or two specific genres because it breaks the conventions of every associated genre, resulting in a film best left to be admired and appreciated according to its own terms.Park is a very skilled filmmaker; he has created a signature visual style that is present in most of his works – a morbid coldness that gives viewers a sense of unease through odd color tones, unorthodox shots, and numbing violence that seem almost too nonchalant. While he could be accused of being overly indulgent in brutality in Thirst (2009), in Oldboy however, the violence makes complete sense.A few of them remain etched in my mind. One, the tooth torture scene in all of its g(l)ory. Two, the tongue-cutting scene, which is more painful than it impliedly suggests. And lastly, the controversial scene that shows Dae-su eating a huge octopus alive after he is released from captivity. Now, you may wonder why Park goes to such an extreme extent to shoot these ghastly scenes of suffering. The reason is simple – causal action brings about consequential reaction.As Park slowly reveals key plot points during the course of the film, it becomes clear that violence is not a means to an end itself (this is the nature of many ""torture porn"" films), but a meaningful part of a whole. Mi-do (Kang Hye-jeong), a young woman who works in a sushi bar, meets Dae-su and falls in love with him at an inopportune time at the crossroads of violence. When not seeking sexual solace in Mi-do, Dae-su would react (almost always violently) against his captives.In perhaps Oldboy's most brilliant sequence (a nostalgic throwback to those Street Fighter video games), Park choreographs a long take showing Dae-su fending off hordes of knife-wielding, rod-swinging street gangsters as he makes his way along a dirty, dimly-lit corridor from left to right. Such is his determination to stay alive that even with a knife plunged into his back, he continues to punch his way through.Misogynistic and cold-blooded, Oldboy is Park's vision of a world ravaged by tyranny, vengeance, misanthropy and masochism. Yet, he finds bizarre beauty in all of this ugliness. Based on a comic by Minegishi, Park's story is absorbing and consumes you whole. Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before. I could only offer my sympathies to the characters. Even then, I know that is not enough.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
thomvic,"Oct 28, 2011",10/10,"I watched this film without really knowing anything about it - I just read the IMDb quick summary on what it was about - and seeing it praised so highly and a colleague of mine saying to watch it and it is a must see - I buckled down on it on a Friday night.I was expecting this to be some sort of typical revenge film but with a deep meaning - why would it be rated so highly then? The good thing about the film is that it doesn't give you answers straight away and does a terrific job of keeping you engaged all the way through. You get to know the main character who has gone through years of torment for some unknown reasos as you experience his pain as Oh dae Su (Choi Min Sik) becomes a tormented man in his struggle for vengeance.All I can say is that this film takes you down some paths that you think at one point - 'oh no they really are falling for clichés' but then it goes down something darker and you are totally blown away by what the conclusion is. I am usually a sucker when it comes to finding out twists as I can barely spot them but let me say the twist in this one I did not suspect one bit and was shocked by what I saw.This is a unique film - the acting is perfect, the idea is clever and the emotions portrayed in the characters all exhibit human traits of being torn inside while still alive and just the whacky thing we can do to people to get our peace of mind if only temporarily.All I can say is that you must see this film and it is a film I will be recommending to everyone to see."
osakar,"Feb 1, 2012",N/A,"Oldboy is a great film. Not only did it put South Korea on the cinematic map, it did so while delivering a great, psychological horror story, told with a completely fresh flair and style.It is a violent film. The violence is over-the-top and shocking, with scenes of torture and bloodletting that are grotesque and wince-inducing. However, Oldboy has little in common with the stereotypical action or gore movie, in which the focus is on the violence itself rather than trivialities like plot, characters and themes. In such works, the events in the film function mostly as a tiresome haul that needs to be completed before the satisfying arrival at the blood-splattered money shot. Oldboy, on the other hand, smoothly weaves the violence into its story in a natural and unforced manner. Also, by refusing to shy away from the images of obscene violence, the film puts an uncomfortable magnifying glass over the ugly side of revenge. Showing the disturbing violence for what it is rather than glorifying it, it makes an impression that lasts far longer than that of Tarantino's shallow revenge fantasies.After his previous work, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, director Park Chan-Wook went a whole new direction. While that film was slow-paced to the point of being meditative, and had stylistic touches but maintained a cold realism, Oldboy is fast and stylish and bursting at the seams with cinematic ideas. Film-wise it follows an anything-goes principle, and it does so without ever feeling silly or excessive. The unexpected use of CGI, unexpected violence, unexpected turns of the story – everything is designed to catch the first-time viewer off-guard. Yet despite this, the film flows beautifully and makes perfect sense.The combination of music – everything from low-key electronic loops to intense Vivaldi pieces – and images is simply fantastic. Every shot is eye-catching, from the dark and crumbling slums of the city to the antagonist's sterile penthouse and the final scenes' snow-covered mountain tops. It is a film that is great both to look at and listen to. Even so, it avoids making Tarsem Singh's (director of The Cell and The Fall) mistake of letting the images be the entire film. Instead, Oldboy's story more than holds its own against the visuals and soundtrack. When the film's final revelation comes crashing down, it is as shocking to the audience as it is to the protagonist. This ""twist"" scene also has one of the movie's greatest, tensest build-ups; if only for this single moment, the movie is well worth watching.Oldboy is an example of a filmmaker having a good vision, the means to make it a reality, and the dedication and talent to pull it off. Direction, story and actors work together so well, it makes creating something like this look easy. If you can handle the violence, you will find an extremely well-written, creative, dramatic, humorous, original and entertaining film, one that takes you for a cinematic roller-coaster ride in its truest sense. A must-see."

(In Korean with English subtitles)
PSYCHOLOGICAL HORRORPart II of Chan-wook Park's ""vengeance"" trilogy where each of the three films are unrelated to one another and can be seen without watching the other- they are only related in terms of the theme of ""vengeance""! In this second installment, from the first 20 minutes centers on a drunken man who gets himself kidnapped by an unknown assailant before he is drugged and locked in an armored room, with the only communication he has with the outside world is a television set depriving him from society for 15 years. But once he finally gets out, he swears revenge on the people or persons responsible for this, except that it's very hard for him to adjust to society again. That his abnormality once going to his first sea food restaurant after 15 years in captivity, he asks for something alive, and the lady serving him brings him a live octopus in which he stuffs it into his mouth, starts gnawing on it and is still alive upon him falling asleep! Many twists and turns, revelations happen as he increasingly becomes more obsessed about the perpetrators or perpetrator involved with every new thing he finds out- the revelations becomes much more more sickening than the last! As mentioned, the real movie doesn't start until he's been let out, or has escape and goes on a blind splurge to find out what had really happened and why with little discourse from the police who're almost non- existent this time. I thought this film was interesting since I had seen films that 're similar to this, but it only gets interesting only until after at a certain point, since as the film progresses , I started to care even less and they're shocking almost predictable after seeing the first ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance""! This film reminds of trapped man in""Woman in the Dunes"" without any explanation other than he is trapped, leading this movie toward a shocking ""Takashi Miike"" type of psychological story and more influenced by shock master Miike than anything."
cookiechip_07,"May 27, 2011",10/10,"OldboyIs a brilliantly directed thriller by Chan-wook Park. Its tells the story of a guy who has been kidnapped and then after 15 years imprisoned in a room is let free, however he instantly seeks revenge on the guy who put him there.The story is excellent with a plot that shows depth and keeps you guessing right until the very last shot. The film starts strangely in a holding area at a police station and this is where we get to see the lead character 'Oh Dea-su'. Right from the off, you sense this person is an unstable character displaying very erratic behaviour. He talks a lot & changing from one emotion to the next in an instant, however we are lead to believe this is due to the fact he has been drinking when his friend comes to bail him out.Once out of the station he stops to make a phone call home when he is taken. The next time we see him, he is in a room looking unclean and dazed. 15 years passes by with nothing but a TV for company. This is one of the most important parts of the film, which the director perfectly puts across to the audience, you do feel the isolation he feels, the torment of 15yrs, wondering why he is there, when is he getting out, all these feelings / questions are asked by our lead.When Oh Dea-su is free he befriends a young lady who has taken such a liking to him she enters into his world, helping him find the man he want to seek revenge upon. Once he comes face to face with his enemy, all is not what it seems, as he tells our lead revenge cannot occur as you will always be left wondering why he imprisoned him so the reason must be uncovered and then the two will meet again.The film has so much on offer, some will point to the fact it might be too unrealistic yet you will not care for such a statement as the acting is great. Every actor portraying each role in a very realistic manner and thus you can really feel for each one individually on the same level. The director includes a wonderfully shot fight scene, where numerous men take on Oh Dea-Su in battle allowing for us to watch as if the side of the house has been cut open for viewing! When we follow our lead into his journey of discovery, there are disturbing parts of the film which are done tastefully and not over exposed.Although there is a memorable scene which is not so tasteful (or tasteful for our lead!) which will leave people squirming even the non-squeamish but had to be shown in this manner in order to be credible to the character. Flashbacks are used to show past events inside the mind of the characters which for some people is off putting but for me helps gather a sense of what really happened rather than relying on verbal two-ing and throwing. There is symbolism included in many shots and the director likes to revert back to earlier dialogue which wraps the story up delightfully.Overall Oldboy is world cinema at its highest quality. A colourful piece of cinematography from a notable director which I believe will no doubt see a Hollywood remake. If this does occur the only director I can see doing Oldboy justice is Quentin Tarantino. There are some people who will walk away from this film stating it was good but not amazing, however what I hope the majority will take away from Oldboy is a greater sense of appreciation for Eastern society film making."
RevCarndoch,"Jan 21, 2023",7/10,"Finally took a bit of time to watch this one and despite the rave reviews I can only say that I was disappointed. Although the premise was interesting, I found the storyline predictable and the production suffers from horrendous supporting actors throughout. The narrative, which attempts to deepen your understanding of the main character, felt very old and tired. Maybe I expect too much, but I felt that I'd heard some of these narrated character development lines in many other movies. I felt that the use of humor throughout, particularly during tense/emotional scenes made it hard for me believe in the characters' choices/actions. Many times I felt like this reduced the quality of what was trying to be communicated. All that said, expert cinematography and an engaging soundtrack music make the film worthwhile."

emilkim,"Jan 18, 2005",10/10,"Cruel and unusual...Please do not mistake the above phrase as a negative review of this film. It is anything but. The movie is cruel; unforgivably, unabashedly, brilliantly cruel. Mr. Park refuses to compromise his vision in the name of our innocence and he and this film should be commended for it. All too often films, especially of the Hollywood variety, forsake artistry for commercialism, the honesty of tragedy for the fuzziness of fairy tale endings, truth for dollars. The very ""unusual""ness of this film arises from its very cruelty. It is embarking on territory rarely treaded on by conventional American films.A man is imprisoned for 15 years. He gets out. He seeks revenge. He seeks the truth. The question is not whom but why. This is the basic premise of the film. It is not a complicated plot, and many such revenge films with similar plots exist, yet somehow this film is completely and utterly on its own plane. Maybe it is in the way Mr. park sets the mood - every frame is hauntingly beautiful, not just convenient to the story but as integral as the actors themselves, illuminating the human emotions that are such a part of this film. Maybe it is in the penultimate performances of its players, so truthful and lush that if Mr. Choi were to recreate his character on a bare stage, I would still be riveted. Some have had the audacity to accuse this fine actor of over-acting. To that I say if such is the case, then all the other acting performances that i have witnessed have been woefully under-acted. Maybe it is the wonderfully hypnotic score, or the vibrant colors or engaging dialog's(lines that are as memorable as they are fitting). Whatever it may be, I am a better film fan for having seen it.Some may accuse me of exaggeration or hyperbole. Watch it for yourself. Ask yourself after you have seen it if it has not affected you in some real way, whether good or bad.The mark of a great film can often be found in the lobby of the theater, or the neighboring diner, or (perhaps more fittingly) in internet forums, where the merits of the film can spark lively debates among those who have seen the film. It's images refuse to leave the recesses of your mind, and so you ponder, argue, proclaim ideas amongst those who have had the same experience. Such is the film Old Boy. Whether this movie was to your tastes or not, you cannot deny that it leaves its mark on you."
