gogoschka-1,"Dec 17, 2013",10/10,"Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
whoisfishmooney,"Mar 10, 2022",10/10,One of the most iconic movies of the 90s. So many unforgettable moments in cinema history. Quotable lines throughout also. A fun film on a bit of a negative subject.
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 9, 2011",10/10,"It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
mhasheider,"Nov 6, 2004",10/10,"If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit."
arthurclay,"Aug 29, 2004",N/A,"The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  ""The Godfather"" for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to ""score"" more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy ""The Gent"" and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Apr 11, 2005",10/10,"Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
Bevan - #4,"Oct 20, 2015",5/10,"Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.As much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.Yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.Speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say ""Eh, get an old looking car out there."" It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.Most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.5/10."
thomashamps,"Sep 13, 2000",9/10,"This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film."
darwinlovesprice,"Mar 8, 2022",10/10,This film gets you by the balls and you better strap yourself in for a thrill ride in mafia culture Italian style. 10 out of 10 rating from me full marks movie.
SmilingRon,"Sep 5, 2005",10/10,"Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy.As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a ""wiseguy"", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles.Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be surprised."
doolanfile,"Mar 19, 2022",10/10,Trouble with goodfellas is it sets the bar so high for mafia organised crime style movie. Outside of godfather and scarface this is the holy grail in its genre.
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 1, 2023",10/10,"The story of Henry Hill's life from youth to adulthood, from his own words.'Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.' The lines are as sharp as those suits.Martin Scorsese's incredible masterpiece still holds up as an out and out classic. Easily one of the best films to come out of the 90's, the direction, the visuals, the storyline are all fantastic, it's a film that never dates, it's as gritty, hard hitting and stylish as ever.The characters are incredibly rich, and there's such a variety of them. Some of the most awesome acting you'll see, the likes of De Niro, Liotta, Pesci and Sorvino,I can only imagine just how many films and TV series that this film inspired.One of the best films ever made, 10/10."
tfrizzell,"Jul 21, 2000",N/A,"""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5."
nicktusk,"Apr 26, 2020",10/10,Better than The Godfather in my opinion. A classic trademark film for a lifetime . Scorsese's best film by far .
rosscohen-08568,"Apr 30, 2023",10/10,"Hands down the best film ever made about the mafia. Maybe the best film ever made, period. From start to finish this one had me interested, and the fact that it's a true story made it that much better. Of course it's loaded with stars from Liotta, DeNiro, and Pesci to small roles by others including Samuel L. Jackson.The true story about a mafia associate who turns State, complete with murder, robberies, prison, and passion. Liotta carries this film but Pesci steals many a scene with his crazed antics. The only mafia films that come close to this are 'Casino' and 'Donnie Brasco'. What about 'The Godfather' you ask? I found them to be long, boring, and uninteresting. How could I say that? What's wrong with me? I'm just being honest, I think they're very overrated.The only problem with this film is nothing else will measure up to it. After watching this what else can you watch that comes close?"
stevenmillne,"Apr 21, 2022",10/10,Cracking story and film from a pretty cracking book. Can't fault the acting in this with little Joe taking the well earned plaudits with his performance that is Oscar worthy any day of the week.
Infofreak,"Mar 17, 2003",N/A,"'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!"
handprime,"May 27, 2022",10/10,This is my absolute favorite movie. Watched it so many times. I seen Ray Liotta died yesterday and watched it again out of respect. This movie is what other movies hope with no faith to be measured against.
bkoganbing,"Feb 15, 2007",9/10,"The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must."
mrsteakland,"Feb 15, 2023",10/10,"Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better. Rip Ray you simply outdone yourself in this role. Great adaptation from a briliant source material. You did us proud my old friend. Makes you wary to follow a smart dressed italian in a room ha ha ha. Joking aside each character protrays their characters beautifully. The jail scene has food to feel proud about so gear up for something extra than the average crime caper and strap yourself in for vintage classic cinema like they used to make it."
shanfloyd,"Mar 29, 2005",8/10,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that."
muamba_eats_toast,"Apr 25, 2020",8/10,Having never seen it before but heard so much about it I was expecting it to be one of the best films I've ever seen instead it was just very good in my eyes. Potentially it has lost some originality by so many other films copying features of it that it just didn't seem new anymore but whilst nothing was wrong with it and like I said it was very good with some fantastic performances it just didn't stand out against so many others of this genre for me.
nathanphillips-88119,"Mar 7, 2025",7/10,"I've heard great things about this film, but maybe my expectations were a little high.The acting was by far the best part. The story itself was just not that exciting and the ending felt rushed. The spotlight of this story seems to be off its mark most of the time.Liotta's character isn't that interesting. His wife in the movie missed the mark for me as well--I wanted to like this character, and the narrating from her perspective makes me feel like there will be some character development, but it never happens. Pesci's performance is what really pulled me in and the biggest mistake of the film was not giving De Niro more screen time. It's a bit overrated."
KubricksRube,"Feb 27, 2007",4/10,"Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the ""best movie ever!"" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.Art shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this ""the best shot ever."" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there."
eatoctapuss,"Apr 5, 2022",10/10,Great cast that act way above their already great legendary status. Film that has everything included in it and gets better on repeated viewing. A real oscar worthy film.
bob the moo,"Jan 30, 2002",N/A,"Starting with the 1950's, we follow Henry Hill from a teen who tries to realise his dream of `always wanting to be a gangster'.  He goes from running errands for Paulie Cicero to become a trusted man within his organisation.  Working with James Conway and Tommy De Vito, Henry navigates his violent lifestyle where death is never more than a few steps away.For my generation this was one of our first introductions to Scorsese doing a real tour-de-force of a film - I was too young to appreciate Raging Bull and his 70's work when it first came out and the eighties were a quiet period (except the brilliant king of comedy).  So here was a great introduction to a fanatastic director.  The plot is spread over such a long time (in terms of story years) that it's hard to get beneath the surface events, but this is a very minor problem given that it's such a great ride. The focus is on events and the culture rather than a deep story and as such Scorsese works with set pieces and events rather than too much characterisation.  However the story moves so effectively through the action - Scorsese uses long tracking shots, pumping soundtracks and scenes of building tension and sudden violence to create a masterful experience.The weakness with lack of depth is really put to the back of your mind by the action, the direction and the performances.  The story is well held together by Hill's narrative and the shallowness is easily over looked. Liotta is excellent as the aspiring gangster and is full of self seeking menace.  De Niro does what he does best in terms of the Irish gangster role but the standout is Pesci.  Pesci gives a strong role as the vicious Tommy and deserved his Oscar.  The rest of the cast are all excellent whether it's major roles (Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco) or minor characters (Frank Vincent, Sivero).The real star here is Scorsese - he uses the camera and the soundtrack to great effect and gets great performances from his cast.  A modern gangster feast."
Guitarboi615,"Apr 12, 2005",10/10,"One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. This and The Godfather are movies I must recommend if you like gangsters, wise guys, etc. This movie is actually based on a true story. The real Henry Hill, who is the main star of this movie, actually said it was at least 90% true. He than said it was probably 98% accurate. This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie. Really makes me want to be a wiseguy."
steiner-sam,"May 27, 2022",8/10,"It's a gangster biopic covering 25 years of gangster Henry Hill's life. It's set in Brooklyn, New York, from 1955 to 1980, when Hill testified against his associates and entered the witness protection program.The film begins when Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone/Ray Liotta) is 12 years old and fascinated by the thugs who occupy a cab office across the street. They appear to fear no one and do pretty much what they want. He begins to work for capo Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino). He later becomes friends with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci), both sociopaths.The movie follows various significant events over 25 years, including impulsive murder, robberies from shipments at JFK Airport, and taking over a restaurant to launder money. Henry marries Karen (Larraine Bracco) and has a mistress, Janice Rossi (Gina Mastrogiacomo). We see Henry's time in prison and his entrance into drug trafficking against the express demands of his boss, Paulie.The principal characters all represent real people, though the last names of Paulie, Jimmy, and Tommy have been changed. There are links to the significant events recounted in Pileggi's book, though much of the dialogue was improvised. The language in the film is exceptionally crude and objectifies women in much the same way as ""The Godfather"" does.""Goodfellas"" is a polished and well-crafted movie, but I don't think the characters had the depth of those in ""The Godfather."" Joe Pesci won an Academy Award for his sociopathic character. Liotta, De Niro and Sorvino were also excellent."
crendine,"Apr 1, 2015",7/10,"I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous ""Lufthansa heist"" is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings. But as an all-time classic, I don't think so."

gillmurphydogg,"Feb 10, 2023",9/10,"Honestly- if you put Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino - look what you end up with. This is an Italian mafia classic that pieces together a great script, music, cinematography and talent to make a great piece of film. Martin Scorsese delivers again.There's quite a bit of violence- it can be sudden and unexpected. Also, if you're a bit sensitive to swearing, this may not be the film for you (thanks Joe Pesci). But all in all, if you like Italian mafia films where there's no real winners and constant drama and tragedy, you surely won't be disappointed by this cinematic masterpiece."

It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- ""Wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!"
kevin_robbins,"Jul 6, 2021",10/10,"Goodfellas (1990) is definitely one of my top 3 all time favorite gangster movies and one I recently watched again from my personal collection. The storyline follows a group of friends who work together and quickly work their way up the organized crime ladder. As they grow it quickly becomes hard to identify who can trust who versus who is working for their own personal interest. This confusion can cause problems for business. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars Ray Liotta (Blow), Robert De Niro (Raging Bull), Joe Pesci (Lethal Weapon 2), Paul Sorvino (Nixon) and Lorraine Bracco (The Basketball Diaries). The depth by which this storyline is delivered is absolutely amazing. The details around every character, the nature of the business, the writing and dialogue lead to a rollercoaster of emotions as the film unfolds. You really get wrapped up and rooting interest in the characters. The acting is absolutely phenomenal by every character and the film locations are perfectly selected (I've actually visited a couple). The soundtrack is also very good. I loved everything about this movie and would strongly recommend watching it regularly. This is a 10/10."
dcousquer,"Jul 9, 2003",7/10,"Watching this good movie, you feel like watching the Sopranos,moving from one casual killing to another, with an italian family meal or two. Scorsese is so clever you're not bored any minute : situations are funny, suspense is there, both characters and actors are good. But you cannot go as far as liking the ""hero"" or feeling anything for him except a mild sympathy. so, all in all I give this movie a 7 mark but do not really understand its ranking, except if some have mistaken it for the godfather..."
Michael_Elliott,"Mar 7, 2008",N/A,"Goodfellas (1990)**** (out of 4)Martin Scorsese's masterpiece about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a man who grew up hoping to be in the mob and he got his but crime does not pay as the old saying goes. GOODFELLAS has been called one of the greatest mob movies ever made and it's been called the best film of the 90s as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It certainly goes on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made and each time I view the thing I can't help but be amazed at the brilliance on screen. It's really does seem as if this isn't a movie because the thing is so perfect in every way that it's almost hard to believe that it's real. Even though everything in this movie is great there's no doubt that every ounce of credit belongs to Scorsese.There have been wonderful crime pictures going all the way back to the silent days so the director was behind the eight ball but instead of just delivering a great movie he instead goes all out and really creates a film unlike anything we've ever seen before. The way he films the violence, shows the good times and the bad times. Everything is so flawless that you really do forget that you're watching a movie because it comes off like you're a fly on the wall witnessing all of this stuff first hand. There's the now legendary camera shot going through the restaurant, there's the terrific music score and of course the violence that really shakes you. One could argue that we've seen this type of story countless times but it's so fresh here that you can't help but feel as if you're seeing it for the first time.There are so many brilliant moments here but special credit has to go to the final twenty-minutes or so when Hill finally starts to crack due to all the drugs. The fast-paced nature of this sequence is among the most perfect filming you're ever going to see because by the time it's over you're going to think that you too are high on drugs. Another amazing thing that Scorsese does is get you into the events in these people's lives. The good times early on are so much fun that you can see why someone would select to be in the lifestyle. The camera doesn't shy away from capturing these moments including the high times in the nightclubs with the women and the money. However, Scorsese also nails the downside when everything starts to crumble and the violence is so shocking and brutal that you then realize that this lifestyle only ends one way and you're thankful that you're not involved in it.Another major plus are of course the performances. Liotta is perfect in the role of Hill and especially when you consider he must carry the film over the more famous actors. I thought Liotta perfectly nailed not only the young, energetic Hill but he really pulled off the drug-crazed maniac. DeNiro, as usual, is also terrific in his part as he brings so much fire and energy to the character and can cause you to fear him with just a look. Joe Pesci deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as there's no doubt that he delivers one of the finest villain roles in the history of film. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also impressive as are the rest of the supporting players even down to the bit parts.GOODFELLAS is without question one of the greatest films ever made and like all classics it's a movie that keeps getting better each passing year. Scorsese has made many great films in his career and this here is certainly among his best."
john_meyer,"Jun 2, 2013",2/10,"Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege.However, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations.The movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene.While the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw.Unlike ""The Godfather,"" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the ""inner workings"" of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being ""good fellas."" While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line:It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothingMacbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas."
drqshadow-reviews,"Nov 11, 2025",10/10,"Why are so many mafia movies so good? Is it the intrinsic drama of a hard-and-fast way of life? That potent mix of secret dealings and violent repercussions? The allure of big spending, exorbitant lifestyles and loud personalities? The mere wish fulfillment of doing something selfish, swinging your balls around and getting away with it? Whatever the reason, the organized crime subgenre has a disproportionate number of bangers. Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese's fast-paced take on the rise to riches and fall from grace of a real-life crook, slots in right alongside the greats. I might even say it's better than The Godfather, although it almost certainly wouldn't have been the same film without Coppola's influence.In some ways, it's almost a counter-point to that 1972 standard-bearer. Where The Godfather immerses itself in the machinations of running a criminal empire, the necessary maneuvers and backstabs behind the curtain, Goodfellas leans more into the superficial, gratifying image the families present to the public. It's most interested in exploring the seductive power of the mafia lifestyle, all the showy fringe benefits that would make a kid in 1950s New York gaze out his greasy bedroom window and proclaim ""I wanna be a gangster."" We're swept away by the romance of that dreamland, led on a swirling tour of VIP entrances and private tables and first-name relationships with celebrities; living the high life while also being taught the pecking order that makes it possible. If you want to spend big, we can definitely make that possible, but you've also got to earn big. And honor a rigid code of conduct.Scorsese essentially wraps his arm around the viewer's shoulder and takes us into that fold. We meet all the big players, a blur of names and faces, but settle down with an ambitious trio of go-getters. Jimmy (Robert De Niro, whose notoriety and connections make them viable), Tommy (Joe Pesci, a thin-skinned instigator whose impulsive nature pushes them forward) and Henry (Ray Liotta, the never-enough protagonist who balances the others' fire and ice) form a tight-knit bond, spend most every waking moment together and work the ladder for all it's worth. As time passes in big, colorful chunks, we stick to these guys and see how their game changes to match the world around it. The rewards increase, but so do the risks, and that's not necessarily such a great thing as success goes to their heads and their unsightly little tics blossom in the spotlight. These guys never met a pair of britches they didn't think they could fit.The director once said he shot Goodfellas to play like ""a two-and-a-half-hour trailer,"" and that's exactly how it's paced. Everything is a rich, quick peek through the window: a busy city childhood; a lavish stay in the clink; workplace disagreements; fence-swinging scores; unrecognized mutual tailspins. Like a life quickly lived, the plot races past in a string of highlights, but that's not to say it lacks for depth or substance. Scorsese delivers those, too, equally saturated and at a breakneck pace. An easy ten out of ten."
ctetrick-04340,"Oct 17, 2021",10/10,"This movie stood the test of time and every watch is enjoyable, a classic that doesn't seem to lose any of its charm no matter how many times you watch it. Simply perfection I don't know how any crime fan can find this as anything less than one of greatest mob films ever created."
stelioslyr,"Sep 7, 2022",9/10,"Goodfellas is awesome. I will not say it's Scorsese's best, I think The Departed is kinda better, but I really love that too. Henry Hill is an awesome character, even though he is a villain. I actually really like the ending of this film, although it is not even one of the best scenes in the film. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, even Samuel L. Jackson is in this masterpiece! Watch it, you'll have fun watching it 2 hours and 30 minutes and you'll never get bored. N E V E R. You could watch it 10 Million times and still having fun! The weird thing is that is a comedy. I mean it has some funny stuff you could never see, on other gangster movies like Scarface, The Godfather, The Irishman, or even American Gangster. It is not PERFECT, every movie has a bad thing or two, but this is just amazing."
wolfemmatiktok,"Sep 4, 2022",10/10,"A masterpiece in film history. Up there in the high end of many cinema fans top 10 movies of all time. I'd rather watch this on repeat than watch something like the remake of footloose, in fact include watching the original footloose also. Pesci in a showstealling performance as not just a mad psycho, a ruthless killer, cunning gangster but a charming character. You could be afraid of him as he isn't pure evil but driven by desire to be feared and respected in the criminal underworld not afraid to start slicing or shooting anyone that gets in his path. You wouldn't want to spend time in a holiday home with him when he is in a bad mood."
ajintvarghese-,"Mar 26, 2024",9/10,"Goodfellas is a movie directed by Martin Scorsese that depicts the life of Henry Hill in the mafia. The film very clearly shows the harsh world of crime and gives us a sense of compassion and relatability to the people who make mistakes and cannot forget their past.Scorsese makes everything look as real as if you were actually there. Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are also really great. This story is interesting because it depicts both the exciting and bad sides of being a criminal. The way the film is shot and the music makes it even more powerful. ""Goodfellas"" is a special work that will make you think about it even after it's over. It's not just a crime issue. It's about understanding the people out there. Many consider this to be one of the best gangster films and one of Scorsese's best films."
owenpont-70803,"Oct 15, 2022",10/10,"How do you not like Goodfellas. The entire film is just flawless film making at its finest. From the beginning scene that is just straight up brutal to a perfect ending. Goodfellas manages to bring you focus for the entire film throughout. All the actors did simply a flawless job. Of course the directing was fantastic. And the script throughout was cohesive and worked brilliantly. The film just does everything right. It is constantly intense and leaves you on the edge of your seat, even if the film is trying to be funny. Speaking of which, the comedy works perfectly with the film. Overall this is just simply a perfect peice of cinema."

rugbyhands,"Sep 4, 2022",10/10,This is a really great film that was amazing on release as it is now 30 years later. Beautifully shot movie with high production values and what a soundtrack through the times it's like a jukebox for all generations. Added to the Stellar acting its one of the greats. Would not be made as good today. A Perfect movie. You don't make them like this anymore that's for sure. Can't say anything more on how powerful and Brilliant it is. Well deserved of its Oscar and to be fair it deserved more. Easily better than casino which is also a good film but not near goodfellas. The late great ray liotta (rip) in his greatest performance.
calvino,"Dec 22, 1999",2/10,"Why should anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? Not one seemed to have any redeeming virtues at all, beyond a certain amount of initiative to make something of themselves, by any means fair or foul. That they all came to squalid ends was good, but watching it happen seemed like pointless voyeurism."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 13, 2023",9/10,"Goodfellas has a trio of fine actors in the lead role. That alone makes it one of the best gangster films ever produced. But it was the writing of Martin Scorcese, who unfairly is abundantly talented with both directing and writing skills. He makes these characters come to life with his superb dialog and story line.Robert DiNero and Joe Pesci lead the way here, as Ray Liotta is a bit softer compared to those two actors. Great supporting roles included a very convincing Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco. Pesci is a piece of work in this supporting role (he won the Oscar for it). His dialogue is priceless; as in, ""You think I'm funny?"", which now has become the most famous line in the film. Be sure to catch these bad boys for another viewing.PS. According to IMDB Pulp FIction and Fight Club are superior films to this one. LOL."
marygibbons,"Mar 18, 2022",9/10,"Highly engaging, you fall in love with all the characters and want to follow their journey, despite their vicious flaws and morality. Elements of humour, with horror, anticipation, intense with suspense, wondering when their time is up. It's go big or go to the morgue."
Francois_Thoolen,"Mar 13, 2021",10/10,"For me, this is the best gangster movie ever. Even more so than The Godfather series, because I think it has much more suspension and the voice-over storytelling technique just works perfect."
catscolapoo,"Mar 28, 2022",10/10,This is the crime movie for you. Its not slowly paced as something like the godfather or brutal like scarface no goodfellas is the perfect balance between both.
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Feb 12, 2006",10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****"
shanayneigh,"Jul 24, 2004",10/10,"One of the best and funniest lines in an excellent movie.Goodfellas is, in my opinion, one of the best movies Scorsese's ever made. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this movie. Fantastic.But it's all in the story. If you don't have it on paper, it doesn't matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As Brian Cox says in Adaptation: ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.""But here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the excellent soundtrack.And the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don't we see people like Frank Cicero and Frank Vincent in more movies?Not to mention Ray Liotta. I don't get why he isn't hired more often. Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take ""Copland"" or ""Hannibal"" or ""Heartbreakers"" or ""Blow"" or why not ""Narc""? Well, as always, there are exceptions. I wouldn't see ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" or ""Escape from Absolom"" again, even if my life depended on it...Joe Pesci is... ...well, he's Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny like a clown, and he DOES amuse me!Robert De Niro's perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who just explodes with fits of rage.As I said, one of Scorsese's best. He's one of my all-time favourite directors, but I just wish he'd stop making cr*p like Gangs of New York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe this fall, and I'll be waiting first in line to replace my old version.I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a compelling story as well as great characters. Although I have to leave a little caveat, It IS violent."

Love all the characters and Liotta stands out (RIP) - my absolute favorite scene is when he's joking around with Pesci and tells him he's a funny guy; I read that that scene was improvised. Will miss you Ray Liotta - not your time to leave us."
levelbigfan,"Apr 7, 2022",10/10,This was the biggest and best scorsese movie of his long and great career.everything is perfect about this film absolute proper banger.love it so much.
semereanrares,"Mar 4, 2022",10/10,"I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named ""Spider"" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with ""normal"" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch."
fayruzi,"Sep 7, 1998",10/10,"This film is a instant classic. It documents the life of Henry Hill and how he got into being part of the Mob. The amazing thing is that it's no fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny bits. Pileggi worked with Scorsese on another great Mob film, Casino."
kpt4001,"Jun 23, 2007",10/10,"By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. ""The actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,"" these critics might say. I argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. ""Goodfellas"" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could we really understand Henry Hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression?""Goodfellas"" is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero's crew of Brooklyn wise guys. It's also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long.""Goodfellas"" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o.Back to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind in v/o because as ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members.The one thing I haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in ""Raging Bull"" as was De Niro*. That's saying something about ""Raging Bull"" because Pesci won an Oscar for this film.) Everyone else here was great too.Overall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It's my favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story?*Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did research on the CIA and the florist industry for ""Meet the Fockers""."
Flagrant-Baronessa,"Sep 30, 2006",8/10,"Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life  from his friends, his wife, his job to his values  he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: ""I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like.""To convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is Scorsese's style. It invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where they are pampered by Henry's connections. It's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in Henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco)  the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow.This flow is the film's fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters  the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his colourful performance. It's all compelling at first BUT as is the usual mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. It is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus.I cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is Scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else.As for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with Lorraine Bracco's performance as Henry's Jewish wife  whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin Scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films.8 out of 10"
itsagotakeemdown,"Apr 2, 2022",10/10,Classic tale of young child becoming a product of a dangerous environment where criminals are someone to look up to. Great seeing a criminal work his way up the ladder.
Josh_The_Third,"Mar 25, 2015",6/10,"This movie is considered a classic and yes it is certainly of a classic quality. It has the rhythm and realism missing in many modern movies. It has actors that fit their roles perfectly. But what is it's point? I mean, technically you have all the ingredients right here, but nothing exciting ever happens. Is there a great drama here? Or great action? Great dialogues? Something to think about later?Seems like the movie's sole power comes from it being a biography of Henry and the Mafia. like their way of life by itself is supposed to charm with it's glamor and money. Perhaps it really did in the past decades? These are people who steal money, and murder each other mostly over small arguments. They have no grand visions, grand confrontations or dilemmas. Even the big heist is never shown.The characters are grotesque and very simple-minded so it's very hard to connect with them. They reach no pathos, nor develop. If this story is real, it paints a very miserable reality that is hardly glamorous or amazing."
michael_the_nermal,"Jun 13, 2006",4/10,"I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like ""Robocop"" and ""Sin City,"" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is.PS: Listen for the phrase ""you're busting my balls."" Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series ""South Park,"" where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times."
emperor_bender,"Feb 18, 2008",10/10,"This movie was an instant classic to me. From the second I pressed Play, I knew it was going to be great. And it was. A lot of people bash this movie for being a knockoff of ""The Godfather"", but it is in no way a knockoff. This movie is based off a true story first off. Also, there's no ""mafia"" or ""families"" really to speak of. And a majority of the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, he explains everything so well and makes ""the life"" look great. Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the supporting/side characters were great as well. I give this a 10/10, which I don't do very often but this movie deserves it."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jan 12, 2007",9/10,"Sad to say, almost everyone I know - at least, the males - who has seen this movie likes it very much. I enjoy it, too. I say ""sad"" because it's a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.This is a rough film, to say the least. It's not just the language; there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci's ""Tommy DeVito"" seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who doesn't? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the music; it's a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters.With all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord's name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a little too rough-edged at times. I've watched thousands of crime movies, and this gets to be a little much here and there but if none of the above offends you, you're in for a treat with an intense crime story that is very watchable."
OblanskHiggs,"Feb 4, 2020",10/10,"I just watched this film yesterday, and I absolutely fell in love with it! It is my 4th Favorite movie of all time right now! I love the action, the violence is perfectly balanced and just phenomenal! The cast is one of the best I've ever seen! I recommend this film to any movie fan that loves violence, action, and crime."
auuwws,"Oct 18, 2020",9/10,"Goodfellas was a factor in the inauguration of Martin Scorsese, one of the most important gangster film directors, and served as the starting points for promising actor Ray Liotta at the time in starring roles and a direct reason for awarding Joe Pesci the only Oscar in his career for his brilliant embodiment of the sadistic and crazy gangster Tommy De Vito"
jintrieri,"Jan 19, 2008",10/10,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of Scorsese's all time best."
luisk1989,"Jul 5, 2012",10/10,"Goodfellas by director Martin Scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time.What it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end.This is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good.The movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it.Then there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole.In the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well. There are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does."
tml_pohlak_13,"Jun 30, 2009",10/10,"To be frank, ""Goodfellas"" is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that ""Goodfellas"" far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved ""The Godfather"" has to offer.In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of ""The Godfather"" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of ""Goodfellas"" are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"". At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there.Another thing that is better about ""Goodfellas"" is its length, 146 minutes compared to ""The Godfather""'s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. ""The Godfather"", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about ""Goodfellas"". Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of ""Goodfellas"" are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here.Martin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing ""Goodfellas"". One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) ""Vertigo effect"" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming cliché, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies ""Goodfellas"" is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. ""Goodfellas"" is just about flawless.Overall Rating: 10/10"
tony-farah,"Jan 21, 2016",6/10,"I am really sorry but this iconic movie is unbelievably flat. I know this movie means a lot to many people. I was pretty disappointed when I saw it. I forced myself to see this movie in 4 stages just because It had a rating of 8.7. I couldn't sit and see it all at once. I know it is based on a true story, but it would have been much more exciting if the narrator dies at the end to break the monotony of the story line. Everything about the script was predictable. I raise my hat to Joe Pesci's performance and the exceptional skills of Martin Scorsese ...Other than that, I can't find a reason to give a rating higher than 6. May be it is a just me seeing this movie in 2016 i.e. 16 years after its release..."
anonymous-60980,"Apr 23, 2025",N/A,"I initially watched Goodfellas because of Joe Pesci's iconic role in Home Alone, and I was completely blown away by how different and intense this film is. At first, I joked about how this wasn't the ""Home Alone guy,"" especially with all the profanity, violence, and gritty realism-it was a huge departure from what I expected. On some level, the sheer amount of profanity even had a sort of darkly funny edge, which added a surprising layer to the story and kept me engaged in an unusual way.The performances in this film are absolutely phenomenal. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta bring incredible depth and nuance to their characters, and their chemistry is electric. Pesci, in particular, delivers an unforgettable performance as Tommy DeVito-simultaneously terrifying, charismatic, and mesmerizing. The way Scorsese directs the story, blending dark humor with intense drama, keeps you completely hooked from start to finish.What makes Goodfellas truly remarkable is how it balances raw realism with compelling storytelling. Even though it's based on true events, it feels like a masterclass in filmmaking. I've watched this movie multiple times, and each viewing is a blast-the energy, tension, performances, and even the mix of dark humor with intense moments never get old.Overall, Goodfellas is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates intense, well-crafted cinema. It's a near-perfect blend of acting, direction, storytelling, and a unique sense of humor hidden in the chaos-a film that stays with you long after the credits roll.The film's intense language and humor had me hooked, and I loved the way the story unfolded. Pesci's performance, in particular, was unforgettable - his portrayal of Tommy DeVito was both captivating and mesmerizing. Overall, Goodfellas is a masterclass in filmmaking, with outstanding performances, direction, and storytelling. If you're a fan of intense cinema, this is a must-watch. A great film that showcases the talents of its incredible cast."
mfmoore-1,"Oct 14, 2007",1/10,"Maybe I was so disappointed in this movie because I'd already seen the Godfathers and the Sopranos, but this movie couldn't have disappointed me more.I don't even know where to begin. The plot was dull and predictable. I realize it is based on a true story, but it was still boring.For the caliber of actors in it, I wasn't moved by any of the performances.The pace was choppy. The final half hour felt like an entirely different film.Very disappointing mob saga and one of the most overrated film of all time."
olivergtoney,"Jul 25, 2022",10/10,Best film ever made. Been my favourite for a while. Rip Ray. The scene with spider will always be my favourite and I love how irritable joe pesci is in this.

alo_pilot,"May 27, 2022",9/10,"I'd say it's my favorite movie to date. His screenplay is perhaps based on very simple concepts, but he handles it in such a way that such a masterpiece emerges. The acting, the direction, the editing, the script, everything is perfect. I do not think that such a quality film will come again."
JakeRfilmfreak,"May 17, 2023",10/10,"Goodfellas is a timeless classic that will never get old, and is one of my all time favorite films. It's and awesome movie from start to finish, and one of, if not the best movie of Martin Scorsese's.Capturing the life of mobster Henry Hill on the big screen, I am sure wasn't an easy task. But Scorsese did it to perfection as he does with all his films.Made with one of the best casts you could ever put together, this film has become a legend among movies. I think that it would be hard to find one person in the world that could say they don't like this movie.Brutal at times, and funny at others, this is one of those classic films you will have to see over and over again."
janetdarkens,"May 30, 2022",10/10,Going back Ray Liotta really should have won the academy award for Goodfellas. And amazing enough Scorsese didn't either. His best film and not dated one bit. De Niro and Pesci are incredible. Loraine Bracco so lovely and multi dimensional.

brendan-63701,"Sep 8, 2023",10/10,"Goodfellas is funny, intense, thrilling, dramatic, nerve-wracking, and tragic. A true masterpiece of the gangster film genre, I can't believe it took me this long to watch it. It's beautifully shot, and thrives in its more subtle moments, slight inflections in character's conversation that reveal a lot. This also felt very real and more grounded than other gangster movies. Every supporting character is well-used and adds to the story, which is also a character study of some very deeply flawed individuals.The soundtrack and editing perfectly complement the story, every decision adds to the film. It' s easy to see why this is considered a classic great film, an extraordinary achievement by Scorsese. I just wish I watched it sooner."
Chrimle,"Dec 1, 2020",6/10,"Quite solid for a biography, but it certainly lacks the connection to the main character. So much so, there are some parts that is not told from the protagonist's perspective, but instead exposed by other characters. The same thing applies to narrating from someone else's perspective. Albeit typical for this type of movie, the narration is monotone, plain and explains trivial things that did not need narration - almost as an after-thought. As if what was shown on screen was not enough, and they wanted to make sure they had convinced the audience that the gangsters were rich and powerful...The protagonist is difficult to connect with, as some actions are not shown until after the fact, and the lack of expressed emotions, thoughts and motives, makes him difficult to find likeable. The acting overall is quite bad, especially at the times where acting were vital.Although some story was told here, it was not really compelling. A lot of names were thrown around, money-bundles were exchanged and bullets went flying, but overall it felt unnecessary. Sure, the fact that the characters were untouchable was already obvious without the reoccurring narrator, but that also ruins any potential suspense and thus, the entire movie is a breeze - regardless of what happens, the character is unmoved and it perfectly fits with the flat acting."
tr91,"Aug 12, 2013",N/A,"I have only just watched Goodfellas (yes, I know I'm 23 years late) and it is one of the best films I have seen. You just know a film is good when you've been watching over 2 hours and it seems like only half an hour.The plot is great and easy to follow. The cast is brilliant and all played their roles incredibly well. I personally thought Joe Pesci was the star of the show, he was just crazy and funny as well, a really likable character. Lorraine Bracco was also deserving of a mention. The action is extremely good and the set looks fantastic. Martin Scorsese really has done a brilliant job with this film. The soundtrack was also great and went perfectly with the film. I also liked how some characters narrated parts of the film, this really helped in parts.Overall one of the best films out there, it is one of those films that everyone just has to see at some point. Well deserving of its high place in the top 250 on IMDb and all the awards it has won.10/10 - A classic."
pranavshantu,"Jun 4, 2021",3/10,"I fail to understand why this movie is rated so high and what the hype is all about. The movie is way too long, slow and boring. The action sequences are mediocre. The dialogues lack a punch. There is no point to it at all. The only good thing about the movie is the way the music and the cinematography come together beautifully. My honest opinion is that there are better movies than Goodfellas with a much lesser rating. I had so much expectation. It all came crashing down at the end. Anyone who has this on their list - You're better off without watching this movie."
liverimplant,"Dec 22, 2024",8/10,"I've been recommended this film more times than I can count, so much so that I thought it would be overacted when I finally laid eyes on it.Wrong.It was a really solid film all the way around and definitely didn't feel old or out of style. The narration helped keep the viewer locked in through the time jumps, which could have easily become confusing. The performances didn't blow me away but they all felt like they should be there. They were all a part of what made the world and atmosphere instantly enthralling.After watching Sopranos, it was cool to see the crossover cast members appear here and there. While the show covers around 6 years, GF covers almost 30 and it was so impressive to see it all feel satisfying in the end despite the jumping around. Making a 2.5 hour movie feel short is quite a feat and while it's not yet one of my favorite movies of all time, it's definitely my favorite Scorsese film.8/10."

WhatsUpManPodcast,"May 2, 2024",9/10,"The story follows Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, as he narrates his rise through the ranks of the Italian-American mob in New York City. Alongside his partners in crime, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), Henry experiences the allure and consequences of the gangster lifestyle.

However, it is Joe Pesci who steals the show with his electrifying portrayal of Tommy DeVito, a volatile and unpredictable figure. The chemistry among the cast is palpable, adding depth and authenticity to the relationships portrayed on screen.Goodfellas is an unflinching exploration of the consequences of a life steeped in crime. It delves into the moral ambiguity of the characters, presenting them as complex individuals with their own motivations and justifications. The screenplay, co-written by Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, is a masterclass in storytelling, seamlessly blending moments of intense violence with dark humor and poignant reflection.The film's technical aspects are top-notch.

wackoreviews,"Aug 14, 2023",9/10,"Goodfellas:A young man grows up in the mob and works very hard to advance himself through the ranks. He enjoys his life of money and luxury, but is oblivious to the horror that he causes. A drug addiction and a few mistakes ultimately unravel his climb to the top. Based on the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi.One word to describe this film is perfect. All the aspects you look for in a mobster film are just perfect in Goodfellas. From the voiceover in the beginning, to the songs, the acting (from a superb cast), the action, and the visuals; they're all just perfect. And Martin Scorsese can be given credit for a lot of those perfections due to his amazing direction of this movie.Throughout the movie, many minor events are encountered, which I personally don't like in movies, however this film is crafted in such a good way that the 2 hours and 25 minutes that are filled with entertainment and pure enjoyment pass by so quickly. The script of this movie is stunning as it gives all the necessary details for the audience to feel attached to some of the characters and feel pure hatred to some others and giving us many memorable quotes.Score:9/10."
alexrichmond-92492,"Apr 3, 2024",10/10,"97%GoodFellas proves why Scorsese yet again is one of the best directors in business. This film is another all time film added to his regime. I have only seen 5 of his films, but 4 of them I have given 5 stars. This shows how good of a director he is and I soon want to watch more and more from him.Starting with the acting, it was brilliant. We meet lots of different characters, but at the centre we have Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This trio was brilliant, and had undeniable chemistry. Pesci steals the show as this hotheaded gangster who is so threatening, funny and scary. The scene of him saying 'why am I funny' was genuine perfection from Pesci. Next, Liotta leads the film as Henry Hill. He is at first out of place, and really building into this society, but soon, he is the one calling the shots and put under pressure himself. We also have Robert De Niro, who is amazing as the mentor to Liotta, who guides him through the film. The whole of the ensemble is good beyond these three, and there may even be too many characters, but the film knows only to focus on the important ones.Scorsese is amazing and every element of what he does is purposeful. He uses a monologue throughout from Henry Hill and his wife to really guide us through the film. A monologue can be annoying, but when done in the way Scorsese does it, it works amazingly. He let the important moments play out, but the build up works even better with pauses, and just hearing how it is going. Beyond that, Scorsese is the gangster king. He really understands what makes these films works and really focuses on that. He makes every single scene engaging, and the film has the structure that was done even better by the Wolf of Wall Street, the rise and fall structure. There is tension like the Departed, and Scorsese just knows the film.The story is amazing. We of course have the rise and fall structure, and the scenes done in such an engaging way. The dialogue is amazing, particularly between the three main characters of the film. The film manages to communicate a lot, but it doesn't once get overwhelming. There is a lot to be said, for how well the film works in delivering everything it wants to do. The ending was also really satisfying.The technical elements really worked. We of course have the sound and score playing the background songs like in every Scorsese film, and that really brings a heartbeat to the film. We also have the amazing cinematography, which is great because of all the lighting, which demonstrates the evil in these characters. The editing was great, and the pacing just works. It isn't that fast paced, but that doesn't matter to me. It just works for me.Overall, an amazing film from Scorsese that shows his prowess. The cast is amazing, and the story is great. This is a mob classic, and instantly one of my favourite films.Related

acm7,"Mar 10, 2023",10/10,"GoodFellas, directed by Martin Scorsese in 1990, is a true masterpiece of American cinema. This film is not only a gripping crime drama but also a deeply insightful and richly textured portrayal of the American mob culture.The movie is based on the real-life story of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, a young man who aspired to become a member of the powerful New York mafia family. The film takes us on a journey through Henry's rise and eventual fall as a member of the mafia, showcasing his relationships with fellow gangsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).What makes GoodFellas truly exceptional is its flawless execution. From the casting to the cinematography, every element of the film is expertly crafted. The performances by the actors are stunning, particularly Pesci's explosive and terrifying portrayal of Tommy. Scorsese's direction is masterful, keeping the pace brisk and the tension high throughout the entire film. The use of voiceover narration, music, and editing are all spot-on, creating a richly immersive experience for the viewer.One of the greatest strengths of GoodFellas is its attention to detail. The film is meticulously researched and accurately depicts the world of organized crime in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. The script, written by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, is both informative and entertaining, weaving together complex characters and storylines in a way that is easy to follow and deeply engaging.Overall, GoodFellas is a true classic of American cinema. It is a film that stands the test of time and continues to captivate audiences today. If you have not seen this film, I highly recommend that you do so immediately. It is an absolute must-see for any movie lover and a testament to the power of great filmmaking."

Forget the goofs, this was real life in the late 50's, early 60's. I also had conversation with Henry Hill in a cocktail lounge in Manhattan (New York City) in the 80's.  This flick works!"
moonspinner55,"May 19, 2006",6/10,"Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****"
cfcpg,"Nov 28, 2005",1/10,"The worst thing that could happen when you are watching a movie is that you don't care, you couldn't care less. That is what happened when I saw it and mind you this is no lousy production or a B-movie, I mean the main actors are people like Deniro, Sorvino, Pesci... It doesn't work.There is nothing intriguing, there is nothing ironical. Ray Liotta starts jazzing right away taking himself oh! so seriously and I couldn't care less. All characters are unpleasant. This movie is completely off balance.The inside scenes are too dark. The light is terrible. And I am sick and tired of these Scorsese movies with the background music so loud! Hasn't anybody noticed that the voices of the actors are barely audible?"

rgpaeplrp,"May 12, 2025",8/10,"Goodfellas is one of those movies that grabs you by the collar and pulls you straight into the smoke-filled, blood-splattered heart of the mob - and somehow makes you like it there, at least for a bit. It's slick, fast, and loud in that way only Scorsese can pull off without it feeling forced. The story follows Henry Hill, a kid who grows up idolizing gangsters and becomes one. It's not just about crime - it's about power, loyalty, and how easy it is to lose yourself when the world hands you everything you thought you wanted. And yeah, there's violence, but it's not glorified. It's messy and sudden and awful, just like real consequences. Ray Liotta is magnetic - like, you want to trust him even though you shouldn't. Joe Pesci is pure chaos, terrifying and hilarious in the same breath. De Niro's cool and calculating, always watching. And the soundtrack? It feels like a mixtape made by a devil with great taste. By the end, the glamour peels away and what's left is just... emptiness. Addiction, betrayal, regret. It's not a happy story - but it is unforgettable. The kind of film that makes you sit in silence when the credits roll, wondering how many lines you crossed without even noticing. In short? It's not just a gangster movie. It's a gut-punch in a velvet glove."
FiftyTwo_52,"Dec 27, 2025",8/10,"Goodfellas isn't just a great movie - it's a cinematic experience that reveals new layers with every viewing.On my fourth rewatch, I'm still in awe of the lifetime-best performances from Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. Liotta's Henry Hill is the perfect guide through the Mafia's seductive glamour and brutal reality, while De Niro and Pesci bring chilling depth to their roles as Jimmy and Tommy. The contrast between the allure of power and the violence, betrayal, and moral decay is masterfully handled, making the film feel both thrilling and tragic.Scorsese's direction is pathbreaking, especially in how he balances the film's stylish energy (like the iconic Copacabana tracking shot) with its raw, unflinching brutality. Scenes like the Bamboo Lounge beating and Tommy's explosive outbursts still hold an edge decades later. The pacing, editing, and soundtrack are all flawless, immersing you in Henry's world until its inevitable, heartbreaking collapse.8.5/10: a near-perfect film that remains one of the greatest crime epics ever made."
brandonpartin,"Feb 10, 2024",9/10,"Considered one of the classic American films of recent times.Goodfellas is a crime drama unlike any other and plunges you deep into being a voyeur of a mafia enterprise.Watching this film there are many things that can be addressed and dissected but here are two major points that resonated with me the most while watching this film.The characters, they feel less like actors in a movie and more like people going about their daily lives, it seems more like you are peering into the lives of these characters rather than watching a performance because they seem so believable and realistic.(You also are always wondering who is going to get killed next at every turn)There is no remorse at all from the guys in this film.Another thing that resonated with me was the artistic quality of the film, the overall way the environments look such as large set pieces in restaurants seem unbelievably alive.You could go on and on talking about what stands out in this film but as you watch it, it just seems less like a film and more like being an actual voyeur of the lives of the mafia."
MJB784,"Apr 11, 2024",9/10,"Goodfellas is narrated very clearly from Henry Hill for affect. The filmmaking very artistically recreates all the years this movie takes place in from the locations to the costumes, cars, hairstyles, choice of music specific to the times and the television sets. Every camera technique is eye catching and the editing is smooth, too except for forced continuity errors of over the shoulder angles cut to close ups and medium shots in mid conversation. I also would've liked to know how Henry was out of jail in six years instead of ten or why he showed no emotion when he heard what happened to Tommy after Jimmy Conway's phone call. I'm also debating if it needed to open the way it did in the car. We knew it would be repeated later as it felt forced, but still well filmed. Maybe Scorsese should've opened with the characters standing at a parked car with the airplanes flying above."
eatmybibs,"Sep 4, 2022",10/10,"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" Martin Scorsese's woozy, dizzy adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's slice-of-Mafia-life book Wiseguy is many things: a social anthropology study, an epic look at the American Dream, a coked-up nightmare, a nostalgic look back at an age when made men were made men, a head-spinning display of virtuosic filmmaking, the blueprint for the modern organized-crime saga and a peerless look at a world where you might be slapped on the back or shot in the face. ""Mob guys love it, because it's the real thing,"" Pileggi told GQ. ""They say, 'It's like a home movie.'"" And as you watch Ray Liotta's Henry Hill go from up-and-coming crook to cosa nostra bigwig to Witness-Protection-Plan ""average nobody,"" you realize you're getting a funhouse-mirror reflection of an old-fashioned U. S. of A. Bootstrap success story, complete with bespoke Italian suits, bulging cashrolls and Bolivian-marching-powder meltdowns."

Bassamond,"Oct 26, 2022",10/10,"One of the movies that you MUST see. The story is well structured, the language is very fair and understandable comparing with movies at that times, although the movie is 30 years old but the quality of camera closes is likely better than movies recently released. I believe that there are movies written not only to be seen but also to be a reference for whoever is interested for making movies or thinking of starting an acting career, or even a story/scenario writers. It is also worth mentioning that the artistic standards that this movie is creating is hard to be achieved without such talented staff."
karenpageparty,"Sep 7, 2022",10/10,"These gangsters were always prepared, tuned up to every detail. What a movie! This directorial masterpiece by Scorsese stands out in all areas which includes visual,auditory and narrative excellence.the way in which this movie is narrated leaves the audience with a sense of fulfilment having watched 2 and a half hours of this narrative masterpiece. The cinematography along with the excellent choice of songs for the movie stands for Scorsese's cliche style of direction,the movie explains itself through the music and beautiful shots of excellence. Who doesn't get a chills through the spines when you get to see Scorsese'sbrilliant one takes and I certainly had goosebumps when the protagonist broke the 4th wall.at times the movie leaves the audience with a quest for high Adrenaline rushes while at times it leaves you cold and spineless.....Words can't describe how organised the screenplay has rolled out throughout this movie. The brilliant and often too realistic performances from lotta, de Niro and pesci along with the whole crew gives the audience a feel as if they were part of a mob too."
allyatherton,"Feb 22, 2016",8/10,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.""-- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro.Written by Nicholas Pileggi ( Novel) and Martin Scorsese.Directed by Martin Scorsese.First of all I'll say that this isn't normally the kind of movie I watch. In fact I think ( apart from Bugsy Malone which probably really doesn't count) this is the first Mobster movie I can remember watching, It's a proper guys movie. I'm a guy but I'm not that much of a geezer. This is probably to movies what Top Gear is to TV.It's quite long but it did keep my interest all the way. The acting performances are decent without there really being any stand out performances. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci ( is he really not related in any way to Joe Paquale?) were probably the pick of the bunch amongst this star studded cast of big nosed very Italian looking actors.Robert De Niro didn't really play a big part and for most of the movie it felt like he was just going through the motions and doing a pretty decent impression of himself, if that makes sense.The cinematography was good and there there lots of laughs, shocks, blood and twists along the way which I'd expect from a Scorsese film. The big problem from my point of view is that there isn't much of a plot. It's very artsy but there isn't much of a plot to keep me that interested. And I prefer a plot to grab hold of. That's probably because its a true story and they didn't want to make up too much stuff in case they offended the wrong people. I mean would you want to p*** off the mob?Overall this is a decent movie if you like this kind of thing. It's not really my kind of thing but it's still worthy of an 8 out of 10."
vittoriocosanostra,"Aug 28, 2020",10/10,"For a director, one of the most impossible tasks imaginable is trying to make such greatness for the big screen, and to do it well is even more difficult. However, director Martin Scorsese has succeeded in this near impossible task, as despite the obvious fact that no movie can be as great or complex as he imaginated novel, this 2 hour epic barely suffers from any such point.I do not believe that comparing the quality of a movie to that of its idea is a very relevant point, as every film stands alone as just that, a film. But if one tries to remain faithful to the source thinkedl, there is a chance some things get hushed up which might result in certain scenes not quite fitting in anymore. Of course, significant part of the stories of Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway & Tommy (Paulie was kind of like a 4th main character in the idea) for example were left out of the film, yet this is made up for quite smoothly by really only focussing on the development of Karen, Morrie & Frankie Carbone. Everything else might be barely developed, but it plays out in such a way as to develop our three main characters consistently. Thus, Scorsese has succeeded in narrowing down the plot to a 2 hour movie, and still maintains the essential continuity of character development in these three characters, and never does he really show that it is about the development of someone else.Much lauded, the technical aspects of GoodFellas are all superb. It is definitely one of the most visually astounding pictures ever made. It is also said to be one of the most expensive movies ever made, utilizing thousands of extra's and endless beautiful aristocratic art design. With the red army being called in to supply a lot of the roles of extra's, it is as if almost the entire American nation was involved into making this impossible titanic film. A lot of sequences are just about unparalleled, especially during the action ones. The complex shots of thousands of extra's in sequence in killing scenes, the reflective helicopter aerial shots of death and destruction in the mob, the many steadicam shots watching the movie, changing distances and overviews effortlessly without editing. The many scenes of big bosses society, the beautiful balls, costumes, cathedrals. There is also an incredible one-take shot of a ball sequence where the camera steadicams from the opening towards a certain door and back, ending perfectly symmetrical, that is just an epitome of the directorial smoothness this picture consists of. It is so exquisitely shot that nearly every frame is material for a beautiful painting, and it comes as no surprise that Fincher was highly influenced by these visuals for his masterpiece: Fight Club.The acting is also superb in this rendition of The GoodFellas, especially Lorraine Bracco as Karen. She perfectly embodies the vivaciousness, innocence, happiness, artlessness & naivety of Scorsese's character, as if she just walked out of the idea into the screen. De Niro, casting himself as Jimmy Conway, also has this merit, as he perfectly displays the clumsy, idealistic, kind-hearted & absent minded nature of the Jimmy in the thought. And to top it off, the strict and stoic demeanor of Joe Pesci as Tommy also perfectly embodies Scorsese's character spirit. Of course, accuracy to the idea in these terms is not required to create a superb movie, but when the movie is as faithful to the thougtl as this one, it would not make a lot of sense to have your characters utilize traits they should never have had. In any case, these characters feel just as alive as they are in Scorsese's novel.The dialogue, well adapted from the source material, is psychologically & philosophically superb, although of course a lot of those credits go to Marty, but the narrative implementation of psychological happenings in the minds of our three main characters is a brilliant addition to add as much scope as possible to a film that already has a scale that is nearly unequaled. A lot of people complain that in Scorsese's next film Casino (1995) there was much scale and little scope, but this is not the case for GoodFellas. As it is both substantial in terms of character, and gigantic in terms of scale. The score is also excellent, and often used effectively as a reflective measure near the end of battles, or beautifully during balls. It is varied, it is epic and it is beautiful at the same time.It would be a hard task to distinguish what aspect of GoodFellas isn't great, and due to its incredible complexity largely owed to a 2-hour runtime, there's very little movies that can possibly equal the pure raw incredible power of will that was needed to create such a giant production, not to mention the personal poignancy also evident in its main characters. Thus, despite the fact that this film is not widely known due to various reasons, there is little doubt as to its status of an all-time great among motion pictures."
norbi_nw,"Mar 18, 2008",10/10,"Most of the time when i see a good movie I come to IMDb, and read some user comments. I like to read the negative ones, to see how STUPID people are. Well today after i saw this movie (i'm 20 years old, but never saw this movie before - shame) i wanted to see what do other people say about it. This movie deserves 11/10 stars. I really REALLY don't know why didn't it got an Oscar, but it's pity. Now 1 IDIOT user wrote ""why do people rate movies like this so high?"" The only thing i can say is: Dude, life is not only pink and furry, you have to look at the other side of life, the dark side. In this movie you will find a superb story of how was life back then, when the mobs ruled all. Violence is this guys problem... Dude, take a look around, and see for yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back then, sad but true. And at the end of the movie Ray really broke my heart: he ordered spaghetti and sauce, and he got ketchup with cheap noodles - NOTHING is like it was back then.. EVERYTHING is falling apart, we eat junk food, have to ""wait in line"", quality of products drop, no good music... (just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E class.. cobra's simply wouldn't break down - Mercedes almost got bankrupted - new cars, in 5-8 years u have to change em) but lets get back to the movie. Another user wrote ""WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.."" well i don't know what to say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie, but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action, good story, betray, love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is, that it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 50-60's. real life, true friends. Watch this movie, and feel it. I just love the old mafia. So brutal, yet so catching. always together.. in good and bad.."
TheEmulator23,"Apr 1, 2008",10/10,"This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since ""Goodfellas"" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that ""Dances with Wolves"" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved ""Wolves"" ""Goodfellas"" has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles."
kgbellinger24,"Jul 28, 2007",N/A,"After seeing all the Godfathers, knock off mob movies on TV, the departed etc. I turned to Goodfellas. This movie had phenomenal acting and i loved how it connected to actual people rather than fictional ones. However, the direction and pacing is what detracted this movie's overall appeal. It was too slow in some parts and it seemed the movie had no sense of direction in some parts, which made me uninterested.Joe Pesci, got under my thick skin, which proves how well he lived this character. He wasn't acting. Some of his scenes I will never forget. Liotta also proved to me he is an actor of high caliber. It was also interesting to see De Niro in a supporting role than the lead.I think this movie is tad-bit overrated, especially for its direction. Scorcesse has yet to really impress me, though i enjoyed departed. Good portrayal of the mobs underbelly but it seemed like i ve seen this movie before. It was seemed like deja vu almost."
jromanbaker,"Feb 2, 2024",6/10,"I did not see ' Goodfellas ' back in the 1990's and a day after seeing the great ' The Departed ' I was to be honest bored by it. I felt I had seen it all before in other films, and its being based on a true story and having actors to play real people did not give me a bonus interest. Why ? For me I think it depends on the acting, and the pace of the film. ' Goodfellas ' has a similar opening as ' The Departed ' with a kid on the block being introduced to mob crime, and pursuing that way of life. Similar too that at the opening we witness a brutal killing, this time of a brutalised man in the boot of a car. Maybe I should have watched ' Goodfellas ' first, but I feel that I would have considered ' The Departed ' the better film. For a start I feel a film is as good as its actors and their energy, and other than the late Ray Liotta I was not charged up by the other performances. The off the cuff dialogue seemed tedious, and the four letter words seemed frankly lazy. I read that Scorsese let the cast use ' natural ' dialogue and edited the best, and I found most of it just covering empty time. But Liotta shines as the kid grown up, and it is from his perspective and that of his wife who are in the forefront and narrate the film. Robert de Niro was a disappointment, but at least he bothered to have ageing makeup. The film covers from the 1950's to a couple of decades later. Maybe trivial, but laziness in filming important detail can lead to disbelief, and Liotta remained as young as when he started. I could also have done with less songs of the times on the soundtrack. And unlike ' The Departed ' I did not find outstanding set pieces. I am willing to believe it is one of the greatest films but not for me. I longed for DiCaprio and Damon to explode on the screen and to be completely honest I was bored by most of the acting. One last dislikeable detail was the killing of a black man for no apparent reason that I could account for. A very ugly short scene committed while the killers made a cup of coffee. It left a sour taste in the mouth and maybe then I switched off interest in the characters."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 29, 2013",10/10,"Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) worked for Italian mobsters as a kid. He would climb the ladder as he becomes a big time gangster with his friends Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and James Conway (Robert De Niro). Director Martin Scorsese brings the Nicholas Pileggi book 'Wiseguy' alive.For an American gangster movie, there is none better than the great acting in this classic. There is no more iconic performance than Joe Pesci. ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" Robert De Niro is only the third most outrageous performer. Even the constant Ray Liotta narration worked perfectly, and I'm not usually a fan of narrations. Scorsese is a true master. The steady cam entry into Copacabana is first rate. (I know they made a big loop around the kitchen.) And this movie starts a bang, literally."
BA_Harrison,"Nov 11, 2016",9/10,"As far back as I can remember, I've never wanted to be a gangster. I'd crack under the pressure and would probably wind up getting whacked (I've not a drop of Sicilian blood in me either, so would never be a 'made' man). I'm far safer sat here at my Mac typing film reviews.Real life mobster Henry Hill (portrayed by Ray Liotta), on the other hand, had always wanted to be a 'wiseguy', and lived the dream to the full, making all the right connections and bags of cash in the process, at least until his greed got him into trouble with mob bosses and he was forced to turn state's evidence to save his skin.As directed by Martin Scorsese, this account of Hill's exploits is extremely gripping stuff, with great period detail, a superb soundtrack, and a standout cast (including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci) all putting in great performances, Pesci in particular giving it all as loose cannon Tommy DeVito, one of the scariest characters ever committed to film (his classic 'funny like a clown?' scene is unbearably tense). The film is also incredibly violent, showing the harsh reality of the 'business' in unflinching detail, opening as it means to go on with the brutal stabbing and shooting of some poor sap in the trunk of a car.Nope a life of crime is definitely not for me. Now what shall I review next?"
camwilcox,"Apr 29, 2020",10/10,"I love the way this film is shot, it looks like a moving Italian painting, and I think the cinematographer did that on purpose, my favourite shot is where Henry's wife was abused and he's walking up to the abuser, there's no dialogue just the sound of his shoes tapping the floor. There are no bad guys in this film the only bad guys are the main characters, and somehow you root for them, that's how you make a good bad guy, you can understand their intentions.And the acting? Oh my god. It feels like the cameraman's a ghost and he's just recording these people's daily life, they're all distinct and natural, even the background actors add to the realism of the world. There's narration throughout the whole film, films use this as a tool to dump exposition but this one uses it to explain the thoughts and feelings of the characters, it also shows how insanely twisted these gangsters are. Even though there isn't a main goal except for Harry wanting to be a gangster, this film manages to be entertaining through and through.It's another classic gangster flick. And goodfellas is an absolute 10/10"
Red-Barracuda,"Apr 22, 2011",10/10,"Goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. Martin Scorsese at his best is an incredibly dynamic director and Goodfellas is most certainly one of his greatest achievements. For a film that clocks in at two and a half hours it sure moves at a fast pace. This is a movie that never lags. There is no waste. It's a master-class in how to keep an audience glued to a screen.It documents the story of Henry Hill the real life gangster. Like the 30's gangster films it's a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is considerably more complex. I'm not sure how close the film is to actual events, but I do realize that some principal characters have had their names changed for some reason. Ultimately, the level of actual authenticity doesn't matter very much as this is a superlative film either way.Scorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. This film like many of his others is very raw. Language and violence are strong; the latter, very much so in the murder of the character Billy Batts. The brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. Yet it does still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. Acting is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances. Although special mention does have to go to Joe Pesci whose character Tommy is seriously unforgettable. Tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. Most film-makers would never have recognized that an actor as small as Pesci would be ideal for the role of this character. But Pesci's size and high-pitched voice only add to his menace somehow, it's as if these defects of his character make Tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more bitter and dangerous guy. Scorsese's trademark use of popular music is excellently incorporated into the film. The tunes by turns indicate the time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to proceedings. It's a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning.In a nutshell, Goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there. As a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. Recommended unreservedly."
dhauff78,"Jun 4, 2023",10/10,"From its infamous opening line, Goodfellas will either make you want to be a gangster or, more likely, appreciate and understand what they do. Appreciate in the sense that they get stuff done even when the inevitable killings happen.Martin Scorsese doesn't just make a great crime drama here. Instead, he weaves a tapestry of artistry that remains unparalleled and unmatched, to which I couldn't be more grateful for.Goodfellas is a perfect movie, yes, but it's also THE perfect movie. Flawless in the acting, editing, writing, narration, music, casting and everything else. You can't appreciate movies without it."

Ughhh ReALsTiC MoViE, It's awesome! So the best movie genre is... Documentary. They're not realistic, they're real.

dylanwhaley,"May 24, 2021",10/10,"Amazing soundtrack. Throughly great acting. Perfect script. Scorsese does his thing as always.Its a perfect look into the life of crime. Joe Pesci in particular is spectacular as Tommy, one of my favorite characters ever."
Habibi-Universe,"Sep 27, 2020",9/10,"Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' (1990) is an iconic gangster/mobster movie about the real-life story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), his life in the mob and his relationship with his mob partners Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in the Italian-American crime syndicate.It is genuinely a great feeling when you get the opportunity to review an all-time great film such as 'Goodfellas'!
This is the one pure gangster movie that everybody keeps talking about (I don't consider 'The Godfather' a ""pure"" gangster movie)!I am someone whose number one favorite director of all time is Martin Scorsese and I therefore love a lot of his movies! While 'Goodfellas' is not my favorite film of his, it is certainly Scorsese's most iconic and beloved piece! For heaven's sake, this film is one of the top 20 highest rated films! There are so many good reasons why the film deserves this great amount of praise!Let me now explain why this film is so great! First and foremost, the acting performances as well as the chemistry between all the actors are both completely on point!The protagonist in this film is Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill who also does the voice-over explaining the whole process of becoming and being a gangster. Liotta plays a bit of a socially awkward character who has some weird tendencies, yet he fits in well with his gangster group.Of course we also have to talk about Robert De Niro, the acting genius! De Niro is an absolute titan in the film industry. He paved the way for so many young actors who looked up to him thanks to his incredible performances over the many decades! De Niro's most iconic role might just be the one of James Conway in this movie! I don't know how De Niro does it, but he can make anything look cool. There is one iconic scene of him just smoking a cigarette for about 20-30 seconds. That scene alone is one of the greatest scenes in film history! De Niro has always had the incredible ability to stir up the whole scene and be an absolute scene-stealer! Many of these mob movies require actors that bring a lot of charisma with them. Robert De Niro is definitely one of those actors who can fool the audience, making them think that he might not be so bad after all due to his undeniable charm and charisma!When you talk about gangster movies, names like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci usually come up very frequently. Speaking of Joe Pesci, he arguably delivers a career best performance in this film!
Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a really funny, yet extremely scary gangster who, if you annoy him a little bit (""break his balls a bit""), might end up killing you on the spot. He is THAT crazy! Joe Pesci plays this gangster with such brilliance and precision! It seems effortless the way he just talks and acts. It's like he is a real-life gangster himself! That's how convincing Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito! I also find it pretty amazing that I picture an Italian gangster to be someone like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito. The way he talks, acts and the things he says.Moving on, let's talk about the genius mastermind that we can all thank for making this film, Martin Scorsese!
Scorsese wrote the screenplay for 'Goodfellas' alongside Nicholas Pileggi. Scorsese obviously also directed the film. Let me get down to the nitty-gritty. This motion picture has some outstanding cinematography! There is one scene when you can see characters walking inside a restaurant through the back and the camera always staying behind them as they move from one room into the next. The way it was shot blew me totally away!The film also has really fitting musical choices with lyrics that can partly tell the story without any voice-overs needed. Now THAT is not something you experience in a lot of movies out there.As if I haven't given the film enough praise already, I need to commend the editing department for doing such a fantastic job with the pacing of the film as well as the great transitions between the scenes!On top of that I definitely appreciate that this is not a predictable film. Furthermore it is a very rewatchable film because, despite being over 3 decades old, it still manages to stay so relevant, fresh, timeless and unique, all at the same time!Before I wrap up this review of mine, I most certainly need to compare this film with Scorsese's other mobster movies! In my opinion 'Goodfellas' is better than 'Mean Streets' (1973) and 'The Departed' (2006) while not being quite as great as 'The Irishman' (2019) and 'Casino' (1995) in my opinion!I only really have two minor criticisms. Firstly the film is more interesting to me when it was about the gangsters interacting with each other. The scenes that were about Henry Hill's family and that whole side story was definitely good, but it was just not on the same level.
Finally this movie wraps up a little too quickly for my taste. I thought the ending was a bit too abrupt. Like I said I only have ""minor"" criticisms!Overall, Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' is one of the best motion pictures ever made! This is an absolute must-see for anyone out there who, for some reason, hasn't seen it yet! 'Goodfellas' has been hugely influential in pop culture and it is still constantly referred to by many people, especially comedians! Martin Scorsese, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Beautiful! 8/10"

Tommy DeVito nd Karen Hill Rocks! so does Scorsese,, as usual,, despite my dissatisfaction..."
kosmasp,"May 24, 2020",10/10,"I re-watched this right before I watched the Irishman, kind of made this a double bill. And while I was aware of how great this is, it is always worth revisiting. What a great movie (based on true events and characters - not a bad thing) this is! Awesome performances all around and a story that is quite engaging. Crime does not pay in the end ... could be one of the messages.It is mesmerizing and you can understand why people are fascinated by it of course. But we get to see quite the brutal and violent face of it. Joe Pesci and his very (in)famous ""You think I'm funny"" scene is something to behold. Dangerous and funny - if you'll excuse the pun.Ray Liotta and De Niro doing their thing and reeling the audience in. I thought I was out, and they get me back in, to paraphrase another famous actor not involved in this. As crime movies go, you can argue this being the best. If not quite up there though ... and the message is clear, even if heightened."
Hitchcoc,"Apr 30, 2010",10/10,"I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named ""Spider"" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with ""normal"" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch."
kingchump666,"May 3, 2006",10/10,"Quite simply one of the greatest movies of all time, the Deniro Scorcese partnership in full flow Pesci is absolute genius Liota inspired,and Sorvino well it was the role he was born to play. The casting is inspired the editing the best in Film history and the narrating even inspired the Shawshank redemption. Its iconic, slick, cool, over violent and sickening all screwed into one great movie. There's really nothing else that need be said about this film which is perhaps the greatest ever and in my opinion far superior to the great yet overrated godfather. It's just absolutely flawless, and if pushed to find one i'd say its the fact that the budget isn't large enough"
george.schmidt,"Mar 31, 2003",N/A,"GOODFELLAS (1990) **** Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Mike Starr,  Michael Imperioli, Kevin Corrigan.  Martin Scorsese's blockbuster masterpiece look at the world of organized crime based on the true-life account of Henry Hill (excellently portrayed by Liotta) and his life lessons in the Mob.  Chilling and unflinchingly violent and funny (both thanks to a disturbing Pesci, Best Supporting Actor, as an out-of-control wiseguy). Brilliant direction and strong performances, as well as its nostalgic production values.  Memorable Steadicam shot of The Copacabana in New York and Pesci's ""I'm funny"" uneasy scene."
mrdestroyer2001,"Apr 24, 2019",7/10,"Who would you call a nice guy? Probably a work colleague who, to the detriment of his time, agrees to drink a glass of beer with you and listen to crazy talk about lost love. And after the third glass of beer it becomes clearly clear to you that this is, in general, a nice guy. The heroes of this film will not negotiate with you, will not show understanding, and if you owe something to these people, then death becomes not the worst way out of this situation. This is a film about the life of the mafia .Even when Henry was in school, he saw how simple it all goes to people from the "" family "". They robbed, cheated and even killed people, but their opinions did not change. They were afraid, and therefore - respected. They were not afraid of anyone and they had good reason. Naturally, young Henry was struck by such a life, and in his heart he had long since matured in order to start his own criminal career and, finally, to become a real gangster. And this story is dedicated to his ascent, his victories and his collapse.Despite the fact that the events of the film occur predominantly in the 70s of the last century, this picture makes us recall our nostalgic memories of the unforgettable computer game "" Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven "", where events took place in the 30s. In addition to the general atmosphere in these works of art, some scenes from the film frankly migrated to the screens of computer monitors. Remarkable is the fact that the protagonist of the film - Ray Liotta was subsequently involved in the sound of Tommy Angelo - the main character of the already mentioned game.According to many sites that are directly related to the field of cinema, and some film magazines, "" Glorious guys "" - this is the most realistic film about the mafia ever created. In this aspect, it is difficult for me not to agree with them, when scenes of beatings, which the Godfather trilogy and the painting Once Upon a Time in America often neglected, are often swept across the frame. Martin Scorsese took the story based on real events, reworked it into a script, and created from it not a banal tale about the mafia, but a hard interesting film that is worth watching several times.Henry . The protagonist of the film, through whose eyes we see everything that happens in the film. His character performed by Ray Liotta is laconic and not too emotional. But this does not mean that he is boring. His acting potential is revealed closer to the second half of the film, when Henry's life begins to lose its former stability, and now he has to really survive in order to stay afloat.Jimmy I have already seen so many films with the participation of Robert De Niro that it would seem there is nothing surprising. This actor perfectly showed a variety of images, from comedies to strong dramas. And yet, Robert is surprised. He is fully revealed in the film. His character is a gangster with experience, who has engaged himself in all areas of the criminal life of society. His preference is robbery, however, if necessary, he is capable of anything, including murder.Tommy . The brightest character in this movie. In all likelihood, this is the best role played by Joe Pesci . Here he was given a real revelation, which cannot be said about such paintings as "" Home Alone "" or "" Deadly Weapon "". His character is small, obviously with a chronic neurosis, a gangster, with a complex youthful fate, who is very proud of what he has achieved. He does not allow anyone to insult himself, while he will allow himself clearly more than acceptable, at any convenient occasion grabbing a knife or a gun. It is necessary to mention that this is also a very talkative, and therefore very funny character. Honored Oscar for Best Supporting Role.The director of the film, Martin Scorsese , the author of such masterpiece films like Gangs of New York and the Oscar-winning ""The Departed, "" created a film that perfectly complements Godfather , telling the most tough and interesting story about the life of the mafia. I recommend viewing this film to anyone who likes masterpieces, to all sincere cinema fans, since this is a really interesting film, which doesn't need a half-hour buildup at a time of two and a half hours. The film clings from the first minutes and releases at the moment when the final credits are on the screen.Watch it ..."
calcaylor,"Jan 2, 2006",1/10,"By one of the most overrated directors ever. Mindless, incoherent, unceasing violence. Narration is almost always a bad idea in a movie and this movie is no exception. A little narration can be okay but when it is such a dominant part of a movie, it subtracts and doesn't add. But, more importantly, about half way through, I was sickened by all the violence AND depravity that I just couldn't stomach any more and basically ""skimmed"" (fast forwarding about 5 minutes to watch 30 seconds, repeatedly) to the end just trying to see something redeemable that would validate all the unwarranted hullabaloo that was given this piece of crap.The shame is that Scorcese has the ability to make great movies that include violence and violent personalities (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) but these are exceptions which everyone seems to remember and not the stinkers like The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of Christ or Goodfellas."
lee_eisenberg,"Sep 29, 2005",10/10,"Watching ""Goodfellas"", you certainly get the feeling that Martin Scorsese had wanted to make this movie for a long time. Thank God that he finally got to; it was probably his best movie up to that time. It shows the mafia world through the eyes of up-and-comer Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) is Henry's main entry point into the mafia, but Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is also something else. Needless to say, there is a LOT of violence (well duh; this movie's about crime), but none of it gratuitous.You may have heard of Joe Pesci's ""How am I funny?"" speech. Let's just say that you have to see it to believe it. In fact, you have to see the whole movie to believe it. And to get a feeling of Martin Scorsese at his best."
Tweekums,"Aug 5, 2019",10/10,"This film tells the story of Irish/Italian mobster Henry Hill; from the early days when he worked for mobsters as a teenager in the 1950s, through the sixties and seventies to his arrest in the eighties. We see the ease with which he slips into this world; the rewards and dangers it brings. During this time he works with fellow mobsters James Conway and the psychotic Tommy DeVito; he also marries Karen. While Henry isn't a killer he isn't unaware of the violent side of their business.This is often described as the greatest mob movie; I can't say that but only because there are other very well-known mob movies that I have yet to see. The story is gripping from start to finish; there are moments of humour which frequently turn to extreme danger in the blink of an eye; this is usually due to Tommy's hair-trigger temper. The violence is usually sudden and bloody; as a character points out they don't waste time talking before they waste somebody. The cast is brilliant; Joe Pesci stands out as Tommy, it is hardly surprising that he picked up an Oscar. Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro are great as Henry and James; also particularly notable are Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill and Paul Sorvino as ""Paulie"" Cicero, the mobster Henry works for. Overall I'd say that this film is a must see for fans of the genre."
JLeckie,"Sep 4, 1998",10/10,"Probably the finest film of the past decade, Goodfellas has all the ingredients of a perfect movie. An excellent script, a soundtrack which is as memorable as the film itself and unforgettable character acting - especially by De Niro and Pesci. Scorcese makes the world of the 'Wiseguy' as appealing and exciting as Francis Ford Coppola did in his Godfather masterpieces, with the added bonus of rapid fire dialogues. Whereas one may remember single lines from The Godfather, any fan of Goodfellas would be able to recite entire conversations, such as the 'What am I, a clown?'... A perfect movie."
smatysia,"Jun 7, 2000",9/10,"One of the best Mob movies ever. Robert De Niro can always look dangerous. Ray Liotta, as always, looks like a total weasel. Good casting. Lorraine Bracco was great here, as was Paul Sorvino. But the real performance came from Joe Pesci, as the Academy recognized. I first saw him as the buffoon in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word, look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods, rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.NOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good. The voiceovers and music are very loud, and the regular dialogue much too soft. It had me adjusting the volume throughout. C'mon, guys, for what DVD's cost, you can do better than that."
gordito,"Sep 15, 1998",10/10,"Goodfellas isn't just some movie that portrays the mob in a typical city. They have a purpose, they have reasons, they have fun for crying out loud. I will say right now I've been sitting here for half an hour trying to figure how to explain the movie and I think I realized I can't. If you've never seen the movie then I seriously suggest you rent it, it's definitely worth the few dollars' charge. If you liked Casino or Reservoir Dogs then you'll love this movie."
iluvmuslims,"Oct 28, 2007",10/10,"Scorsese has combined ambigiuos camera angles and solid acting to make the greatest movie of all time.To the set pieces and costumes and the script, this stands alone as the greatest.With real events and deep characters,Goodfellas surpasses the age of time and reaches the limits of movie-making.Ray Liotta is a funny,charismatic Henry Hill who seems to love the gangster life style and its rewardsJoe Pesci shows how maniacal senses and unstable actions can make a great movie characterRob Deniro is at his best with Jimmy Conway.Not only is his acting on par with the greats(Brando)but shows real emotion"

Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco both give incredible performances and Joe Pesci and Robert De Nero are both perfect even though they look too old for their characters age in earlier scenes. Martin Scorsese's direction is amazing and it's extremely well filmed and well paced, skillfully navigating three decades coherently and effectively. The soundtrack is fantastic."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 18, 2024",5/10,"The answer is no. After seeing the hype of the movie and many people saying that ""Goodfellas"" is better than ""THE GODFATHER,"" I watched this movie last night and I say, how can people compare this movie with the epic THE GODFATHER? ""Goodfellas"" is not that great to compare with THE GODFATHER; ""Goodfellas"" is just okay. It's way out of the league to compare with THE EPIC GODFATHER. ""Goodfellas"" is just another average crime/drama film. Why I'm saying that is written in the brief review below:As a cinema lover, I approached ""Goodfellas"" with high expectations, but I found it to be more of a chore than an engaging experience. While the film is praised for its direction and performances, I felt it lacked a compelling narrative and character depth.The pacing was all over the place, making the story feel drawn out and occasionally boring. Instead of building tension, the lengthy sequences often left me disinterested. The characters, while well-acted, were largely unlikable and failed to evoke any empathy. I found myself struggling to connect with their motivations and choices.Furthermore, the glamorization of organized crime felt troubling. Instead of presenting a balanced view, the film often romanticizes a lifestyle of violence and betrayal, which can send the wrong message to impressionable viewers.""Goodfellas"" didn't live up to the hype for me. It's certainly a cinematic technical achievement, but I was left feeling indifferent by the end. It's a film that may resonate with some, but for others, it falls flat."
rockybalboa2430,"Jun 28, 2005",10/10,"Goodfellas is one of the top movies in the history of cinema, nominated for best picture (and five other Oscars) considered by many the top movie of the 90s, so how can it be underrated.put simply, it is underrated because the Godfather (parts I and II) are so brilliant. The sad thing is that, because Goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. The only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the Godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the Godfather are complete rip offs of the Godfather, but every once in a while a movie like Goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when I say, written off, I mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the Godfather. Many people admire it for what it is, but if the Godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films."
dannytrejo-09677,"Mar 9, 2024",10/10,"There have been many great gangster movies. Public Enemy, Angels With Dirty Faces, Godfather 1 & 2, Casino, Donnie Brasco. And many others. But Goodfellas is #1. The way the story is told by Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) is superb. The acting by Liotta, Joe Pesci (Tommy), Paul Sorvino (Paulie), Lorraine Bracco (Karen) and Robert De Niro as Jimmy are all great. Even the supporting cast, everyone knocked it out of the park in this film. Robert De Niro was excellent as Jimmy Conway, a cold blooded killer. The music, the talk, the wardrobe, the vehicles. This movie never gets old. My favorite movie ever."

vincew9298,"May 31, 2002",8/10,"When I saw ""Goodfellas"" I knew everything that was going to happen because it was based on a book called ""Wise Guys"" that I had read a few years before. Though I knew what was coming I was pleased with the acting, at it's best. The character were developed and depicted in a way that I though made them almost like heros. Some, like Pesci's , were amusing and sometimes funny. Conway was presented in a truer light, and I think that only an actor of DeNiro's caliber was capable of showing James Conway as the truly mean and vicious person he was in life. Henry Hill and his wife Karen are presented almost as victims and one could almost feel sorry for them. It's hard not to like Lorraine Bracco in any role she plays and I wish that they had cast someone not as likable as her as Mrs Hill. I, being involved in law enforcement for nearly twenty-five years saw them as criminals. The scenes depicted in the jails was as true to life as possible. I just feel that the way the criminals are made into heroes is a bad message to present to young people. More of the needless murder and suffering, the survivors family and loved ones left to pick up the pieces are neglected and ignored. Henry committing felonies on a daily basis, Karen living a glamorous life, and when they finally get caught and ready to be sent to jail, where they belong, become outstanding citizens by informing on their friends. Hill and his wife are no better than any of the others that committed felonies, condoned and participated in murder, robbery, assault, drug dealing and extortion. The flaw is that these characters are made to be sympathetic victims. It wasn't poor Henry's fault that for as long as he could remember he wanted to be a criminal. It wasn't Karen's fault that she felt all the glamour surrounding a life of extortion and theft. Her mother, presented as a mean interfering woman was another victim as was her father, presented as sickly and spineless. They truly suffered, seeing their daughter getting involved in a life with such trash. A message sent to young people that this type of life is fun, great and carefree is not a good message. Lets face it, Hill continues to be a criminal, even if not on the same scale he still goes into stores and steals from the shelf and we, the general public,  have to make up for the vendors lose because of this. Let's present the characters for what they are. Poor Tommy being murdered because he resented being shot by a mean coward. A man trying to make a living running a nightclub having his business being stolen or a poor mailman making his daily round sand being assaulted for doing what he was suppose to do, deliver the mail to the addressee and so many more depicted in the movie not as victims but as an occasional ship passing in the night and happening to be passing a barge filled with garbage. The movie is entertaining, but lets not forget that in real life these characters left a trail of victims and so much unnecessary hurt."
Doylenf,"Dec 1, 2007",7/10,"Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese turns GOODFELLAS into an engrossing gangster saga that provides a lot of intense actors with some meaty acting roles--among them, RAY LIOTTA (""I always wanted to be a gangster""), JOE PESCI, ROBERT DeNIRO, LORRAINE BRACCO and PAUL SORVINO.The strong narrative follows the career of a youth, Henry Hill (RAY LIOTTA), an Irish lad living in a neighborhood ruled by the Italian Mafia who wants the easy life of crime and money and fancy cars and life in the fast lane. He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.It's a film very similar in theme to ""The Godfather"", but not quite up to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning supporting role.If you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory ""crime does not pay"" conclusion. All of the performances are first rate and there's seldom a dull moment thanks to a soundtrack that includes a lot of pop songs of the period."
weensy,"Nov 28, 2001",5/10,"I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a Scorsese flick since."

There is no fluff, or a single line that is superfluous or that sounds improbable.As great as De Niro and Pesci are, my pick for best actor is Ray Liotta. His frantic, borderline sociopathic, personable smooth-talking wiseguy turn as Henry Hill is in my top ten of all time great portrayals. Michael Madsen almost got the role and would have been great, but I think too menacing. Ray Liotta had the balance of vulnerability, charm, and violent thug vibe that made him Henry Hill. He was the pivot point between De Niro's calculating Jimmy and Pesci's cowboy Tommy. Perfection.And the soundtrack - oh my - where did Martin Scorsese find the inspiration? Great tunes that transport you right to the 60s and into the 70s without even realizing it.It's sad that Dances With Wolves one best picture in 1990, because while not a bad movie, it didn't have the realism or impact that Goodfellas had for me."

LeonLouisRicci,"Jan 5, 2013",10/10,"It is a great Movie that can have you believing what you saw was not what you saw. It is the genius of Advertising and The Con. Contrary to popular belief this is not a glamorization of The Mob or their lifestyle, in fact, it is just the opposite. No matter how much the narrator/main Character tells us how attractive it is and how desirable it is to be a Wiseguy, the Film denies this in almost every scene.It is the rhythm, the staccato of it all that hypnotizes us into believing what he is saying, but not what is actually occurring. The pulsating Music Soundtrack and the uncanny mesmerizing voice over lulls the Audience into a false sense of a wanting place. It is the work of the Devil. Or at least a devilishly good Film-Maker.There is nothing attractive here. The People are ugly and unpleasant and constantly do ugly and unpleasant things. The Sets are mundane, gaudy and unattractive, as are the clothes. There is not one appealing aspect to any of this Photo-Play. Yet, Audiences are led by this pied piper Scorsese into the rat-a-tat-tat ruminations of a heel and a turncoat and they actually care about this crumb.Such is the magical work of a Movie Maker obsessed with style that cannot be denied His Craft. This is a fugazi. A manipulative Movie. A sinful master work that is a temptation worthy of a great deceiver."

Legendary....!"
pbertovich05,"Dec 17, 2007",10/10,"Goodfellas is just one of those movies. It has everything from great directing and acting to awesome music and memorable comic moments. In this case, the directing is by Scorsese and the acting by Deniro, Pesci and Liotta so its all superb. Throughout the movie you get the classic comedy that comes along with Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro and some great music to go along with all these great scenes. A lot of people claim that the godfather is the greatest movie of all time. To me, watching Goodfellas is just as engrossing but more fun to watch thanks to Pesci, Deniro and Liotta. Goodfellas is just one of those movies that movie critics can enjoy, but so can your average movie watcher."
strandbrand,"Aug 24, 2022",10/10,"This film has aged like a fine wine, now packing as much punch as it did 30 years ago. If you enjoy mob mafia style movies then this is the one you have been waiting for."
adamonIMDb,"May 21, 2017",10/10,"The first title that will come to most people's mind when thinking of mafia films is inevitably 'The Godfather' - a timeless classic that many consider to be the greatest movie of all time. However, as good as 'The Godfather' is, there's something about 'Goodfellas' that I enjoy more.Maybe it's the way the story is told, or the fact that the violence in 'Goodfellas' is a lot more ruthless and brutal. It also has more entertainment value compared to the plot-heavy Godfather. Whatever the reason, 'Goodfellas' is a film I enjoy immensely and is up there as one of my favourites in the crime genre.Aside from the story, 'Goodfellas' is a near perfect piece of filmmaking, with a witty and intelligent script, brilliant acting throughout, and terrific cinematography. 'Goodfellas' is a near flawless movie."
evanhassell,"Sep 12, 2025",6/10,"At first I was really interested (first 40 or so minutes) to see where this was going. It was set up to be great. I understand it's based on a true story so it is held back a little bit by having to somewhat stay in line with what happened.But thats the thing. Nothing happened. Like, literally, nothing happened.There were many dramatic events, yes. People died, there were scenes filled with anxiety. But it led nowhere. Its like the old guy that talks your ear off about their life story and just gives bits and pieces of multiple events that happened without connecting them and going nowhere in the end with it. You're interested at first and then lose interest.The ending was meh. It was pretty predictable (like the rest of the movie) once getting there and felt extremely rushed compared to the rest of the movie. Again, they threw the ending in as another ten minute sequence on top of the other 15 ten minute sequences without REALLY showing anything special to connect them all. And then it was just ""the end"".Really shocked by all the praise this movie gets. Not ""bad"" by any means. Its entertaining, funny, and well acted but the overarching story (or lack thereof) was a miss and didn't meet that excitement i went into the movie with."
mr_tambourine_man72,"Aug 9, 2004",1/10,"Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short.Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality.Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art.Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you."
jaidynrag,"Jun 26, 2019",10/10,"This here is the greatest movie in film history. The acting is absolutely off the charts. De Niro and Pesci in incredible supporting roles with Liotta taking the spotlight, and earning his place. Scorsese really knew what he was doing with every scene in the movie."
yls-39525,"Jun 23, 2020",10/10,"The gradual transition from Romanticism to reality is just in line with the audience's perception changes in the process of understanding the gangster's life. To see the big from the small, there is no epic spirit of godfather, but there is a sense of immersive. The final result is beyond the fatalism."
jonathanr-67660,"Feb 16, 2025",10/10,"I recently watched Goodfellas for the first time and just like The Godfather, I was blown away by how good it was. This is easily going to be one of my all-time favorite movies and I honestly can't think of a single thing wrong with it.As of writing this, I haven't seen many of Martin Scorsese's movies but from what I've heard, he is a legend and this movie proves it without a reasonable doubt. This film is a biopic about a mobster named Henry Hill and his friends Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito, played by Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci respectively. It spans 25 years in his life of crime, and what I love about this movie is that unlike other biopics, it follows the same structure of any film that isn't based on a true story. If there's one man that can make this happen, its Scorsese. Much of the film is narrated by Liotta himself and while the dialogue is dirty, it fits the tone of the film perfectly. It also has some narration done by Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's wife Karen. This is an interesting choice because it allows us to see the story from the perspectives of more than one character. Every character performance is nothing short of phenomenal. It's also very entertaining which makes it hard to find a good moment to pause on, you'll just want to keep watching till the very end. Every scene is fun to watch and it makes you want to live in their world too and join them in their activities. Another thing I liked was the first act of the film where Henry is a teenager because the actors for the younger versions of Henry and Tommy looked just like Liotta and Pesci. It was so convincing. And just like The Godfather, it portrays Italian Americans in a positive light even though crime is one of the core themes.All in all, Goodfellas really is a Good movie, and definitely one of the greatest of all time and the pinnacle of Scorsese's filmmaking. If you haven't seen this movie, please do because it is one of few films I can describe as ""flawless""."
Snoopy1,"Aug 4, 2004",10/10,"One of my favorite movies, ever.The plot is fascinating, each of the scenes is extremely powerful, Scorsese did a phemonenal job directing, and the acting is amazing.  Joe Pesci's character is one of the scariest characters I've ever seen on film or TV. Robert DeNiro is, as usual, terrific, and Ray Liotta plays his part perfectly.The movie is over 2 hours long, but it goes by so quickly that you want to watch it all over again after it's over.The most chilling scene in the movie is the ""Layla"" scene...I've never felt that way about a scene in a movie before."
haymondjay,"Jun 22, 2023",9/10,"My all time favourite gangster movie. Watched originally in the 90s. And continue to watch it regularly. What a superb movie. Absolutely love the main cast of Ray Liotta, Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. The narration, humour, shocking scenes. It has it all. I don't know why gangster movies have this fascination factor. Likely because most of us want to see that life without consequences.I'm grateful this film was made and can be enjoyed occasionally as I grow old. So many great scenes. Some you chuckle, some you are in fear, others you just enjoy. Without a doubt my top 3 films of the 90s."
tant-64989,"Jan 22, 2020",10/10,"Yeah i said so, and that's a fact, love everything in this movie, have watched it 3 times already and still want to rewatch it"
KIDOLOHKEN,"Nov 6, 2019",9/10,"If the actor who appeared was DiCaprio or Brad Pitt, I would have thought this would be a Tarantino movie.
I thought that the composition of the story of this movie and the atmosphere of the movie was very similar to Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Especially the first half hour. The camera moved very well, and it was difficult for the audience to get bored at the same time. The shooting is very admirable. Each picture is very beautiful. It was beautiful because it was a film. There is characteristic music everywhere. How to use how music is very wonderful. Inundation of music.
The camerawork, photography and music symphony attracted us. If you look at the other films of this director, the scripts are always never a masterpiece. We screenwriters shouldn't try to learn scripts from this director. However. Though, the minimum elements that do not get the customer bored are included in the script.
Overall of those is very similar to Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I was surprised that the great movie had such a good example. And I think that the director's true greatness is to discover a new atmosphere like this movie."
dstanwyck,"Jul 9, 2015",6/10,"I didn't read more than a few other reviews and they were all 10 stars. I'm going to be the fly in the ointment and give it a 7, which still ain't bad. And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little ""f"" word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination). Aside from that - there were moments in the film that were clearly wonderful. Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing. Etc. A story told well enough in all of its pathetic realism. Scorcese is usually very good. It's this film that wasn't."
johnshephard80,"Mar 8, 2007",1/10,"Here in Crete Greece there are many films shown during the night on TV so my wife and I use the users comments to decide which films to record to watch at a decent hour. This film being 19th in the top 250 film was a must to record.Without a doubt this is a well made film, with atmospheric photography and very good acting. The violence which we saw although harsh was artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40 minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it. We could not relate to any or the characters in the film nor did we care what happened to them. So we turned it off and deleted it to make space for another film."
celebrityprune,"Mar 24, 2022",10/10,Joe Pesci makes a film in one incredibly brilliant scene showing how funny and intimidating his character actually is. Worth the time for Pesci alone.
Bigweight66,"Jan 25, 2021",10/10,"The best gangster movie ever made for mine. A superstar cast with De Niro, Liotta and Pesci at their very best, with a very solid and good supporting cast. Based on a true story, the movie follows some friends from their teenage years into adulthood. Their journey is a treacherous and murderess one, as they become involved with the Mafia. These Goodfellas live a lavish lifestyle, but after years of greed and corruption eventually their world comes crashing down. The story is interesting and well told, there's plenty of detail, but no overkill. The main characters all have a strong presence, at times they are likable, but don't be fooled. There is lots of double cross's, violence and shootings which is part of the territory in a tale like this."
TheRedRex,"Feb 3, 2023",10/10,"Godfellas in many ways represents the peak of Martin Scorsese's career as a filmaker. It is a classic in the truest sense of the word. Rarely have I ever seen a film that is as consistently memorable and captivating as Goodfellas. This is due to a variety of reasonsThe acting from all the major characters in this film is unbelievably good. The characters of Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry (played by Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Ray Liotta respectively) in particular are given larger than life, commanding preformances by their respective actors that do wonders to keep the audience on the edge of their seats for long periods of time.The direction and cinematography of Goodfellas is thoroughly exceptional. The camerawork is remarkably engrossing, almost acting as it's own character. The camera in this movie is constantly moving, relentlessly stalking the characters, and it is used masterfully to heighten the suspense and drama of many key moments throughout the story. There are also many unforgettable set pieces throughout the film which perfectly convey just how unforgiving and frantic the life of a Mobster is.The screenplay and writing of the characters is also absolutely stellar. The characters are cleverly written and portrayed so that they are undoubtedly evil and amoral, but not amoral enough to not get invested in their survival. The scenes of dialogue between the characters are also unbelievably tense, and nail biting, to the point that it can feel very hard to watch.The entire pace of this film is incredibly fast and unrelenting. There is NEVER a dull moment at any point during Goodfellas. There is always something going on and the film grabs your attention and holds it like few others.Overall, Goodfellas is, in my opinion, Scorsese's masterpiece. It is a iconic classic of the gangster genre and a watching it is an experience that you will never forget."
NikkiA-26,"Aug 15, 2025",10/10,"Great piece of storytelling and iconic acting.Depiction of monster/gangster life, the comedy as well as being gritty & an un-romanticised view into Henry Hills chaotic life being a gangster and wife Karen's life being married to it.What's not to love, ""Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guy in movies"".Let alone iconic lines from the movie it is witty, dark and Scorsese approach to dramatic impact doesn't disappoint, still.and a great soundtrack.Even Animaniacs 'Goodfeathers' came out of it, which my younger sibling said he couldn't wait to watch Goodfellas.All from a story, based on the true memoir Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi and one of a few movies that brings an adaptation alight on screen for our senses."
proudlypatriotic,"Apr 11, 2023",10/10,"Seriously one of my very favorite movies. It grabs you from the start and doesn't let you go until the end - at which point you want MORE, MORE, MORE. There are not many mob movies that can touch this one. Believable and absorbing.The acting is superb. Cannot decide which performance I like better. Although I have to say Joe Pesci does steal a couple of scenes BIG TIME.What a job by Ray Liotta - as strong as De Niro's acting is and was in this film, I think Ray did better. However, both are stellar - never losing character for a second.Deserving of all 10 of my stars. Not many movies are! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.... THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!!!"
marwanF9,"Oct 13, 2022",10/10,"What exactly am I talking about and where do I start..... I had an experience in this movie that will not be repeated no matter how many films I watched.... The acting was very wonderful.. The greatest performance of Ray Liotta in his acting career.... Joe Beshi who kills me from laughter And Robert Deenera, who is well known in Scorsese's films... An international cinematography, and although the story is very simple, Scorsese presented it in a very wonderful way.. Wonderful shots and very great acting.... I am sure that any gangster movie that came out after Goodfellas has benefited From it in any way... a wonderful movie in every sense of the word 10/10 without a doubt."
Aditya_Gokhale,"Jan 17, 2006",10/10,"This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone.""Goodfellas"" is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the mafia and its operations. Comparisons to ""The Godfather"" movies are inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their respective places and deal with separate stories; ""The Godfather"" movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone Crime family, while ""Goodfellas"" is a portrayal of the life of the mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family might want done! Also, ""Goodfellas"" has more of a ""jolly"" mood throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of triumph every time they pull off a job! ""The Godfather"" movies on the other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to story-telling.""Goodfellas"" is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino).The movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and Tommy, carries out a number of heists.All throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete fun, with things going their way all the time! It's only towards the end that things start to fall apart....There are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics and only get better with repeated viewings; there's some very witty and fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci).Acting: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci (awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino. Lorraine Bracco is superb as Henry's wife, Karen.Wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted, this thoroughly entertaining movie is a must-see! One of Martin Scorsese's best, along with ""Raging Bull""."
antonio12,"Aug 24, 2018",6/10,"Somewhere between De Niro's overacting, Lorraine Braccos's underacting, Liotta's bad acting and a bad script, I find this the most overrated movie ever. Honestly, how this is rated so high is beyond me. Especially considering the fact there are hundreds of movies similar to this, ten times better."
johnnymonsarrat,"May 27, 2002",4/10,"I admit it; I'm an action movie guy. So a film about the mafia should be right up my alley. But I'm often turned off by dramas. It's not that I don't respect those who like fine art. I do. But personally, I lack the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable.That's what gets in my way when I watch Goodfellas, which I've seen twice now but couldn't get through it the 2nd time. The protagonists are nasty and I couldn't identify with them. This is the same thing that turned me off watching ""Pulp Fiction"".Superb acting, story, some real drama -- but how ugly and why would I want to watch this?Who should see this film:-- art types / drama lovers: a must-see-- action movie types who don't mind when the protagonist is violent and awfulSorry, but at least I've stated some real reasons for giving Goodfellas only a 4 out of 10."
eskimosound,"Jun 27, 2020",10/10,"Scorsese, Liotta, DeNiro, Pesci....the combination is awesome. Based on a true story, this is easily the best Gangster Movie ever made. Scorsese did 3 Big Gangster movies that are loosely connected.
Goodfellas, Casino and The Irishman. All are epic, no one does a Gangster movie like Scorsese and no one plays Mobsters like DeNiro and Pesci."

MadeOfScars,"Sep 1, 2006",10/10,"This is a really, really good Mafia movie. This movie ranks right up there close with the Godfather movies. I think this movie actually seemed a little more realistic than the Godfather. But don't get me wrong, it's still no Godfather. De Niro, Pesci, and Liotta were all great. Every time I see Pesci I think Mafia stooge; that's just the way he comes off in all his movies. He plays his role to perfection. He definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro was fantastic too, although this wasn't the normal role he plays. He was still a tough guy in this movie, but he was really paranoid throughout the whole thing. Every time I saw him on screen I could tell how badly he wanted in ""the family"", so he played that part perfectly. If the Godfather movies had never been made, then this would be the top Mafia movie out there."
erinok-85232,"Jan 1, 2021",9/10,"This film is amazing, the cast is great and this has got to be one of the best mob movies ever. i like it because it's so smart, funny and drama at the same time. the acting is great, the plot is great and overall an amazing film. go watch it! you will not regret it!"
questl-18592,"Mar 18, 2020",6/10,"Another in a series of movies from my list of shame that I'm catching up on. I'd never seen this, but knew some of the famous lines, which is no surprise given the popularity and high status this movie has.Sadly, I grew up knowing Pesci from Home Alone and Gone Fishin' and My Cousin Vinny. I never caught him in these career defining roles. The man is terrifying with the intensity he brings. De Niro I knew from Meet the Parents and Stardust, I never got to experience the powerhouse performances. Ray Liotta.. I've seen him in stuff but he never made much impression on me. Aside from the big three, everyone in this is solid, there's no bad performances bringing it down.Sadly, I think this suffers because I've seen other gangster movies. This feels sooooo much like every other mob movie. A lower grade Godfather, a less stylish Pulp Fiction, not as epic as The Irishman, and not as The Departed, it doesn't even explore the taxing nature of these lives as well Donnie Brasco. Almost all of these follow a young man coming up in the mob, loving it at first and then suffering for it.What Goodfellas has gong for it is a collection of exceptional moments. The overall movie may feel oddly derivative to me but there's no doubt that some scenes are exceptional. It's definitely an odd experience because I know this predates almost all of those but that's not been my experience and it definitely suffers in my eyes because of it."
Horror-yo,"Mar 31, 2016",3/10,"You read around and you see ""Joe Pesci's best performance"", ""Masterpiece"", ""Scorsese at his best"", ""Classic mobster movie"", ""cinematographic perfection""... seriously these people are just mad. This is literally as follows: this guy shoots this guy, that guy shoots that guy, then this guy shoots this guy, for no reason, then this guy shoots that guy...I swear it just goes on and on. There's absolutely nothing that isn't linear, flat and dull about this film, it's just event after event, nothing subtle, ever, nothing about the state of mind of the characters, human condition, interesting dialog, nothing nothing nothing. De Niro is okay but widely anonymous. Liotta overplays a bit. Pesci's character is embarrassing (I know it's a biography, but still).It's interesting really because it shows all people want is mafia violence, they just like to watch the event of homicide, doesn't matter how/where/who/when... It's looooooooooooong. It never ends. And it's so incredibly irrelevant. I tried to see the good about it. Nahh....nah this is just garbage.And of course Scorsese picks the easy way out choosing to make this: just pick a mobster's real life story, put 3 renowned actors, write a dull screenplay, and film it. Everybody will love it: it's got De Niro, violence, mafia atmosphere, and the name Scorsese. This is just disgustingly bad taste."
snoozejonc,"Nov 2, 2023",10/10,"The life and times of Henry Hill and his mob association.'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorsese's classic adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's book that combines brilliant visuals, memorable dialogue and great performances.I think the subject is a matter of taste based on how much interest you have in violent criminals. The social constructions that attract certain types of people to the lifestyle is one of the strongest aspects and is portrayed in a fairly seductive way by the filmmakers. However, the extreme violence, greed, selfishness, and disloyalty of the main characters is rightly emphasised in scenes that linger in the memory.It is notable for naturalistic and entertaining dialogue that stems from improvisation during rehearsals. Virtually all characters have the opportunity to contribute and there are so many memorable lines it is hard to pick favourites.Visually for me it is a masterpiece. There is so much iconic cinematography, perfectly cut together and enhanced by music from the era. Michael Ballhaus and Thelma Schoonmaker are as much the stars as the actors. I never tire of watching that walkthrough at the Copacabana.Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco are all amazing. However, Joe Pesci stands out as a terrifyingly murderous ""funny guy"".It is one of those films that is too good in some ways. It has such an impact that it prompts life to imitate art. Just like 'Jaws' made people go out and kill sharks, I know of 'Goodfellas' fans who emulate the mannerisms and personality traits of characters like Tommy, Paulie and Jimmy (minus the brutal murders) because they think its cool. An unfortunate side affect of a great movie of which some individuals miss the point."
filmcriticandreview,"Mar 13, 2021",9/10,I believe this is the best mafia movie ever made. I loved The Godfather and Godfather 2 but this film I enjoyed even more. Top notch acting all the way through. This film will keep you engaged from the first second to the last. Not recommended for children but for adults who enjoy a look at the past during the hey day of the mafia in Las Vegas and America then this film is a must see.
benbraddock-51767,"Aug 6, 2022",10/10,When you talk about your favourite film of all time or the best film ever made? In either discussion if Goodfellas is not mentioned? Then you either haven't seen it or you are so pretentious you shouldn't have an opinion.
RobJW92,"Jan 9, 2015",9/10,"The movie itself its notorious for being one of the best gangster films ever made. Centred on the book 'wise guy', it focuses on how Henry Hill a former gangster worked his way up through the mob family. Without reading the book I didn't know what to expect from the ending which I thought was brilliant.The combination of De Niro, Liotta and Pesci work excellent in this film as you witness them grow into the film as like brothers working under Paulie. I think this movie provides everything you would want to keep watching....Action, Romance, Suspense and even a bit of humour thrown in.Ultimately I would argue this as one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, its a must watch!"
Galina_movie_fan,"May 15, 2007",10/10,"What a wonderful inspiring film-making by the only director who could possible make the film, the undisputed classic. The cast is superb, the pace - incredible; 145 minutes simply flew by. My beloved ""Sopranos"", all six seasons of it could fit perfectly like in a case in these 145 minutes. Ultra-violent, mesmerizing, enthralling, ""GoodFellas"" is an unforgettable wild ride. I have not seen the film for a while and what a great fun it was to re-watch it again and I know it always will be.Favorite scene - after Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) killed Billy Batts, they and Henry Hill stopped at Tommy's mother (Mrs. Scorsese) house. The contrast between earlier horrifying scene at the bar and the nice family dinner is simply breathtaking."
TakeTwoReviews,"Oct 27, 2024",8/10,"Goodfellas is a terrifying film. This is why I've not rewatched it in decades. I'm here now because a meme reminded me of it, that's terrible reason to watch a film, but it's the truth and it's probably the truth that makes this terrifying. Although this is a dramatised account, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). ""As far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"", that's pretty much Henry's opening line as he shuts the trunk on a dead body killed by Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci) and that in a nutshell sums up the film. People tied together by violent crime. Henry is half Irish, half Italian. Growing up around the local gangsters, learning the ropes, making connections, making money, getting respect. This introduction to young Henry is important. It hammers home the family function of the mob. Once in, nothing penetrates it. It's bred into you. You'd die for each other. You'd kill too. Goodfellas is about more than killing and stealing though. It's about loyalty, vanity, masculinity. You can almost smell the screen. There's a tense underbelly to every scene. Be it Tommy's unhinged temper or Henry's greed. Henry narrates throughout. He meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco). To begin with she seems his equal and that's what he likes. Quickly she learns that Henry is dangerous, but she likes that too... and marries him. Once you're in. You can't get out. Not even if you want to. The dialogue is rapid, you feel like you're in a pressure cooker. The camera too is always on the move, but boy does it move beautifully. Through rooms, kitchens, everyday life and energy oozes from the screen. Let's not pretend it's not absolutely brutal though. Yes it's packed with style, yes it's the characters that make it tick, but when the guns are drawn, or the knives, clubs, anything to hand, it's bloody! Sooner or later, someone's going to make a mistake. Tommy is that someone and the mistake is the body in the trunk in the pre-titles scene. It's one of many mines planted in the story, buried ironically. Left, ticking. The mob lifestyle goes on, but these things are there. Remembered by those biding their time. Honestly it's not an easy watch. There's no good guys, the title is a total lie. Every single person on screen is a scumbag. After setting the scene for an hour, the scumbags start the infighting and the cracks begin to show. The genius of this though is how it keeps you hooked. The pacing is perfection. Henry encounters bumps, does time, his marriage on the rocks, but on it goes. He's digging deeper though and soon digging into coke against Paulie's (Paul Sorvino) wishes. Massive heists attract the FBI. Too many fingers in too many pies. Even as the trio of Henry, Jimmy and Tommy galvanise and try to cover their tracks, it's too late as things unravel to classic American needle drops. They thought they were safe. High enough up the food chain, but they've not spotted their vulnerability. It's a brilliant film from start to end, but you know what? That meme... it was from Casino!"
johnft,"Nov 16, 2018",6/10,"If viewers think this movie belongs in the same breath as The Godfather, they are sadly mistaken. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being best), I would rate Goodfellas a 6.0. The Godfather is an 11. The best thing going for Goodfellas is the casting of De Niro. He is perfectly cast as a tough gritty gangster. Joe Pesci should stick to comedy, i.e. My Cousin Vinny or Home Alone. Pesci is not convincing as a maniacal mobster. He is almost cartoonish. Pesci's Tommy DeVito versus Luca Brasi is a huge mismatch. Ray Liotta is mediocre as the character Henry Hill. Paul Sorvino plays his Mafia kingpin character as tongue-in-cheek. Don't compare him to Brando's Corleone. The musical score, screen play, cinematography and directing is slighly above average. AFI 2008 had this movie rated 92nd all time (way too high). BTW - they had The Godfather rated # 2 all time, one spot too low."
rupie,"May 20, 1999",3/10,"Here's a contrarian opinion: GOODFELLAS is to be avoided unless you have a strong stomach and a proclivity towards sadism. A basically tawdry and sleazy story about a tawdry and sleazy bunch of mobsters is turned into a garish comic strip that is never quite funny enough to overcome the truly revolting violence, which is portrayed in as hideous a manner as possible. It might be argued that Scorsese is trying to make a moral point here, but it just doesn't wash. A truly repulsive film."
tbickle-2,"Sep 24, 1998",10/10,"GoodFellas, one of my all time favorite movies, is put together in an incredible way.  The cinematography and editing is amazing.  The movie flows better than any movie I've ever seen.  Each shot goes into the next perfectly.  Also the sound and visual images are not cut at the same time in most places, smoothing out the transitions even more.  along with Taxi Driver, it is Scorsese's best picture.  Also, like most Scorsese films, the characters (perhaps with the exception of Tommy) although brutal criminals, are very accesible and understandable.  I can really relate to their feelings.  It is a truly great movie."
RayKarago,"Apr 28, 2015",10/10,"I remember that this is one of the first films that I've ever seen that deserved to be called a ""classic."" I was absolutely mind blown, I was even shocked that the film is two and a half hours long but had just been sucked in for so long.This film has some of the best acting you will ever see in your life. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who deserved his Oscar), Robert De Nero, Lorraine Bracco. Everybody was fantastic ! Everyone just deserved an Oscar. Ray Liotta and and Lorraine both gave effective and entertaining voice over narration and even the smaller roles from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson where entertaining.The music was incredible, there is no score, its more of a combination of famous songs from the 50's 60's and 70's (matching the decades in which the film is set) and they all work, none of the songs feel shoe-horned, and they all pleasant to listen to.This is Scorsese's best work, which is a big claim, and well earned. The shots were all great, including the tracking shot that has now become world famous and is taught in film schools all over the world. The use of lighting, the atmosphere were all at a level of perfection that only Scorsese can.This is one of my favorite films of all time."
kaaffilm,"Mar 25, 2023",10/10,"""Goodfellas"" is an all-time classic that is widely regarded as one of the greatest gangster films ever made. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, the movie tells the true story of Henry Hill, a small-time criminal who rises through the ranks of the Mafia. The film is a masterclass in filmmaking, with Scorsese's trademark kinetic energy and visual flair on full display. The performances are exceptional, particularly Pesci's unforgettable turn as the unhinged Tommy DeVito. The movie's fast-paced editing and iconic soundtrack make it a thrilling and immersive experience that captures the gritty reality of life in the mob. ""Goodfellas"" explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the corrupting influence of power, while also providing a darkly humorous commentary on the criminal underworld. It is a cinematic masterpiece that remains as thrilling and entertaining today as it was upon its release over 30 years ago."
finercreative,"Sep 29, 2024",9/10,"Yesterday, I watched Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" for the first time, and I must say, it's definitely up there on favorite crime movies.Joe Pesci gives off a terrific performance in the role of Tommy, and De Niro, Liotta, and the rest of cast also did very well.The whole movie plays out like a ""Godfather"" but with a cool and humorous spin on it, provided by the great writing and direction by Martin Scorsese. There's also some good set design, cinematography (especially with those master shots) and editing.Overall, it's a highly entertaining movie experience, and I'd highly recommend it. 9.25/10.Also, if you disagree with the opinions stated here, that's completely fine."

jackthepgl,"Aug 10, 2023",10/10,"Martin Scorsese was at his best when he made GoodFellas. It received five Oscar nominations and a winner for Best Supporting Actor for Joe Pesci. It's speechless for how great this movie was and it still is. GoodFellas is a fantastic crime drama and it's impeccably done throughout. The story is based on a true story ad it's taken place from 1955 to 1980. It tells a story about Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta narrating about his life as a gangster. Lorraine Bracco sometimes narrates as Karen Hill, aside from that, Ray Liotta does all the narrating. It's in the book. It's in the non-fiction book by Nicholas Pileggi called Wiseguy. Of course, everyone knows the scene where Henry tells Tommy that he is funny cause the way he tells stories and Tommy says ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" ""Funny how, I mean funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?"" This is a famous scene for Joe Pesci as his acting is incredible. As far as this film goes, this is a perfect film for everyone who is a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. It has a great story that is so true, fantastic Oscar winning acting by everyone who played great characters and best direction from Martin Scorsese. It's everyone's favourite film of all time and considered one of the greatest films of all time. Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."
rajdoctor,"Aug 4, 2007",7/10,"I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named ""Wise Guy"" written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco)  he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends  good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters  he loves to play.The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details.Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies  I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere  showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.Just a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.(Stars 7 out of 10)"
koustav,"Oct 29, 2003",5/10,"The movie showcases deniro and liotta at their best, with pesci acting in his usual gangster role. However the film is too long, without a tight plot for support. hence after watching for two hours, one starts wondering when the film is going to get over. while the film has some very funny and quite believable scenes, it ends up being another one of scorcese's film glamorising gangsterhood."
DirtyH85,"Feb 26, 2022",10/10,"One of the best of Scorsese. 10/10. Awesome script, good actin and cast. The absolute top spot in Ganster movies along side of Godfather trilogy. A modern classic among crime movies."

InlyCii,"Apr 16, 2020",8/10,"Like all gangster movies, the people trapped inside face the issue of life and death directly. In this tension, they are vented by madness. Even if they survive in the fight, their hearts step into darkness. In the end, no one can believe anyone. This can understand why they are so crazy. The tension of the gang comes from life and death, and the relationship is self-existing."
s-99188,"Apr 10, 2020",8/10,"This is an epic gangster blockbuster, the protagonist from childhood in the gap between the survival of a great weapon and then in the cruel and dangerous, the dream fell, finally the dream broken, finally died. The film narrates the protagonist's inner feelings and comments on the story that happened in the film by the way of narration. The director narrates through the lens this gang story is huge, the age is far away, from many aspects portrays many characters with different characters and distinctive characteristics. In the film Henry's gain and loss, scenery and desolation, but also let us watch the film at the same time feel a kind of loneliness and loss."
adamcfletcher-243-707764,"Jul 26, 2022",10/10,"One of the greater if not the greatest gangsta movie to grace the silver screen. Goodfellas unlike the godfather or godfather 2 that is considered by many the greatest mobster movies ever (not by me) is a true telling of a very real mob family through the eyes of Henry Hill ( Ray Liotta ). Robert de Niro is as always fantastic as is Ray Liotta a role that made his career and showed his talent as a versatile actor, but the stand out performance goes to Joe Pesci who in the same year had us in stitches as the bumbling thief in Hone Alone here puts on of the most terrifying performances that cements him in cinema history as one of the most dangerous and evil characters. This is a thrill ride of Henry Hill's rise and fall. Greatest gangster movie of all time."
PCC0921,"Jan 14, 2021",9/10,"If you have not seen the film, Goodfellas (1990), yet, make it a goal to do so. Robert De Niro was already a huge heavyweight in Hollywood when this film came out. Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta would become household names, once this film was released. Martin Scorsese used his skills, as a film auteur and editor, to craft an amazing piece of Mafia crime drama. It is based on true events and characters found in the book ""Wiseguy"". The film chronicles the story of Mafia associate Henry Hill JR. From the years 1955-1980.As you see young Henry grow up from selling and moving stolen cigarettes, to his days as an FBI informant, it is not the story that totally drives the film, but the execution by director Scorsese and the actors. It is an Academy Award winner that captures the feeling of the Mafia, as well as, the period pieces that it chronicles. Even though it takes place in a recent history, it still captures a charm from the olden days, which probably owes a gratitude to the great vast Italian culture, that gives it that galvanizing, vintage appeal. It is a film with everything and a modern classic of extraordinary proportions.9.5 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
josebarajas-11238,"Sep 29, 2022",10/10,"Martin Scorsese's and his understanding of the environment and the value of every character that we see on screen, such a variety of different factors, gimmicks, details, moments that englove the atmosphere of this film, the actors knowledge of their craft, and their knowledge on how to really behave like the characters supposed to behave, the casting in general is great, De Niro, Pesci, Liotta, etcetera, everybody is great and know how to do certain things that makes the environment perfect, and Scorsese's letting their actors to improvise some lines, that really work on everything and every scene, such a great knowledge of the cinematographic art in every aspect, big recommendation on this movie, thank you."

gsfsu,"May 27, 2022",1/10,"When I lived in NYC (in 1970) I knew people as portrayed in this film. They were universally dirtbags with no redeeming qualities at all. To make a movie glorifying them is nothing short of the ultimate pornographic portrayal. And as far as acting.....what does it take to be a fat, cigar chomping illiterate wiseguy who lives on the other side of the law and damages society with every move? It doesn't even rate one star but IMDB has no 'POS' rating."

Much like John Huston's Maltese Falcon is simply directed to perfection. There really isn't a misstep in casting, story soundtrack or pace. The two and a half hours breezes by and the film will stick with you for days. Simply one of the best films ever made without caveats."

This film never gets old for me, the look, pacing, style, everything about this film strikes gold and I could watch it again tomorrow. A great masterclass in filmmaking. Seeing it projected on 35mm film with all of those original imperfections brought something new to this classic for me. It made me feel like it was the first time I was seeing it and I enjoyed it this time the most.I'm a filmmaker in London and love spending time to watch classics, not to try and reinvent the wheel, but to take something beautiful like this movie and incorporate those stunning elements into my creations."

odislene,"Nov 4, 2023",10/10,"You'll see 'Goodfellas' in the every list of the best movies of all time. Along with 'The Godfathers' this movie brings you insights of the tumultuous but interesting mafia world.Acting from De Niro, Liotta and specially Joe Pecci and of course, the direction from Scorssese, makes this movie unforgettable.Loraine Bracco and all women in the movie are fantastic and we have to believe their performance here opened the door for their characters in the 'Sopranos' TV series for some of the actors here.You can watch it several times on different stages of your life and it's not gonna lose the entertainment."
mohanhaworth,"Dec 18, 2025",8/10,"Whilst this film is enjoyable, I think the fact that it is such a classic means that I've pretty much seen it all before. Not that that was a bad thing, because the main thing about this film is that it knows what it wants and executes it perfectly.What really stands out about this film is its latter part, where everything starts falling apart. That, for me, is when everything gets exciting.Ray Liotta delivers a brilliant performance, managing to capture a real sense of paranoia for a man whose life is pretty much collapsing around him.For me though, the real star of the show was Joe Pesci, who adds 100% of the unpredictability to what is otherwise a fairly predictable story (but like I said this is just from the perspective of someone who has never watched this film before and is a fairly modern viewer.) Like bloomin' eck, the man is SCARY, to say the least.Robert De Niro, meh, but giving a solid background performance.One element of this film which I really liked was the whole voiceover thing, which was done really effectively, and didn't make the story boring, instead enhancing it, which is a tricky thing to get right with voiceover.But yeah, a solid film, and I daren't sya otherwise, otherwise Joe Pesci will be after me."
Steffi_P,"Apr 19, 2011",7/10,"The gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with The Godfather pictures in the 1970s. Such classics soon become clichés and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (Prizzi's Honor, Married to the Mob). Goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks.Goodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. And storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. Most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. It's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. But there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. Take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with ""Spider"". These go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. Writers Nicholas Pilleggi and Martin Scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco arguing. This demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. The vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which Quentin Tarantino would soon specialise in.Martin Scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. Like Hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. In effect he's illustrating Henry Hill's words. And often he's showing a little more than that. Sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. There are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. In one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. The camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. We are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. Of course, a lot of Scorsese's technical business here – the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. But so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together.There is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. We don't really get to see the performances at their best. Poor old Ray Liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. The same goes for Lorraine Bracco. Robert De Niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other Italian American gangsters he has played in his career. The only player who really comes out well here is Joe Pesci. Pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. It also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece.Coming from the peak in Scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, Goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. The only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. Old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start."
gonyz,"Jun 28, 2020",10/10,"Everything works perfect in Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi´s 'Wiseguy'.

Kukumeme,"Oct 22, 2021",9/10,"Brilliant dialogue and cinematography in Scorseses Magnum Opus. Goodfellas is a look into the Sicilian Mafia through the eyes of Henry Hill and the blured lines that each member crosses in the persuit of power. The members indulgue in Illegal, unethical and disloyal behavior that at the end of the day is justified as 'just business'. A must watch, Age rating: 16+."
Jerm-2,"Sep 23, 1998",10/10,"Goodfellas is the best Mafia/gangster movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies ever. One of the greatest things about Goodfellas is the very wide range of emotions, moods, expressions, and atmosphere along with the very quick change between them. In a way the ending leaves you with a sort strange feeling, wondering 'should I be happy or sad?' In one way you even want to be a gangster because you see them laughing, happy, having fun and such a good time, but then suddenly it shows them killing or robbing the innocent, and then you don't really want to live like that. Sometimes even a mixture of the two settings to make you feel especially strange. It shows them both so well and at the same time that every person who sees the movie interprets it in a different way. Sometimes the mood they feel depends on the mood before the movie starts. I've heard many different ways people interpreted the movie's expressions and moods, but I always here one thing that's always the same; Goodfellas is one of the greatest movie's of all time."
goodfellas-89549,"Jul 30, 2023",10/10,"As a lifelong movie buff, I have journeyed through tales woven by cinematic geniuses, from Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and David Fincher's ""Fight Club."" Each of these narratives, while grounded in audacious fiction, left indelible marks on my cinematic memory. But none could quite surpass the experience offered by Martin Scorsese's magnum opus, ""Goodfellas."" A testament to the adage that fact can be stranger than fiction, Goodfellas not only mesmerized me but also reshaped my understanding of the power of storytelling.While Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is hailed as the greatest film of all time, for me, ""Goodfellas"" ascends a step further. Beyond just being a film, it's an immersive experience, creating a world so compelling that one doesn't simply watch, but rather, becomes a part of it.""Goodfellas"" is no mere movie. It is a high-octane ride through the treacherous, yet intoxicating underbelly of the mafia. Scorsese adapts Nicholas Pileggi's novel, ""Wiseguy,"" to present a gripping narrative rooted in reality, thus proving that a true story, when well-told, can be as, if not more, captivating than fictional works.The dialogues of the film are a tour de force - memorable, impactful, and infinitely quotable. They're a powerful testament to Scorsese's skillful storytelling, etching themselves into your memory and sparking conversation years after you've left the cinema.The cinematography is nothing short of masterful. Each shot, each angle, each frame serves a purpose, painting a vivid picture of a world not many of us know, but are nevertheless intrigued by. Scorsese takes you on a visual journey that's as captivating as it is unsettling.At the heart of ""Goodfellas"" is Joe Pesci's electrifying performance as Tommy DeVito, for which he earned a well-deserved Oscar. His ten-second acceptance speech at the Academy Awards stands as a symbol of his raw and pure talent - no frills needed. Pesci's portrayal of DeVito is arguably one of the greatest performances in film history, embodying a character so complex and volatile, it's impossible to look away.The pacing of ""Goodfellas"" is a masterclass in filmmaking. There's never a dull moment as Scorsese expertly navigates through decades of organized crime, maintaining the narrative tension throughout. The movie flows like a torrential river, carrying its audience through a whirlwind of emotions.Complementing the visuals and narrative is the incredible soundtrack that pulsates through every scene, enhancing the emotional landscape of the characters. From the adrenaline rush of the criminal high life to the unnerving paranoia induced by overindulgence in drugs, the music adds a layer of authenticity that amplifies the cinematic experience.""Goodfellas,"" in essence, is a cinematic tour de force, a triumph in storytelling that pushes the boundaries of film, and the #1 movie in my list. Its influence stretches far, inspiring masterpieces such as ""The Sopranos."" Yet, it stands tall in its uniqueness, a beacon of filmmaking that reminds us why we fall in love with movies."
shanshan298,"Jan 15, 2016",8/10,"Very difficult and complicated to start thinking about which movie is the best of Martin Scorsese, I think there is no such a film, which always works great films of this soundtrack, just any movie right on the mark, the film is now in my opinion is much less appreciated what else out more movies like that and in my opinion "" Goodfellas ""is presented more as a kind of gangster comedy, a celebration of film that I think about crime drama I can think of"" The Godfather ""and"" City of God ""ranked after"" good guys ""(and rightly so), anyway, Director Scorsese's great with great decor, even cast fantastic and unexpected end, Overrated still too high and is located in IMDb Top 250 and still honor Scorsese with De Niro Liotta Joe outs and all the good guysThere are too many jumps between scenes in my opinion there is no real depth. Long film depicts a lifetime, but as the film shows a Mafia/ at least one crime in his life, I can note that when you do not manufacture and deepening interest in the characters, you just can not make a connection between the character and the viewer. Unfortunately, it happened to me.8/10 in my opinion"
callumkirk81,"Jan 27, 2021",9/10,"The best mobster film from the 90s. It's a true mob story and the actors completely sell it. ""Robert DeNiro"" and ""Joe Pesci"" make it real! It's great from start to the finish. Everything comes together perfectly, the script, acting, soundtrack and pacing all flow seamlessly. ""Martin Scorsese's"" ""Goodfellas"" is a fkn classic. Get it watched!"
Calicodreamin,"Jan 21, 2021",7/10,"Love Ray Liotta in this movie, he is the perfect wiseguy. Cool, handsome, and just a bit deranged. Well developed storyline, especially since it's based on a true story, and great acting. Exactly what I to expect in a gangster movie."
imcarl,"Apr 16, 2005",1/10,"I was bored in study hall, it was a Friday before a long break, so I decided to watch this movie. Have you ever listened to a song compressed to an unreasonable size? This is what this film is. Crushed to a time of around of 72 minutes, this story could really use two. The truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point or conflict. ""Pulp Fiction"", a much better film, pulled off the lack of a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring ""Aviator"". The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators. Characterization dies and a quick and painless death in this pointless script. I'm pretty sure the book writer and writer of the script had a central conflict or point of the film in mind when they wrote it, however, it never comes out in the film. This movie is just bad."
pratyush-03848,"Dec 21, 2015",8/10,"Goodfellas has got to be one of the best mob movies I have seen. Not only that, it is probably the best Scorsese film I have seen so far. The acting, the dialogues, the setting, everything in this film is brilliant. Anyone who watches this film is guaranteed to love it. The plot is based on a true story of a real life mobster Henry Hill. It follows his beginnings as a kid growing up in Brooklyn who eventually works for a crime family. The reason why he wants to work for a crime family, is because ""as far back as he can remember he always wanted to be a gangster."" Henry's life as a mobster forms the rest of the movie. Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta, an actor that I wish to see more on the big screens. His portrayal of the real life gangster is as realistic as it gets. From the mannerisms to the speech delivery, it is almost like we are all thinking this is a real gangster. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Gent, who takes Henry under his wing and in a way mentors him. The other guy Jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with Henry is Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. This to me is the best performance of the film. DeVito is a character with a short fuse and Pesci played the character to perfection. This film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an Oscar for his role. To me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. All in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever. As I said before, everything aspect of the film from start to finish is incredible. This is a film that no one should ever miss, especially if you are one who loves mob movies."
RoBiN_SinGH211221,"Feb 24, 2021",10/10,"One word: priceless
If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.
My Rating:10/10"
AllieRubyStein,"Jun 17, 2020",10/10,"Inventive, with some great performances throughout, and some brilliant directing from Scorsese, Goodfellas serves its right as one of the greatest crime dramas of all time- and at times can be a very fun film to watch. My biggest flaw with the film is the pacing, specifically towards the end, where it seems to be dragging on and overstuffed all at once. I feel in total the film could have been about 10 minutes shorter, but besides its lack in a very satisfying conclusion, the film can be very entertaining. For a film to be nearly 2 and a half hours long, it seems nearly impossible to be as entertaining as it often is. The writing, dialogue, and narration throughout is sharp and very intelligent, and the performances are pure gold- Joe Pesci especially. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco also provide some very good performances, as well as the rest of the supporting and main cast. The cinematography is excellent, with some truly inventive and fun shots to follow, that simply make the film more enjoyable and endlessly watchable. The soundtrack is also great, as well as the atmosphere it provides for the film, and you will be sure to have a joy watching the film and its many parts at the very least some of the time. In the end, Goodfellas has its slower moments, but more often than not, Scorsese has made a brilliant crime film with some great performances, and lines that will be remembered for years to come.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"May 4, 2018",8/10,"While an argument could be made that 'Goodfellas (1990)' perhaps comes dangerously close to glamourising the gangster lifestyle it portrays, this sprawling and relentless picture depicts three-decades of mob life through the eyes of a real-life ex-mafioso who entered into the witness protection program in the early 1980s and ultimately manages to maintain an impartial stance by simply portraying all the events the way they are remembered to have occurred. Our protagonist also never actually kills anyone and his desperate, drug-fuelled downfall is just as detailed as his seduced start. Scorsese directs the piece with a real ferocious verve and the improvised dialogue lends a genuinely unpredictable edge to most sequences, leading to an almost fly-on-the-wall feel even though the techniques used are inherently cinematic. When the violence explodes onto the screen, it is just as shocking as you'd expect it to be. The only downside of all this is that the already long film feels even longer due to the fast-pace and sheer amount of scenes - a minor complaint since it's all so entertaining. 8/10"
matepolcz,"Sep 7, 2025",10/10,"Goodfellas is basically a perfectly written and executed film. Simple as that.The characters are so well-written and even though some of them are bad people, the movie was successful at making me root for them. Everyone is so different from one another and all characters have arcs throughout which are subtle, but visible. Every person here is flawed, but there are ones that you can see are better than others and this is why this film works perfectly. There are a few characters that you like even though they are gangsters. The story is shaped around it's characters and the fact that much of it happened is wild. The dialogues are realistic, fun and they perfectly reflect character.All that wouldn't be this way if not for Martin Scorsese, who directed the hell out of this film. The framing, lighting and camera movement is just perfect and they create tension perfectly, when necessary. The production design is just so fitting. The score adds a lot to the tone and when there's a lack of score, you feel it and the tension rises to great heights. The casting and the acting performances are what make this film iconic. Everyone is perfectly cast, while Ray Liotta, Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci deliver legendary performances.Goodfellas is iconic mainly because of it's perfect writing, directing and acting."

msudude22,"Jun 28, 2018",5/10,Trying to pass Ray Liotta off as a 21 year old was a joke.
asc_chalo,"Nov 24, 2025",9/10,"Goodfellas stands as one of the greatest mob films of all time a masterclass in storytelling, pacing, and character that only Martin Scorsese could deliver. From the electrifying opening line to the unforgettable tracking shots, the film pulls you directly into the intoxicating rise and chaotic fall of life in the mob. The performances are legendary, especially from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro, who bring raw authenticity and energy to every scene.Where the film truly shines is in how effortlessly it balances style and substance. Scorsese's direction is razor-sharp, the soundtrack is iconic, and the voiceover narration adds a personal, gritty layer that sets it apart from any other crime drama. For most of its runtime, it feels flawless gripping, darkly funny, and endlessly rewatchable.However, I wasn't the biggest fan of the ending. While it's faithful to the real story and thematically makes sense, it feels like a tonal shift that doesn't hit as hard as the rest of the film. It's not bad by any means, just not as strong or satisfying as the powerhouse narrative that precedes it."
zzhhhqing,"Apr 10, 2020",9/10,"A gangster documentary like a straight-line documentary, describing the depraved history of a little bastard, but the ending is fairly bright. A long, unmoving long shot that enters the kitchen from the back door and then into the hall is doomed to the birth of a classic."
callanomalley,"Aug 1, 2018",10/10,"Goodfellas is one of those rare films you can watch again and again and still come away feeling you've watched true cinematic mastery at work. The films depiction of the mob is in no way glossy, there's no romantic aspirations of the life of a gangster, it simply puts it as it is. The violence, the cutthroat nature of the lives of these mobsters isn't watered down, if there ever was an anti gang film this may well be it. Ray liotta gives the performance of his career, a height he was never able to hit again and possibly should have earned him an Oscar. De Niro once again proves his craft as the sociopathic Jimmy, teaming up with director Martin Scorcese for a fifth time. Pesci undoubtedly steals the show as the blisteringly violent mobster Tommy De Vito. However the unsung performance of the film falls to Lorraine Bracco as the mob wife a role she play with great energy and brilliant depth, surely Oscar worthy.
If you're looking for the definitive Scorcese film, this may be his best."
Nick_J_S_86,"Apr 7, 2002",4/10,"The best thing about the movie: Joe Pesci was simply amazing.  I thought it was a good movie, but the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied.  I would put it in my top 5 gangster movies, but I don't think it even comes close to ""The Godfather"" or even ""A Bronx Tale"" as far as mafia movies are concerned."
meshai,"Nov 11, 2015",8/10,"I grew up loving the Godfather movies and this one was damn good. The way the story is told through the eyes of one of the characters only helps to draw you into the story. The relationships within the movie were well played and since this movie, I have declared Ray Liotta certifiable. Joe Pesci, who I usually find funny, began to irritate me but Paul Sorvino's Pauly truly made me feel like I could identify with these characters...he was awesome! The rest of the cast really helped to pull this amazing movie together. Then to find out it was actually based on a true story, WOW! There is no way that you can watch Goodfellas and tell me you didn't enjoy it! I did and I am super finicky with what I watch....I not only give this movie 2 enthusiastic thumbs up but I encourage you to re-watch it if its been a while!"
aghawks,"Jan 14, 2021",10/10,"'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie (2nd to ""The Departed"") it is incredible. The film is stunning in every single way. The consistently fine acting by the large cast, the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is amazing, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles. A 10/10 must watch movie !!"
MrChair007,"Dec 13, 2024",8/10,"This is a really good movie. Sometimes my reviews may be a tad negative or harsh. This will have none of that.Pretty much every aspect is excellent. And you can watch this 1000 times and enjoy it every time. This is one of my classic ""see it's halfway through on TV and sit down and watch it till the end"" movies. It's great. Acting is fantastic. Joe Pesci has one of the best supporting roles of all-time. The story is perfect. Every thing is just great.Best part of the movie? The scene where they cut the garlic with a razor blade. Have I tried that since watching? Nah. But every time I cut garlic I think about it. Now that's an impactful movie."
TheUnknown837-1,"Apr 5, 2009",10/10,"When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" as the best next to ""Fargo"" (1996) but also labeled it ""the best mob movie ever."" A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, ""Goodfellas"" is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to ""The Godfather"" (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace ""The Godfather"" (1972) as the best mafia movie, ""Goodfellas"" would be it.""Goodfellas"" is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.Unlike other mob movies, ""Goodfellas"" does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves. The movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the Ray Liotta character immediately states afterward: ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United Statesit was there that I knew that I belonged.""This is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and Martin Scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. In regards to the cast, it is perfect. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. The only part I thought was wrongly developed was Lorraine Bracco's character. I just felt the character was either too over the top or Bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. There is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which I felt was just a little too long. But these few minor flaws aside, ""Goodfellas"" is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where Hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range."

nicolewasheretoo,"Dec 31, 2023",8/10,"I am not much of a fan of maffia films but I see the great quality of this film. The acting, the direction, the camera work, the sets and costumes are all top notch. This film kept me interested and engaged throughout, if a bit baffled at the depressingly violent lives that the characters chose to live.We follow the life of a gangster with a voiceover (unnecessary in my view) telling us how young Henry is attracted to the glamour and power of the gangster lifestyle from childhood. It appears to be his only way out of a boring working class life.Henry makes his way up the ranks, although he realises that as a non-Italian he will never reach the top. Other than the money and the power it is difficult to understand what it is Henry enjoys about his maffia life. The mobsters live in a claustrophobic, paranoid world, where supposed friends can turn on each other at any moment. Most of the mobsters are obnoxious, violent psychopaths as well as complete morons. They blow their blood money on tacky homes, cars and clothes, greedy wives and sleazy girlfriends.Henry's wife gets a voice in this movie too, which is interesting. She willingly chooses this mobster to start a family with, despite the danger, the stress and the trauma it causes to her children (which we see crying a lot).All in all, all of the main characters come across as highly unsympathetic and I found it difficult to understand what kept them in the horror lives they were living. But then again, once you've entered the world of crime, it is probably very difficult to get out.So, perhaps it was a morality tale: stay away from the world of crime and drugs are bad, m'kay."
musonyeligare,"Sep 4, 2022",7/10,"Gangster movies are really about power. We watch movies of this genre because they inspire us to take control. We want to take and express power to those around us effortlessly. Otherwise, what's the point of watching films in this genre?For a film with talented actors such as this, it can be difficult to really see how the characters will play their roles and convince viewers who's really in charge. I like how the cast display their power. However, Paul Cicero takes the crown.Who's really powerful in the clique? I watched this film just for that. I like the scene where Paul Sorvino (Paul Cicero's character) controls the crew without uttering a single word. He gets in the room and everyone in the clique keeps quiet. Now, that's power right there."
claszdsburrogato,"Oct 22, 2023",10/10,"There are countless mafia films that are well remembered and loved by the public. Many are even considered part of the best films in history. Goodfellas is one of those great titles. The way the story begins already leaves the viewer completely caught up in the plot. The story is very engaging and the pacing is sensational. The film is long and at many points it is not even possible to notice the time passing. The actors are fantastic, there is no average performance throughout the film. Perhaps the only lower moment in the film is in the final hour, where a certain moment seems more dragged out than the rest. In short, Martin Scorsese's direction is perfect, all the scenes are beautiful and this is certainly one of the best mafia films in history, going head to head with The Godfather."
j-665,"Feb 15, 2007",10/10,"In my mind this is the second best movie ever made after One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2 are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather's can be much too serious at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers's no room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and performances....i guess i'll call that one a draw. If you like this one check out Casino. It's not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather's but still very deserving of a viewing. Other mob recomendations are Miller,s Crossing, the Untouchables, Once Upon a Time in America, Scar Face and the Godfather Part 3, yes i just said that."
mfkvk,"Jul 31, 2021",10/10,"If you're part of a crew, nobody ever tells you that they're going to kill you, doesn't happen that way. There weren't any arguments or curses like in the movies. See, your murders come with smiles, they come as your friends, the people who've cared for you all of your life. And they always seem to come at a time that you're at your weakest and most in need of their help."
alibabs123,"Jan 15, 2026",8/10,"While crime movies, gangster films and mobster flicks very much existed before and certainly since Goodfellas, this very much still feels like the benchmark of the genre. Goodfellas is a gripping and stylish dive into the rise and fall of life in the mafia, anchored by Martin Scorsese's sharp direction. The film excels in its energy, memorable performances, and iconic soundtrack that perfectly captures the era. Ray Liotta delivers a compelling lead but gets dwarfed by DeNiro, while Joe Pesci's explosive portrayal steals nearly every scene. He blends charm with terrifying unpredictability and humour.... but he's no clown, he's not here to amuse you...
The pacing is fast and immersive, it's clever use of long continuous takes pull you into the thrill of power, loyalty, and excess before exposing its dark consequences. While the violence is intense, it serves the story rather than overwhelming it. Overall, Goodfellas remains a highly entertaining, influential crime classic that balances excitement with a sobering look at ambition and downfall."
jackman-74739,"Apr 27, 2020",8/10,"A Scorsese classic. It ticks all the boxes. Italians, gangsters, lots of fbombs, the lot. It's very well directed and the style changes throughout the film which compliments the narrative, e.g. romanticised and flowing at the beginning to jerky and unrhythmic at the end. The acting was also fantastic with everyone pretty much becoming a stereotype, especially joe Pesci. The script was tight as well, with a great twist at the ending. however I felt like his downfall cane a little too quickly and it ended quite abruptly. Other than that it made gangster life seem kinda appealing...
Other than all the killing stuff"
elliotswincher,"Apr 17, 2023",8/10,"The acting by the main three -- Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci -- is brought forward with such realism that it allows you to truly see how ruthless and evil the mafia is.Much like in The Godfather, we get to see a retrospective that shows why people become involved in the Mafia and also the focus is much more on the killings and tense interactions between members if they let down the boss rather than showing their lives and making you feel sorry for them. That aspect is showed a little but not as much as other mafia films.I also want to send high praise to Martin Scorsese for his phenomenal directing once again as in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Shutter Island.The music is timed at the exact right moment to allow for the film to seem as if it has been made in one continuous shot and therefore editing looks flawless and seamless."

IdiotBox_Recommendations,"Jul 23, 2020",9/10,"Goodfellas is a movie which will provide you with a cinematic experience worth a lifetime. Based on Nichola Pleggi's book 'wise guy', this masterpiece directed by the phenomenal Martin Scorsese, narrates the true story of an Irish-Italian mobster- Henry Hill spanning over a period of 30 years.Coming from a working class background in Brooklyn, Henry who always wanted to be a mobster was taken under the wings by a local gangster 'Paulie' at the age of 11. Initially running small errands, Henry gradually went up the ladder to become one of the closest associates to Paulie.
The fascinating mob culture and its ghastly, gut wrenching business hiding behind the glamourous life of new York city mafia from the 50s to the 80s is exposed through Henry's eyes.Henry and his associates had pulled up one of the largest heists in American history- The Lufthansa theft after which a number of mobsters where brutally killed by them out of paranoia.
However greed, deceit, drugs and certain catastrophic choices eventually lead to the downfall of this mafia in 1980.This movie has a stellar cast and mind-blowing performances by the legendary actor Robert De Niro as James Burke or Jimmy- the master mind behind the heist, Joe Pesci who won an Oscar for his role as the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Ray Liotta as Henry and Lorraine Bracco.Probably one of Martin Scorsese's finest mobster movie this classic is a must watch."
