Bonobo13579,"Jul 21, 2023",7/10,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil."
mark-217-307033,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."
MrDHWong,"Jul 20, 2023",10/10,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."
PDean09,"Jul 21, 2023",8/10,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."
mohameddawoud-26019,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
and_mikkelsen,"Jul 20, 2023",10/10,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!"
Dvir971,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I have watched in a long, long time.Very different from Nolan's recent films, especially the sci-fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the biopic/drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he has tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.One can think of Oppenheimer as a great example of catching lightning in a bottle. After a career full of brilliant works and paradigm-shifting films, Sir Nolan managed to craft a film that, in my opinion, is perfect. Against all odds, the film attracted an unparalleled audience size for its genre and proved to studios and public opinion that true cinema will always prevail.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.The script of Nolan's Oppenheimer is based prominently on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Anyone familiar with the book can attest that Nolan's adaptation, transforming a lengthy, detail-laden book filled with transcripts and theoretical physics into a blockbuster that captivated a wide audience, is nothing short of miraculous. While the film's directing is undoubtedly masterful and even considered the film's strongest aspect by critics and award bodies worldwide, in my personal opinion, the writing is the most powerful element of the film-even without taking into account the complex material it is based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3 hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.A huge standout element of the film is the superb soundtrack by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who won an Oscar, Grammy, and numerous other awards for his work on this film. According to Nolan himself, the film is divided into three acts: the first resembling a hero origin story, the second like a heist film, and the third like a courtroom drama. It's impressive how the soundtrack mirrors these acts perfectly, each suited to the genre portrayed on screen while maintaining consistency in the melodies and musical themes presented throughout the film. Using about 40 string players, 15 wind instruments, one harp, and a synthesizer, Göransson managed to meet both his and Nolan's high expectations, creating one of the most breathtaking soundtrack albums in recent years. The cinematography is stunning, and the editing is cutting-edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Sir Nolan is well known for his profound love and respect for science, as well as his understanding of its importance in both storytelling and real-world impact. This is reflected in the themes he chooses to explore, the logical framework behind his scripts, and the technical aspects of his filmmaking process. From project to project, he tries to tell captivating stories that highlight the vital role of scientists and the value of intellect in the modern era. Oppenheimer is no exception, but in this project, Nolan aimed to explore not only the importance and positive influence of scientific innovations, but also the consequences they have on all of us and how they might achieve not only what was initially intended.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Among Sir Christopher Nolan's strengths is that he for sure knows how to do a proper ending sequence. He is rather well known for that. However, with Oppenheimer, he took this skill to a whole new level. A gut-wrenching, emotionally devastating ending that knocks the wind out of the viewer and leaves him speechless, contemplating everything he just witnessed and the implications it has for our world, ever relevant in these uncertain times. With Göransson's unforgettable music and Murphy's brilliant acting, this scene serves as one of my personal favorite ending scenes in a movie ever.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in their seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film- and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only halfway through, but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, writing, directing, acting, score- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. I watched it once already and am going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."
shivamkanodia-94992,"Jul 19, 2023",9/10,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema."
bissatadam,"Jul 19, 2023",8/10,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade."
Zayfi,"Jul 20, 2023",9/10,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."
leestoych,"Jul 22, 2023",8/10,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."
jjqqhnqhg,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue."
andy_c_les,"Aug 3, 2023",6/10,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss."
wxqyaxr,"Jul 23, 2023",5/10,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped."
maison-van-cleers,"Jul 27, 2023",N/A,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype."
show24studio,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'killers of the flower moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."
adrianwbowman,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"
zeki-4,"Jul 20, 2023",8/10,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so."
marcelbenoitdeux,"Dec 27, 2023",10/10,"I was immediately taken by Cillian Murphy's entrance as Oppenheimer and then the seriousness of the proceedings. Christopher Nolan has already proven he is a director for the ages. Actors bend over backwards to work with him even in small, one scene parts. Here Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck and Remi Malek for instance. But is Cillian Murphy who envelopes the entire journey with the kind of truth that makes the whole thing utterly compelling. I've loved Cillian Murphy since his miraculous ""Breakfast On Pluto"" Here he is is extraordinary. Extraordinary! Visually, the film is a marvel without ever falling into an effects-fest. Superb."
avinthyasovis,"Sep 14, 2024",8/10,"I'm amazed how great storytelling this was. This inhuman thing to do, making a bomb that maker doesn't even know the limits of destruction, director showed this in a human way. This was a simple story. But curiosities were maintained well with flashbacks and sudden reminders. I think the director's intention to show us how Oppenheimer saw this discovery was successful. Oppenheimer was proud of it and first then he regrets as soon as he found out how bombs were used. Cillan did very beautiful job playing this smart yet troubled personal life man. Robert Downey and Florence Pugh were best as supporting actors. Their involvement with main character added so much emotion to this film. Music in this movie is another appreciated thing. I know people who don't like classical music might call it boring but to me this was a true gem. Soundtrack kept us hoooked in to the flow of story."
ryan-beauchesne,"Aug 13, 2023",6/10,"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic.And really, 75% of this movie is a small backroom kangaroo court prosecution that is just flatly boring and soo unnecessarily long.As another reviewer said, you could just listen to the audio of this movie and it would be virtually the same experience. There is nothing visually interesting or exciting."
JordanSatmary,"Aug 4, 2023",4/10,"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained."
dweston-38669,"Jul 25, 2023",N/A,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad."
VorpalJay,"Oct 7, 2024",8/10,"It took me three nights to get through this film. Yes I know it won awards, but I found myself getting distracted. Maybe it's because the material is so difficult and the man himself is not that likable that I found myself disengaging. So you can see this is not really critique of the film itself but my reaction to it which is a course with all critiques are. This one is perhaps not as pundit worthy, but I'm gonna power through it so I can just remember that I watched this and take it off my watchlist although probably I should watch it again. So, there you have it, folks. Well done, but not captivating."
headbangin_mammoth,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me."
tmamad,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.Particle for direct object
CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.Nolan's amazing love You so much ."
slightlymad22,"Jul 21, 2023",8/10,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love."
Hajdudavid-692-274435,"Jul 23, 2023",6/10,"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon."
Steveco52,"Aug 26, 2023",5/10,"Yeah, I got lost a few times in this movie by the continual switching time periods. And had a difficult time understanding some of the dialogue because of the loud soundtrack. I felt it was an hour too long! Excellent acting kept me interested. Robert Downy Jr. Was amazing! The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on. But this movie I won't do that."
planktonrules,"Apr 19, 2025",8/10,"By any standard, ""Oppenheimer"" was a wildly successful film. After all, it was a huge box office draw AND earned several Oscars...including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. So, I am not saying it's a bad film...it isn't. But it's also a film I didn't love.The film is about the career of J. Robert Oppenheimer from his days before WWII to his losing his security clearance and fading into relative obscurity. To tell this story, it bounced back and forth in time and uses very rapid edits and tense music...to the point where I found myself respecting the movie but also not enjoying it very much. To me, I think it is very good...just not quite as good as all the hype would imply. Well worth watching...but I probably would have preferred a different style...such as a more linear film. But of course, with all the money and prestige the film has...who am I to complain about these small details?"
aissammadmoun,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy.

Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.Can't wait to see Barbie next."
rayanenaffati,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman."
h-i-hussain7,"Jul 22, 2023",8/10,"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.8.5/10Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!"

Miruna_,"Oct 4, 2024",8/10,"Oppenheimer, the movie that dominated the 2024 Oscars. Is it worth your time?Well, maybe a little bit overrated but it's beautifully filmed and directed. The actors did an incredible job, especially RDJ and Murphy. I love the fact that Lewis Strauss' point of view was filmed black and white. However, the cheery on top for me was the ending; I could say that it was worth waiting for it.On the other hand, it was way too long and the first half of the movie was slow, boring and didn't add that much to the whole story; I almost thought of giving up the movie. I feel like it could've been better as a two, maybe two and a half hours long movie. Another aspect that I did not like was the relationship between Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock and the fact that it doesn't respect the truth. They put Oppenheimer in a bad lighting when, in reality, the timing of the relationship was different.Overall, it's a good movie and it's worth watching (if you have three hours at your disposal)."
jsdana09,"Jul 23, 2023",6/10,"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection."
FiftyTwo_52,"Dec 12, 2025",8/10,"This is everything I'd heard and then some... a modern classic at 8.5/10.I was hesitant about a slow three-hour movie, but there's not a single filler moment. Nolan makes every minute engaging, building relentless tension even in dialogue-heavy scenes.The cast is a genuine who's who, and everyone delivers, but this belongs to Cillian Murphy. His Oppenheimer is haunted, brilliant, tragic - a performance for the ages. Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon provide equally notable support, with Downey especially revelatory in a career-best turn.Visually stunning, intellectually rigorous, morally complex... Nolan trusts his audience completely. The Trinity test is spectacular, but the film's real power lies in its exploration of genius, responsibility, and consequences. The runtime flies by; the themes linger long after.This is filmmaking at the highest level: ambitious, accessible, artistically uncompromising. A biographical drama that achieves genuine epic scope while remaining intensely human. Essential viewing."
GoatOfNeptune,"Jul 22, 2023",6/10,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."
jhalcollege,"Aug 14, 2023",3/10,"And the only entertaining part is two hours in when someone ""passes gas.""But seriously, this moving is non-stop science/political jargon without ever pausing to give you a chance to process what you heard. The characters are unrelatable and undeveloped. There is no exposition, no rising action, no climax, and no resolution. It's just monotonous talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk-talk *new scene* talk-talk=talk some more.Gone is the magic of The Prestige, the depth Inception, and the wonder of Interstellar. In its place is pretentions telling, not showing.PS: Why does Florence Pugh not wear clothes at any point during this movie?"
ANGRYSPNGGAMER55,"Aug 31, 2024",8/10,"Now biography movies is something I will almost never sit down and watch. I did it with The Killers Of The Flower Moon (which is a movie I highly recommend you watch if you liked Oppenheimer) and I loved it even though the movie is too long and it may exhaust some viewers. Oppenheimer touches a topic I am such a fan of but what I said about all movies that talk about real eras, I did not sit down to watch a historical lecture, I sat down to watch a movie...And as a movie, judging every element a movie should have to be great, It is spectacular. The cast and therefore the acting is amazing, the cinematography is perfect (You should expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan) and the movie is formed and coated in a way that even though it is long it tries to keep the viewer's attention on the movie as much as possible, adding suspense and some jawdropping scenes (like the scene where the first bomb is dropped). They say that if you don't like a movie or a video game genre you should not watch/play it let alone judge it harshly if you don't like it and I couldn't agree more to that. However , even though I really liked Oppenheimer I can't but rate it an 8 because as I said I am not a fan of this type of movies. That doesn't mean anything at all though. If you like biography and drama movies this will most likely be a perfect movie for you. Recommended."
tm-sheehan,"Jul 20, 2023",10/10,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."
zaidobe,"Jul 20, 2023",10/10,"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish."
maukaroni,"Jul 26, 2023",10/10,"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work."
nirodhasilva,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema."
perfectincision,"Jul 21, 2023",6/10,"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history."
richardhayes-47287,"Aug 25, 2023",10/10,"I feel somewhat underwhelmed a day after seeing this movie. It's hyped, and I felt myself wanting to enjoy it more. I felt almost as I should enjoy it more, but I found it long, hard work and at times, tough to follow.This has an ensemble cast, and whilst it's my humble opinion, almost all are wasted. Although 3 hours long, we never get the chance to try and identify with the characters. There's not enough character development and nor do we see anything of worth about how Oppenheimer is 'the way he is'. Emily Blunt portrayed as a functioning alcoholic annoyed me, as this just wasn't the case.I wanted to see what this bomb did to the world, and understand more about it. We're given nothing about how we split the atom, refine uranium and the like. Absolutely nothing, other than a news excerpt stating that 'we've split the atom', and the next step is an awaiting Trinity test. This annoyed me again.The Trinity test, a site that I've actually visited, has to be the most anticlimactic on screen explosion I've ever seen. I get that Nolan opted to be CGI free, but you can't fake a nuclear explosion for film with ten barrels of petrol and try and be cute with the sound for likes. It was poor.However, this is a decent watch overall, but that's all. I'll not see it again until I see it drop onto Netflix.You'll either love it or hate it I guess."
Hughmanity,"Mar 18, 2024",6/10,"The Christopher Nolan obsession with time jumping hits maximum overdrive in Oppenheimer. It's a blizzard of back and forth, color to black and white (even though black and white is in the future from color which adds even more confusion), with only the added gray of a person's hair to give us any indication of when we are at, and no years ever given for reference at any point in the movie.This could have been an intriguing story of Oppenheimer and how factors of his youth influenced his thinking and led him to the success he had in leading the development of the atomic bomb and how that ended the war against Japan. Instead there is little backdrop or insight into what was driving him, short shrift on the development and war, and the focus is mainly on the painful McCarthyism investigation and the petty double dealings of this movie's primary antagonist, Strauss.I watched this movie at home and it took me several days to get through it because of how painfully pedantic it was. The dialogue drones on and on trying to make something dramatic out of a security clearance hearing. I just couldn't get into it. I still gave it a 6 because there are some magnificent acting performances by Murphy, Downey and Blunt but they're the only thing holding this mess together."
kppk-04802,"Jul 24, 2023",5/10,"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end."
Osmiumos,"Mar 7, 2024",N/A,"Nolan made the telling of the story as complicated as he possibly could... as is his way. Made it a story of McCarthy inquisition and told the story of the Manhattan project via a sequence of flashbacks to overdramatised moments with actors expressing pithy cliches. Turned the story of the biggest applied R&D project in history and development of applied atomic science into an individual cult of personality and a bureaucratic conspiracy. Not the story I tuned in for, and i struggle to believe this found any sort of broad audience. Nice suits, great lighting, overbearing music, a very long and tediously, implausibly dramatised telling of a significant history."

James_Farr,"Nov 19, 2023",8/10,"As a general overview the movie has great pacing. While somewhat on the longer side the rising and falling tension along with the back and forth from case to events allows the viewer to feel constantly involved. Acting is well done on many parts and the sound effects and score genuinely enhance the feel of each scene brining the viewer to the edge of their seat and back. As a small negative side, I personally would have liked to see more visuals incorporated with explanations and development of the phsyics / science used through out the film.

Sleepin_Dragon,"Aug 6, 2023",9/10,"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10."

schlomo-jones,"Jul 21, 2023",6/10,"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history."
ishraqrasif,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species."
andrenollba,"Sep 2, 2023",6/10,"The film failed to deliver on the hype. It is certainly Oscar-material, well produced and with great actors, but that doesn' t mean it was entertaining. The three hours were a bit too long, and, by the way,, what's so wrong with the traditional 2h-format, not many films deserve longer than that, and Oppenheimer is not one of them.. In my opinion too much footage was wasted on the congressional hearing and on the 'trial', which may be intresting for an American audience, but not so much for international viewers. The ethical dilemnas on building the bomb were justed hinted at, and that would have a more universal appeal."
mydummybox,"Aug 25, 2023",5/10,"I registered out of disappointment after seeing this film and disbelief at so many enthusiastic reviews.It is not a terrible film, mind me, but definitely below Nolan's (inter)stellar standards.From the emphatic acting, to the bombastic soundtrack, to the (ab)use of trivial special effects: to me everything seemed over the top, blatant, exaggerated and overloaded, pretentious and decidedly lacking the finesse Nolan has accustomed us to. In that, it reminded me of Spielberg's indigestible The Fabelmans.Another huge problem is that the characters came across as stereotypical, particularly the members of the committee. The way Oppenheimer's supposed moral dilemma is portrayed is very naive, and the protagonist's facial expressions can only do so much to convey the inner struggle.Like most of Nolan's films, this one is also very long, which becomes a problem when the story development lacks the compelling inspiration of Interstellar, Inception, and especially The Dark Knight. The film drags on for 3 hours in a very predictable and boring way, so much that some viewers showed signs of relief when the film finally ended. I was among them.Overall unremarkable, if not a major disappointment."
LauraAnnG,"Feb 17, 2024",N/A,"I sometimes struggle with movies that jump around in the space/time continuum. And that happened here. It takes effort to figure out what is going on. It becomes exhausting dealing with the timeline jumps.I do like Nolan's films and was ready to like this a lot.I'm sure most of you have seen this movie already...
The actor who plays Oppenheimer is very strange looking and that also took some of my attention. I am the last to judge but he's just very weird with eyes and a face that always looks surprised.Anyway, I wasn't enjoying it all that much until it got near the ending when Rami Malek shows up and the point of it suddenly clicked into place.It's not so much a science history movie as a political drama. Duh.Because it is theoretically about history and a very interesting time and event, I should have just loved this movie, and I don't know what it was that made it such a chore to watch other than it told much of its story via what happens in two hearings (one public, one private). Perhaps I am getting old and grumpy.As it got to the end and the ""clicking into place"" happened, I thought I should watch it again.. but at 3 hours? I doubt that I will. It is a long movie, to be sure, but weirdly the development of the bomb seems pretty fast. There's a disconnect there.It is worth mentioning Robert Downy Jr at this point. He's wonderful as the ""heavy"". I miss him in the MCU movies. In fact, I miss those glory days of MCU movies... Thor and Ironman and all the rest.You don't know what you have until it's gone."
gnperuti,"Sep 18, 2024",10/10,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough."
sonshineboy,"Aug 2, 2023",8/10,"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.But alas I give it an 8!"
ferguson-6,"Jul 22, 2023",9/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023."
TheAnirudhRoy,"Jul 23, 2023",9/10,"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more."
JPARM-IMDb,"Jul 25, 2023",7/10,"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming."
andysaleen-05305,"Jul 21, 2023",7/10,"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched."
tomzek,"Jul 22, 2023",5/10,"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again."
MTNmovieMan,"Mar 22, 2024",N/A,"Felt like I watched three hours of previews for what should've been a great film. The bouncing timeline was confusing and did nothing for the story.I expected to see something, anything, about the devastation these bombs caused to innocent families, woman, and children. The low budget movie; Einstein and the bomb, was much more informative and entertaining.Casting Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was an insult to even novices of history. Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon delivered uninspiring performances that felt more like cameos offered up for friends of the producers.The exhausting, strewn out Nuremberg trial scenes seemed like an after thought and reeked of ""dramatic interpretation"".The attention this film got followed by the praise given by nervous critics afraid of offending the Hollywood elite was a perfect example of the ""King has no clothes."" Take a pass and watch Barbie, it, at least, won't take two nights to finish 🤷‍♂️"
gdabungke,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film."
sydmiller12,"Dec 8, 2023",10/10,"Like the headline says this film had a lot of heart and it treats each character with care and Nolan writes them very well. I haven't been able to connect this much to a Nolan character since Interstellar.Another thing I have to praise is the cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema is amazing as per usual he always delivers and this is no different.Nolan's direction is very thought out in terms of blocking and where he decides to place the character. And I think his direction goes very hand in hand with the writing. Also, another thing that goes hand in hand with the writing is the editing from Jennifer Lame who is an amazing editor, and I think this is some of her best work.Every performance is amazing. And every actor delivers something interesting to each character. Some stand out performances are obviously Cillian Murphy & Florence Pugh. I never was really interested a Cillian fan but this definitely changed my mind, and I knew Florence was an amazing actress since I saw Midsommar, I would definitely check her out in A Good Person which was amazing as well.Overall great film!"
omartroy-81571,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.Thank you guys for this Masterpiece."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Jul 31, 2023",8/10,"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?"
jonnymoviesbr,"Jan 4, 2025",9/10,"Oppenheimer delves into the life of one of the most complex people of the past century, with an audacious and compelling narrative style, and striking imagery. This is an unforgettable cinematic experience, the music, the sound design, the performances(specially Murphy and Downey Jr), and Nolan's masterful direction. Too long? Probably, however the story is very immersive. A bit pretentious? Sure, that's an understatement, since we're talking about a Nolan movie. It's not perfect, but it's very above average in today's standards. A successful movie about the making of the atomic bomb, about 40% being a court room drama?! Come on, that's a miracle, that somehow the gods of cinema pulled off. Years and years of generic, CGI heavy crap being dumped in theaters and finally a movie with actual cinematic quality shines through!"
amirnz,"Jul 24, 2023",7/10,"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.The good:Fantastic scoreGood acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey JrExcellent cinematographyThe bad:
-Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostractingMovie tries to pack too much into theee hour runtime and doesn't get it's priorities right. It feels like a series of ""This happened and then that happened"" scenes and a collage of everything in his life. Several prominent characters get introduced in rapid succession and they are gone before you get to know them or to care in the slightest. On the other hand the movie dedicates too much time to things like the courtroom drama and sex scenesUnnecessary sex and nudity, with all the feminist movement these days and considering we're in 2023, we surely should not put sex acenes and nudity only for the sake of it but only if they add to the plot. Unfortunately in Openheimer's case they don't. We see absolute unnecessary sex and nudity in this film that serve no purpose.One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall."
badscene,"Feb 27, 2025",7/10,"Well made but possibly the most overrated film in modern history.The performances vary from at worst, weak-- to at best, inconsistent- the casting was uninspired (cough Matt Damon) The bomb scene was a tease. And the film manages to somehow be simultaneously under-edited and over-edited. It would have seriously benefitted from a good 45-60 mins cut from its runtime.Oppenheimer feels like the kind of movie only a Hollywood cash-cow auteur surrounded by Yes men could make.More focus on the bomb, its victims, and the science behind it would have made for a more interesting film. This is 3 hours of (mostly) Mccarthyist witch hunt politics and name actors attempting to elevate completely average performances with transformation make-up and prosthetics."
jkbovill,"Aug 21, 2023",3/10,"Consider yourself warned
Very boring and waaaay too long. I didn't care about any of the characters or the petty hostilities between them.No need for IMAX--or the big screen for that matter--because there were no compelling visuals.Nolan's non-linear storytelling was confusing and unnecessary.Overly dramatic, very loud score during ceaseless committees about security clearance and communism.Didn't really see the point of the out of place nudity or sex scenes.Matt Damon's character was the lone bright spot.I was totally underwhelmed and can't understand the buzz.Surprisingly BORING."
sforl-14909,"Sep 28, 2024",10/10,"Befitting the Manhattan project timeline this film has many moving parts all at nearly the speed of sound. But don't despair, the stories are solid and held together through Oppenheimer's persistence and peculiarities.The genesis of the project began years earlier in Germany and the Quantum Physics heavyweights go toe to toe with egos and smarts.I am going to watch this again and again because it is detailed to the nth degree but those details are pixels framing the bigger picture: the struggles of one man contemporaneously brilliant and reckless: astute and naive, loving and aloof. Oppenheimers job was much more difficult than the 2nd most difficult job on the planet: that job was held by Eisenhower who smoked five packs of cigarettes and drank 20 cups of coffee per day to get through it. It nearly killed Ike and Oppenheimer.Wonderfully cast and superbly filmed, this longer film is a reward for those who enjoy all aspects of filmmaking.Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Give the best dramatic performances I've seen in decades. Mind blowing performances."
maherrazi,"Jul 20, 2023",8/10,"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life."
AlsExGal,"Nov 26, 2023",10/10,"... and it's not like I didn't know how it ended.This was a great accomplishment by Nolan, a tremendous visual spectacle that was also very dialogue intensive. That would lead to my only criticism, which was that the IMAX cameras, which lack soundproofing but of which Nolan is quite the fan, cause the dialogue to be obscured. I had to start over about ten minutes in and turn on the subtitles on the blu ray. I don't know what I would have done if I had tried to watch it in a theater, but I digress.Cillian Murphy does an outstanding job as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. I watched a ""making of"" documentary that came with the film, and Murphy said that the vast majority of the footage of Oppenheimer that exists consists of Oppenheimer giving lectures or speeches rather than just casually talking, so that it made it hard to get a feel for the man. He uses that in his performance as you see the portrait of someone who feels and thinks deeply but keeps his cards close to his vest in most cases. He really is an enigma.The film does go back and forth in time like so many Nolan films, but I did not find it confusing like I have found to be the case in some of his other works. Maybe that is because I already knew quite a bit about Oppenheimer's life, so I'd have to say YMMV.I'd say that the real tragedy of Oppenheimer's life was becoming somewhat of a political figure while not really having political instincts himself. Because in politics, they need you until they don't, and Oppenheimer wasn't really needed after he delivered the bomb, and so he was buffeted about by the changing times and one of the most paranoid episodes in American history, the age of HUAC and the red scares of the 1950s.I'd highly recommend this film as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. There are so many fine supporting performances including Matt Damon as the gruff Major (and later General) Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. As the paranoid Lewis Strauss. The film may be three hours long but the time just flew by."
satoreviews,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,"This is my first review ever and as a big Nolan fan I have never come to write any on some of his other phenominal films but I have finally decided to write a short review to highlight Oppenheimers work of art.To start with, Cillian Murphy is just excellent and is everything I hoped for - he truly embodied J. Robert Oppenheimer. R. D. J. After many years in the Marvel universe has returned with a bang! Matt Damon was also great and I particularly enjoyed Murphy's and Damon's character dynamics and dialogues together.The dense screenplay is oscar worthy. The film however is quite dialogue heavy but is made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and the well-written script.Lastly, I have always believed that music is what moves us emotionally during a film. Ludwig Göransson has yet again created an absolutely thrilling and suspenseful score thats flows extremely well with the films pace and aura. These are my personal favourites - give them a listen if you haven't already!: ""Can You Hear The Music"", ""Meeting Kitty"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""American Prometheus"", ""Trinity"", ""Something More Important"", ""Destroyer of Worlds"", ""Oppenheimer"".And yes... Of course I am writing this review whilst listening to the soundtrack."
amwilburn-60131,"Nov 30, 2023",9/10,"Oppenheimer (2023)
Yes, to paraphrase another review, this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.9.2/10, A-"
dryfk,"Jul 28, 2023",6/10,"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy."
lone_samurai678,"Jul 21, 2023",7/10,"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10."
aharmas,"Jul 22, 2023",4/10,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold."
swapnadipchandra,"Jul 22, 2023",N/A,"Patience growing thin! Dunkirk-Ok, Tenet-Really, Oppie-Oh Come on!.Fan of Nolan but seriously as a Non-American, it does not concern me. Where is the 'entertainment' element here??I am not bothered with what US of A did with their brilliance as it has never reflected herself to be a just country.All the actors did an outstanding job but after 3 hours if Russel Crowe asked me then no, I am not entertained!Don't care if its art or biopic or whatever.Also, the back and forth timeline is not appealing anymore.....its time to let time flow as usual now!I think Nolan takes a back seat for now while Guy Ritchie goes ahead!"
gautamraj361,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative."
donny12345,"Nov 26, 2023",9/10,"In my opinion, films exist not only to educate people and to teach and remember history so that we don't make the same mistakes again and again. In my opinion, films exist to entertain people and give them a unique experience.This film was an emotional roller coaster, and I have rarely experienced such truly outstanding moments.Visually, sound-wise and historically, Oppenheimer is a milestone in cinema history and had me pressed into my seat from start to finish, even my watch often informed me that my pulse was beating at over 140BPM, So pay attention to your breathing because this film will literally take your breath away in one scene or another."
roxlerookie,"Nov 21, 2023",9/10,"I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil. Not your casual romcom, but a rewarding watch if your brain is up for it."
matt-27634,"Jul 22, 2023",6/10,"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest."
EdwardtheBlackPrince,"Jul 21, 2023",8/10,"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home."
ahamedfahimq,"Jul 22, 2023",6/10,"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck."
axelvaldo,"Sep 13, 2023",5/10,"I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better."
id247,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,"Saw Oppenheimer today on an IMAX screen. I'm an emotional wreck but also buzzing with delight! Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!"
thetman-85851,"Jul 25, 2024",8/10,"Wow. This movie literally changed my life. I know that might sound like I'm glazing it to the extreme but it really did. Before watching this movie i was not very fond of American history let alone any history at all. I never really cared about who invented the light bulb, the toaster, the microwave, and i definitely never thought id care about who invented the atomic bomb. However, this movie sparked a passion in me that i didn't even know existed. I found myself on google the moment after any character was named researching on who they were. What role did they play in history? How did they affect the creative process of the atomic bomb? Who is Edward teller? This movie left me on edge and curious throughout the entire time. Eager to learn. I even found myself researching the science. I have never been so drawn into a non fiction movie in my entire life. J. Robert Oppenheimer was quite the interesting person and this movie tells his story flawlessly. I had goosebumps thinking about what was going through his head the entire time. This is a must watch."
christopher-cole83,"Jul 29, 2023",9/10,"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions."

yash-59415,"Jul 30, 2023",6/10,"I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing.The performances from the stellar cast are as expected phenomenal. The movie is good, well made but it does get boring at times. I expected more from the biopic of the father of the atom bomb."
adamleach-68147,"Aug 10, 2023",9/10,"Oppenheimer is a visually stunning film which tells a slow-paced, dialog-heavy story in a delightfully complex, creative, and fast-paced way.Due to the the sensitive subject matter and the fact that it's not entirely uncommon for us Americans too be a little too bombastic about, and proud of, our military conquests and history, going in I was afraid the story might come off a little too triumphant or nationalistic. But this movie intentionally, and successfully, rides a very dichotomous line that leaves you feeling uneasy at best for much of its run time.The juxtaposition between the rooms of people cheering at great scientific achievement and the potential (and hope) for it to end not just WW2 but war *itself*, against the horrific reality of what that scientific achievement could, and eventually *would*, be used for, leaves you a bit frozen. I am, admittedly, a rather sensitive person so while I watched the characters cheer and celebrate their years of hard work as they optimistically looked forward with hope for a better future, I found myself fighting back tears having known exactly what this invention would go on to do, both physically and psychologically. The more cheering I heard, the more disturbed I felt. And as much of the theater laughed at a ""joke"" a character made about not choosing a certain Japanese city to bomb, I (and some others) sat silently and solemnly, unable to laugh. I was overcome with great sorrow as I reflected on the fact that some of the men who were making the decision to drop this bomb were making it all too lightly. As they laughed and celebrated, many of them had no real grasp of the horror they were about to rain down on real people... Cities filled with culture and history... Homes filled with moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandchildren... 200,000+ innocent civilian lives lost through no fault of their own... As the film shows, there were many people who knew exactly what was going on and who were deeply afraid, and even regretful. But history also showed us that some people remained proud and braggadocios, having never fully grasping what they had helped do even after the destruction was done. Even today I still see people posting disturbingly un-empathetic, nationalistic memes laughing at and celebrating this event that caused generations of pain for real people.Much of this movie leaves you feeling unsure about how to feel about Oppenheimer himself--which I think that is the appropriate way to feel. That dichotomy is was makes this movie so great. You want to feel happy because you love science and achievement, you want to feel joy because a horrific war was finally coming to an end for one reason or another, you want to feel sorry for Robert because you know he has to live with this creation and the psychological effects of knowing what it has done and can still do, you want Robert to get justice after what the government put him through. But at the same time you mourn for the loss of life, you mourn for the generations of fear and pain that invention would go on to cause, you reflect on if it was worth it or if it was even necessary at all, you feel anger for the people who participated knowing full well what would happen, you even feel disgust at Oppenheimer himself. You are transported to 1940 and feel a genuine fear in thinking ""well, what IF the allied nations weren't the first to come up with this technology? What IF we were beat to the punch? What IF we never used it? What would have happened?"" while also feeling the experience of what it feels like to be fully human and filled with empathy for other humans, ""but what if the war could have ended without it? And if our enemies are monsters for their disregard for innocent human life in pursuit of their goals, doesn't that make us monsters too? Doesn't an eye for an eye make the world blind?"" Whether fearful or empathetic, all are valid questions, fears, and concerns. This dichotomy and constantly feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place is what it means to be human. And it's in that dichotomous space that this movie lives and proves to be a masterpiece.Switching gears briefly; the music, the sound effects, the cinematography, the acting, the wardrobe, the practical effects... it's all wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. They nailed it in so many ways. And let's not forget the fact that Kitty Oppenheimer is a whole mood. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job and I found myself laughing at many of her reactions on screen thinking ""this is actually, probably, the appropriate response."" LOL. And it probably goes without saying that Cillian and Robert Downey Jr were phenomenal. Just a really good experience all in all.And if you have the immense pleasure and privilege of living near one of the 30 theaters (worldwide) that plays this in true IMAX 15perf 70mm film... GO. Seeing this in 70mm film, in 4:3 aspect ratio, on a floor-to-ceiling screen is astounding. You must see it this way if you are a cinema head."
Luigi Di Pilla,"Feb 1, 2025",4/10,"I don't know why this documentary about the atomic bomb engineer Oppenheimer has so high votes here or did I see another movie?Of course it was a good idea to film how the physician team came together to construct this deadly nuclear arm that killed million of innocent people in Japan after the Second World War.But why was it streched to three hours running time with very boring and unnecessary dialog scenes? Why it loses itself in so many little details that didn't make any difference to the fact that Oppenheimer was finally responsible to create this nuclear weapon? Sorry, but what was really thinking the staff and how could it earn so many Oscar's? Okay, Cillian Murphy delivered another great performance and won.with my respect this Oscar. But what the hell justifies best director and best film for other two Oscars? Was it just to pay attention to this disastrous historical war event? Well, the last thirty minutes were soooo frustrating that I switched off. 4/10."
FollicallyChallenged,"Jul 24, 2023",N/A,"I was excited to watch a Christopher Nolan movie on a big screen for the first time. I'm glad, there is no IMAX near my location as it would've been a complete waste of money.This movie is an ATOMIC mess. Story is being told in a non-linear fashion which has become the norm these days but that made it more confusing. There were no subtitles and most of the times due to changing accents and speaking very slowly it became very hard to understand what they were saying at all.You don't feel ANYTHING about ANYONE. Women come and go like a flu. What was their purpose in the movie and Oppenheimer also had one of the most bizarre sex scene I've ever seen. Oppenheimer's wife's character is so badly written it's laughable. You don't understand anyone's intentions.Movies dealing with science are going to be complicated that's a given fact but they made it more complicated than it needed to be.I don't understand how are critics rating this movie so highly. This movie is not for an average audience that's what that implies."
nyymxksq,"Jul 31, 2023",10/10,"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry."
lorraineesimpson,"Aug 27, 2023",10/10,"I am definitely a Christopher Nolan fan and loved it but if you like action this isn't the film for you. This is quite a cerebral film, you need to pay attention to what's being said. There's a lot of talking, a lot of jumping back and forth, you need your brain switched on. It reminds me a lot of JFK actually.Cillian Murphy is simply sensational in this role. Completely believable and there is surely an Oscar heading his way for this. Robert Downey Jr is also very good as is Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Watson.As ever Nolan makes great use of the soundtrack to build that sense of tension and urgency, and silence is also used very effectively.This feels more like a documentary in parts, it's challenging more than entertaining and at 3 hours it's long although I felt the time passed quickly. It's yet another Nolan film which you can't help but admire but I appreciate it's not for everyone."
waltermwilliams,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!)
After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't.""
This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!"
mariosbenjamin,"Sep 22, 2024",8/10,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer left me feeling mentally drained-but not out of boredom. The sheer volume of information packed into the first 2.5-hour runtime made it challenging to stay fully alert and engaged throughout. However, by the final act, the film gave a satisfying sense that every shot and character played an essential role in its complex structure, a hallmark of Nolan's filmmaking.The film features numerous shots of characters' faces, which contributed to a feeling that I was mostly just seeing faces and eyes for much of the runtime. While these shots were well-executed, I wouldn't say they elevated my overall enjoyment.From a narrative perspective, Nolan doesn't provide enough room for reflection or understanding the deeper tensions between characters. The emotional relationships are underdeveloped, and this is a recurring weakness I find in many of his films. Nolan favors intricate, non-linear storytelling, which is creative and genius but often comes at the expense of emotional resonance and clear storytelling. He succeeds in conveying his messages, but it's frequently at the cost of the drama and depth that could have made the story more impactful.I also wouldn't call this Nolan's best work, worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director. Yet, the film's technical elements-from cinematography and music to camera composition, movements and the exceptional performances of the cast-are what truly elevate it. These aspects are critical to its success, as the movie itself wouldn't stand out as much without them."
siddharth56,"Jul 23, 2023",6/10,"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar."
ivanssh,"Oct 5, 2024",8/10,"It's a very good movie that's 100% worth watching. However, it will be much more enjoyable if you watch it after doing some research on the context and background of this character, who is so important to human history. I didn't do that, and at certain points in the plot, I got lost and didn't fully understand some of the events in the movie. In the future, I'll watch it again, but only after studying the topic of the movie a bit more.It's not an action movie by any means, but it's still very enjoyable, although it does feel a bit long. I missed seeing more footage of the explosion, especially those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It would have benefited the movie to show some of the suffering the poor Japanese civilians had to go through.I'd give it an 8/10, although I have a feeling it's the kind of movie that you end up liking more the more you watch it."
JayShermanLovitz,"Jul 22, 2023",5/10,I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.
keshawndevon,"Nov 29, 2023",8/10,"I really enjoyed this! The entire move I felt threatened by what was to come and then felt horrible after. Similar to a 3 act play, and the pacing felt good which I appreciated since the movie lasted for 3 hours.The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the color scheme at times. Sometimes the aesthetic felt like it distracted from or impeded the content-like I wondered how this would work on a home TV / computer / phone / etc.I also questioned if the nudity was completely necessary in the the scenes that had it. Some of them I felt were really important, others I talked with friends about because it didn't seem to add anything to the story."
meade-83001,"Sep 28, 2024",10/10,"Oppenheimer is set during World War II. J. Robert Oppenheimer is appointed to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. He and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work come to an end on July 16, 1945 when they witness the worlds first nuclear explosion forever changing the course of history.The theme that I feel fits this movie the beset if the consequences of scientific innovation. You can see this in the end of the film when they see the affects of the atomic bomb that is set off. You see the consequences of wilding power and the importance fo learning from history's lessons.Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy to prepare for his role Cillian read and listened to Oppenheimer's lectures. This helped him to be a great actor for his role. If you enjoyed this film, the film A Beautiful mind is a similar to Oppenheimer."
Dylpickle08,"Aug 11, 2024",10/10,"This film, which is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book American Prometheus, details the life of theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer and follows his early life, as well as the creation and aftermath of the atomic bomb. Overall due to an unbelievable ensemble cast and magnificent lead performance by Murphy, and surprisingly stupendous supporting performance by Damon, heart pounding score, perfectly paced transitions, and stunning visuals, this movie is expertly crafted by Nolan and very enjoyable and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, which is an insane statement for a courtroom drama focusing on the ethics and politics of war."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Jul 22, 2023",10/10,"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10."
Xstal,"Jul 26, 2023",8/10,"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations."
HorrorAndGore,"Jul 27, 2023",10/10,"It's not often I say that. Joker, American History X, and now Oppenheimer are 3 phenomenal movies that I'll never watch again.Why?Oppenheimer was a fantastic portrayal of Robert J. Oppenheimers life pre, during and post Manhattan Project.The atomic bomb scene was an absolute cinematic masterpiece, and one of the best film moments of recent years (or decades)
The movie is an incredibly heavy 3 hour biopic that never slows down. It's a heavy watch, but the payoff is phenomenal.Cillian Murphy puts on his best cinematic performance yet, and Christopher Nolan takes us through his story in an expertly crafted movie.It's as close as I can get to being a perfect movie, but one that I'll likely never revisit.If you haven't seen it, go while it's in Theatres."
alanvarghesester,"Jul 27, 2023",7/10,"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers."
getsanjay,"Nov 11, 2023",4/10,"I know my opinion may not be liked by Nolan fans, but I feel this movie was made unnecessarily complicated not because it helps the viewer or make it more entertaining but I feel just to portray a level of pseudo intelligence.Most of the time is spent trying to figure out which time period we are in with the multiple flash backs and flash forwards and even in the main two time periods also things are not kept chronological.In addition you need to either have a background of all the characters involved or then spend a lot of focus trying to remember which name belongs to which character as names are thrown left and right.And lastly I found the movie boring which is very rare for me as the subject was very interesting."
pretentiousmoviemaster,"Apr 20, 2025",N/A,"Firstly, the movie is too long, we can all agree on that. Nothing should be three hours long. The only actor keeping us from turning it off is Cillian Murphy as he makes his character so interesting.Most of the movie is fast cuts to the point you might as well watch something like family guy or continue scrolling on that fad website mindlessly one video to another. There's all this talking about nothing to just add unnecessary padding to the movies runtime and because of all the cuts to scenes that have almost nothing to do with one another you almost forget what you just watched so there may be times you have no idea what you just saw. I feel bad for those in a movie theater as they would have no abillity to rewind scenes. The makeup department finding different ways to age the actors did a great job, they nailed the atmosphere, the musical score worked but as usual Christopher Nolan's movies audio is all over the place, maybe it works in theaters but I had to keep turning my speakers up and down as I refuse to apply a compression filter to my speakers just to watch one movie. They had a golden opportunity to see how Robert Oppenheimer really felt after knowing the approximate casualties he caused. It didn't have to be the saddest movie ever made but it would have been a far better angle instead of what we usually get in the box office.I just found this extremely boring and over rated, I think if I was in the movie theaters and had the ""chance"" to see the barbie movie or oppenheimer which were in the theaters at the same time if memory serves me right I'd rather watch Barbie instead, this was 100 million down the toilet for hollywood."
cristanrafael,"Jul 19, 2023",8/10,"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the actingFantastic choice of B&W/color scenesHaunting and awesome score by Ludwig GöranssonThe dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity testBut I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film."
fancams,"Dec 12, 2023",9/10,"Oppenheimer is truly a biographical film with a captivating narrative. The focus is on the characters, and the depiction of nuclear weapon development is minimal. The bombings are not the central theme; rather, it delves into profound introspection. The film employs a significant amount of stream of consciousness, illusions, and auditory suppression to convey Oppenheimer's deep-seated anxiety and unease towards atomic energy. The culmination of events and arguments is stunning, leaving one speechless.The explosion begins from within; time is a mere technique, a means to reach destruction. Politics and human entanglements are superficial. By approaching the biographical aspect from a thriller's perspective, the explosions become silent, ecstasy turns terrifying, and interrogations become more jarring than bombs. The 'chain reaction' may literally mean the destruction of the world, or in another sense, not the end of World War II but the beginning of the Cold War. He witnesses firsthand the deathly inferno he helped create, entwined with both trembling and boundless fascination.In the tumultuous year of 2023, with such a restless movie-watching environment, it is remarkable that a film so composed, serious, slow-paced, and detached from the audience was made with a budget of 100 million dollars. Moreover, the film manages to capture the beauty of physics in real-life shots, a feat perhaps achievable only by someone like Nolan."
modefan,"Jul 26, 2023",10/10,"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!"
Bykso,"Nov 22, 2023",10/10,"An incredible film, I recommend it. Excellent acting, very well crafted plot. It's a good film to make us think about the Second World War as a whole, to make us think about how important the atomic bomb was in ending it. However, the film also shows the risks that this brought to the world after its creation. Everything has a positive and negative side, the film shows this very well and also shows how difficult it can be to make decisions, how difficult it can be to deal with your own influence, how difficult it can be to be at the top and think differently from how the government thinks. . It's a complicated film, you might not understand everything right away, but as the film goes on, things start to fall into place. What I recommend is that after watching the film, research the story, it will open your mind a little more and understand things better."
mukukachanda,"Aug 7, 2023",9/10,"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬"
chris-fussel,"Nov 29, 2023",10/10,"From the very beginning this movie pulls you in and you are left at the edge of your seat the entire 3 hours. First it doesn't feel like 3 hours all. Then the movie will stay with you for weeks afterwards. The timing for a movie like this is perfect as it has been said Sam Altman (the man mostly responsible for this revolution in AI we are all undoubtedly aware of) is a modern Oppenheimer in many ways. Not only this but I felt it was redemption for the man himself.I cannot recommend enough, due to the fact that many people have called this movie (boring) to read up on the manhattan project and J Robert Oppenheimer before watching. Read American Prometheus if you have the time or watch one of the many documentaries. It's worth doing as it enhances the experience even more. Consider the impact such a thing has had on the world. You do that and I just don't understand how anybody could possibly find this movie boring in any way.Cillian Murphy's performance is truly remarkable and he has earned his Oscar for this. In fact the entire cast really are at their best in this film. I thought I'd struggle watching Robert Downey Junior play anything other than Iron Man, let alone the bad guy in any film but he really nailed his role as Strauss. It should be mandatory viewing in my opinion for anyone and I truly cannot recommend this film enough. Christopher Nolan has never really disappointed and this is his masterpiece. I can't wait to see what he does next."
ofjfhejs,"Jul 25, 2023",5/10,"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher."
ghanemaldawsari,"Jul 20, 2023",10/10,"The movie delivers more than i even expected.It's Nolan masterpiece.The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.3 hours felt like 3 mins.This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.10/10 for me."
RebelHeartTV,"Sep 11, 2024",10/10,"Review originally written on 22nd July 2023.Review:
A question that many of us ask ourselves is ""How will I be remembered when I am gone?"" throughout our history humanity has accomplished so much. From the Wright Brothers successfully completing the first airplane flight in 1903, to Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon in 1969. These accomplishments are destined to remembered and looked back on fondly for the rest of time. But sometimes what is considered to be somebody's biggest achievement can become their biggest regret. This was the case for J. Robert Oppenheimer the American theoretical physicist who the media dubbed ""The father of the atomic bomb"", for his role as director of the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first ever nuclear weapons. Now director Christopher Nolan delivers his newest film, that tells the story of Oppenheimer and the creation of the weapon that would forever change the world, this is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.Christopher Nolan has crafted a work of art with this film, a monumental piece of cinema that will go down as a classic in years to come. Despite having a lengthy 180 minute run time, the pacing was perfection, I did not feel it drag or become tedious at all I was fully captivated by the spectacle I was witnessing on screen. The script for the film is immaculate and is arguably Nolan's magnum opus. The dialogue is expertly written. Every conversation between the characters is interesting and actually matters not one moment of the screenplay is wasted, something which many biopics before have failed to accomplish. The non-linear structure of the film, while a bit hard to grasp off in the beginning slowly begins to fall into place as the events in the story progress, the storytelling on display is a masterclass of filmmaking.The cast of this film give perfect performances across the board. Leading actor Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career, he manages to capture Oppenheimer's guilt, inner turmoil and fear with his facial expressions and eyes alone. You are witnessing a journey of a man proud of his genius mind, only to slowly devolve into a broken disheveled man being mentally tortured by what his own ego has unleashed upon the world. Cillian is simply magnificent and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination next year. Robert Downey Jr. Also puts on a career best and is a sure bet for a best supporting actor nomination. Another Oscar worthy performance in this film is Emily Blunt's she is brilliant.The production value for this film is immense. The fact that this film was made on a $100M budget and looks infinitely better than a lot of films released this year, with higher budgets is proof that more money doesn't mean quality. Nolan's defiance to use limited or lack there off CGI is commendable. He truly is a filmmaker that sets a huge standard for the quality of his filmography, and the use of a real explosion for the trinity test was something to behold on the IMAX screen. Composer Ludwig Göransson returns to compose his second score for Nolan. This score is phenomenal every single piece of music captures the corresponding scene beautifully, and can also be seen as an audio representation of Oppenheimer's inner psyche. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is jaw dropping. The use of black & white to represent scenes not from Oppenheimer's perspective are unique and are a major stand out, and of course the closing minutes are terrifying. That ending sent a chill down my spine and the close up of Cillian's face is haunting it takes a long time to leave your mind.Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of cinema. Nolan is going to have to create something truly special if he ever wants to try an outdo this magnificent piece. By the time the credits role you will be thinking about where humanity Is right now and how all it takes is a few buttons to bring about our destruction."
theogramps,"Dec 4, 2024",10/10,"I had the distinct pleasure of reading the book by Bird and Sherwin before I watched the movie. I cannot ever remember being so excited about a movie! Like Richard Rhodes seminal book on The Manhattan Project, ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"", ""American Prometheus"" is a ""can't put down"" read. Though somewhat of a late recommendation if you've already seen the movie, do take the time to read it, You'll come away with not only a better and more detailed account of his life, you will also come to understand what a tragic and shameful story it is, treating a national treasure like Oppie in the manner that we did."
jamesrupert2014,"Sep 6, 2024",9/10,"After successfully leading the billion-dollar Manhattan Project in the race to beat Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer deals with the ethical implications of the 'genie he let out' while finding himself under investigation as a national security risk. Apparently reasonably accurate (by Hollywood standards anyway), Christopher Nolan's film is a well-executed historical drama highlighted by outstanding cinematography. Cillian Murphy, who can pull off fine hat, is very good (even if he seems to be 'vogueing' occasionally for posters and lobby cards) as he heads up an ensemble cast who are given excellent material with which to work. I'm not a big fan of non-linear storytelling (I find the sudden shifts in perspective breaks up the narrative flow as I struggle to match up the numerous characters with their counterparts in other time-frames) but Nolan is very good at this sort of 'time-space' trick (of which 2017's 'Dunkirk' is an outstanding example). The only scenes I could have dispensed with were when 'Oppy' was being questioned and would briefly manifest his flashback in the present (eg when he recalls having sex with commie Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), suddenly we're treated to them 'in flagrante delicto' in the interrogation room - a silly, gimmicky and unnecessary flourish to an otherwise mature film). A tiny flaw (IMO) in an otherwise outstanding work."
atikainu,"Sep 6, 2024",9/10,"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a deep and complex biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb. With a riveting performance from Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, the film explores the moral dilemmas and huge impact of this scientific achievement. Nolan manages to combine dense narrative and historical elements with a distinctive visual style and deep character development. The dramatic musical score and captivating cinematography add to the movie's strengths. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a thought-provoking and highly engaging cinematic experience, making it one of the best biopics in recent years. The 9 rating reflects the exceptional quality of this movie, although some may find its long duration to be a challenge."
boseaditya-64891,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, to the last minute detail. Nolan was not kidding when he said that the movie was going to be bomb (literally).The screenplay and the cast selection, the writing, the delivery, the shooting. No words. I believe that there isn't any other movie that can compete with the craze and the movie itself. The only downside is that you can loose track of the movie if you don't stay focused.Seeing Robert Downey JR after endgame was really a sight for sore eyes, and the chemistry between all of the characters was something unreal!Summing it up, this is definitely a must watch along with Barbie (Oppenheimer better)."
ferryleblanc,"Jul 30, 2023",7/10,I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching between time lines.I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.
MoussaCine,"Oct 27, 2025",2/10,"I know a lot of people loved Oppenheimer, but honestly, it just didn't work for me. I respect the craftsmanship - the acting, visuals, and sound design are all top-tier - but as a story, it never made me feel anything. It's so focused on being intelligent and grand that it forgets to be human.The nonstop dialogue, rapid editing, and timeline jumps made it hard to stay emotionally connected. Instead of feeling the weight of what Oppenheimer did, I just felt lost in noise and exposition. Cillian Murphy is fantastic, but the movie doesn't let us sit with his emotions - it rushes from scene to scene trying to impress rather than move.For a film about the most devastating creation in human history, it should've hit harder. It told me everything about the man's mind, but almost nothing about his soul. 2/10 brilliant on paper, empty in feeling."
HarlequeenStudio,"Mar 2, 2024",N/A,"I won't rate this because I was not able to watch it to the end. I tried twice and managed to watch the first forty minutes. I wanted to like this film, but couldn't make myself watch more. This is when the director gets in his own way by overusing the methods that worked well in his previous films. The sound actually gets in the way of whatever the characters are saying. The CONSTANT sound in the backrgound was like being stuck in a traffic jam with nowhere to go and escape the noise. I either could not hear or was unable to concentrate on the dialog. And because the story constantly switched from now, to the past, then to some near future, then further down the rabbit hole, I seriously couldn't find any other way out but to turn it off. It's a shame, because I like all the actors involved and I'm wishing them best of luck at the Oscars."
towardsmoke,"Nov 27, 2023",10/10,"In the realm of historical dramas, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a towering achievement, a masterfully crafted cinematic tapestry that weaves together the complexities of science, the weight of human responsibility, and the profound impact of technological advancements on the course of history.At the heart of the film lies Cillian Murphy's captivating portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, a top-secret endeavor to develop the world's first atomic bomb. Murphy delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Oppenheimer's intellectual prowess, unwavering determination, and the moral anguish that comes with wielding such immense power.Nolan's meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout the film, from the meticulously recreated laboratory settings to the visceral depiction of the Trinity test, the first successful detonation of an atomic bomb. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography adds to its intensity, heightening the sense of urgency and gravity that permeates every scene.""Oppenheimer"" is not merely a historical biopic; it is a profound exploration of the human condition, delving into the complexities of ambition, guilt, and the consequences of scientific innovation. Nolan deftly balances the historical narrative with introspective moments, allowing the audience to gain insights into Oppenheimer's inner turmoil as he grapples with the implications of his creation.The film's supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring standout performances from Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, and Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project. Each character is brought to life with depth and nuance, adding layers of complexity to the intricate narrative.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on audiences. It is a film that demands to be seen, a thought-provoking exploration of science, morality, and the enduring legacy of one man's extraordinary contribution to the world."
RM851222,"Jul 21, 2023",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other."
jace_the_film_guy,"Sep 16, 2024",8/10,"Bringing the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen, while also paying careful respect to all parties, was a large task. Christopher Nolan succeeded and this film deserves all the praise that it gets. Yes, it is exhausting to get through, but that is kind of the point.There is not a single bad performance in the bunch. RDJ poured his heart into the role, especially as an old man. Cillian Murphy was crisp and brilliant. Matt Damon was powerful. Emily Blunt was jaw-dropping, specifically in the courtroom scene.While every performance was extraordinary, I'm not sure that every character was necessary. I understand that Nolan wanted to stay true to the source material, but every five minutes there would be an important new name and face. I felt like I needed to take notes on each character.The film does an admirable job of navigating different timelines and the complicated elements of this true story. The pacing really picks up once Matt Damon's character in introduced and kept my attention throughout. That being said, and I hate to say it, but I think that I would have liked the project more as a 4 part series.The film is visually impressive and the score sets the stage throughout. Though the idea of Oppenheimer is larger than life, the movie (much like the lead character) truly succeeds is in the quiet moments.Best Character: Oppenheimer

bklgreene,"Mar 4, 2024",8/10,"If the scene cuts weren't so jarring and maybe years posted in the scenes which flip back and forth I'd give it a 10/10. Sure I could assume this scene was late 1939 and that scene was 1941/1942 and this scene was 1955 but it was very confusing and until halfway or so through the movie I was guessing most of the time. Fantastic movie overall though, lead actor was phenomenal, I loved the twists that came through the movie knowing just enough to be dangerous about Oppenheimer the man I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for entertainment and education with a grain of salt. RDJs character seemed a bit weak for him and the portrayal of the President seemed odd to me."
laurentnroussel,"Jul 24, 2023",6/10,"On the + side:
Good cinematography
Good acting (especially Robert Downey Jr)
Interesting story (quite reminiscent of the Alan Turing story)On the - side:
Dialog heavy
Annoying music almost non stop. Was actually hoping it would pause at times!The explosion is quite underwhelming. Didn't really feel the sheer devastating power of the bomb
I had hoped I would actually lean more on how they came up with building an A bomb
Felt long...All in all, quite disappointed and although beautifully shot, I never felt it deserved the 70mm treatment (especially since a good portion of the movie is set in meeting rooms or court rooms) and all the marketing around recreating the explosion. The original footage is actually more scary!"
ojiosteve,"Aug 13, 2023",4/10,"SO classic, as soon as there's a movie with a somewhat 'deeper' meaning, people would praise it beyond.measure and even talk about oscars...even though there are SO many other movies that are way..WAY better than this one. But i guess it's all about the genre that counts, not the actual movie. If it's a horror or comedy flick, it can't be good right? Well...it's not an entirely 'bad' movie but literally nothing's happening for 3 hrs straight. The whole movie is just one long dialogue...for 3 hrs.There is no action, nothing for 'the eyes'. You could easily just listen to the movie and you wouldn't miss a thing. So, if that's what you're hoping for, skip this one.Everybody is acting very well but let's not beat around the bush...it's hella boring.If this movie is going to win anything, it's just goes to show how damn shallow people are. All that matters is the idea of the subject..not the outcome."
ExtremeCloseUp,"Jan 10, 2025",N/A,"Nolan tries his luck at the biography genre for the first time, but still treats it as a blockbuster. One could blame the overambitious scope of the project, which tries to fit too much even for a running time of 3 hours. That includes the brilliance of his scientific work, the urgency of the atomic race during WWII, the struggles in his personal life, the consequences of his connections to the communist party that he couldn't shake off, the aftermath of Hiroshima/Nagasaki among others. As a result, Oppenheimer is extremely heavy in dialogue - even though the nuclear physics parts are kept to a reasonable length and depth, all these scientists' names that are being brought up without said person being present in that scene can be confusing to the viewer - uses epic, bombastic music - which is somewhat overused and could have been even more effective if it wasn't constantly attacking the audience - and aggressive editing along with a non linear narrative in order to keep a blistering pace while building suspense and momentum. This maximalist approach takes its toll on the viewer and creates an exhausting watching experience that hardly leaves any room to breathe.Another complaint would be that the movie is rather uneven. On the one hand, The Manhattan Project / Los Alamos Laboratory / Trinity part was the clear highlight. On the other hand, the juxtaposition of Oppenheimer being trapped by Lewis Strauss to a hopeless hearing with Strauss suffering the same fate himself was a nice touch, but it wasn't really necessary for such a large part of the movie to turn into courtroom drama.Still, it can't be denied that Oppenheimer is a cinematic spectacle. It does a commendable job at showing the events from Oppenheimer's point of view - unlike a typical biopic, he isn't presented as a hero or a villain, the movie takes no side in that debate - in no small part thanks to Murphy's excellent performance. A great example would be the scene where he delivers the victory speech and the full scale of his ""achievement"" becomes clear to him. Even the fancy visuals such as the visions of the atoms, the universe or the nuclear reactions are a welcome addition."
rubycat-71309,"Dec 2, 2023",9/10,"This movie was, in short, a masterpiece. The dialogue, the perfectly timed shots, it swept me off my feet. Cillian Murphy played his role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for a better performance. If I had one critique, it would be the lengthiness of the film. It was a bit long for me, and while I understand it had to be a longer film for the whole plot to unfold I felt that at the last 30 minutes or so I unfortunately got a bit exhausted at the prospect of the film continuing much longer. Though, that said, I very rarely write reviews of anything, but I felt this particular movie was more than deserving of my attention and time."
fatemehb-30812,"Dec 5, 2023",9/10,"I don't know what to say about this film, but it was amazing!!! I had several emotions going on in me watching this. One moment I was shocked, other moment excited, the other angry, and some moment sad and disappointed. I can't really talk about how incredibly wonderful it was. The saddest part about the movie, was that you knew you're literally watching the reality in a movie:(
basically, it's about Robert Oppenheimer who invented the atomic bomb and made it with the help of other scientists.NOTE: it's better to learn a little about history of world was II before starting to watch this. I decided to do that because in that case it was easier to imagine how was the situation back then."
elhamfirmino,"Jul 27, 2023",10/10,"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique."
outrunkid,"Jul 29, 2023",10/10,"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023."
cardsrock,"Aug 10, 2023",9/10,"I'm a Nolan fanboy, but I'll be honest, I was not terribly excited for this film. An extremely long, talky drama about a historical event didn't seem up my alley, but man was I glued to the screen for the entire 3 hour experience. Nolan has mastered the skill of heavy dialogue with quick cuts to keep things moving and engaging. He lets the little moments breathe too, it's not all breakneck speed. This balance makes for a highly enjoyable viewing experience.Murphy is outstanding and may be the favorite for Best Actor as it stands. Speaking of that award, there are Oscar winners littering the screen here all delivering fine performances. The production design is top notch and the Trinity test is one of the coolest things put to film.I know there is a lot of divisiveness about the final third of the film, but I'm shocked by this. I found it to be the real meat of the story. Digging deeper into the implications of the bomb on Oppenheimer's life and the world as a whole is more interesting than just seeing a recreation of what happened. I was utterly captivated for the entirety of the incredible film. Mr. Nolan has done it yet again."
teavrdoljak-82913,"Jul 28, 2023",6/10,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)"
agnethemus,"Jul 30, 2023",10/10,"Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.Highly recommend although i recommend you give it your full attention when watching otherwise you might miss key elements. But if you've seen Nolan's other films, then you are familiar with his way of portraying timelines.The casting in this was perfect and everyone delivered above and beyond.Also, the way Nolan illustrated Oppenheimer's feelings and emotions was so clever and powerful.The 3 hours flew by. I was entertained and kept engaged throughout the entire film.A terrifying and important event in history beautifully visualized in this film."
SimCinSpirit,"Aug 22, 2023",7/10,"TL:DR. - Too long, kind of dull. Didn't care for any of the characters.""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's latest, brings together a monumental cast that delivers notably strong performances, particularly from Murphy and Downey Jr. Ludwig Göransson's score is a haunting backbone to the film's technical prowess. However, the movie's pacing suffers from its nonlinear structure and a convoluted array of characters, often overshadowing its more profound moments. While technically impressive, the film may be too intricate for its own good, struggling to consistently engage its audience throughout its three-hour run. Nolan aficionados might find value, but others may find it wanting."
Otte1,"Jan 25, 2025",4/10,"Take a look at the 10 star reviews. Look at how 'professionally' written they are, almost too perfect. Because they are not written by a human.This one is.Pros. There is some revealing information about how the atomic bomb came to play. It was interesting seeing the difference in theories from miliary, scientists and politicians.Cons. The non-linear timeline did ABSOLUTELY nothing to this movie. It only confused it because you kept having to wonder it you were looking at pre WWII, during WWII, after WWII, or in the 1950's. Nonlinear timelines only work when there is a 'big reveal', while here they do not serve a purpose. Plus, because you do not know the characters, you are not sure why you are skipping around.The director's decision to have some musical score happening on most scenes were very distracting and downright annoying. Then on the biggest scene where I'm expecting a noise, he made the decision to go silent....just stupid.I don't mine 3-hour movies, but give me a reason to be 3 hours. This movie could have been an one-hour documentary and I would have understood more on what happened.Director Christopher Nolan is following the footsteps of Guy Ritchie, M. Night Shymalan....they start off visionaries and after a couple of movies they start believing their own hype and go off the rails."
tobysen,"Sep 11, 2023",N/A,"A three-hour-long movie, with over 80% of its plot centered around discussions at a table, filled with dialogues, not about how to make an atomic bomb, but entirely focused on politics and arguments, devoid of action sequences, and might even say, lacking a coherent storyline.If I were watching this kind of dialogue-driven plot on a streaming platform, I would likely skip through it. However, because I was in a cinema, I found myself dozing off several times.The plot unfolds within these debates, and all the scenes are quite fragmented, with each segment lasting just one or two minutes. The scene transitions are incredibly rapid, and there is no overarching narrative. The only semblance of continuity is Oppenheimer's extramarital affair, but in reality, this love affair is somewhat irrelevant to the movie.As for Oppenheimer's inner journey and his torment and ambivalence regarding inventing the atomic bomb, I must say it was hard to empathize. Due to the lack of a complete storyline, it's challenging to connect with these characters, making it difficult to immerse oneself and truly understand Oppenheimer's emotional experiences. In comparison, similar biographical films like ""The Social Network,"" which also employ a debate-driven narrative, and ""The Imitation Game"" are clearly superior and not as chaotic as this movie."

rudrakshkikani,"Jul 29, 2023",10/10,"One of the greatest directors of our generation - Christopher Nolan has produced yet another masterpiece. Recency bias compels me to crown Oppenheimer as the greatest Nolan film ever. Right from the casting, to the costumes, to the set, to the screenplay, to the dialogue writing, to the soundtrack, it is perfection.Cillian Murphy is beyond brilliant as J. Robert Oppenheimer and I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Oppenheimer better. RDJ reigns supreme as Luis Strauss, one of the great supporting acts in movies.Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work, this is where Christopher Nolan comes to life. This is where Cinema comes to life.If possible, witness this once-in-a-generation film in IMAX. This is a beautiful composition of reality, science, and history.Christopher Nolan, on behalf of the entire human race, thank you."

lianlana,"Dec 8, 2023",9/10,"""Oppenheimer,"" a thought-provoking documentary, delves into the intricate life and enduring legacy of a key figure in the scientific world. The film seamlessly combines historical footage, interviews, and dramatized scenes to paint a nuanced picture of the individual at the center of the atomic age.Structured chronologically, the documentary takes the audience through the formative years of the scientist, tracing the trajectory of his career against the backdrop of a world engulfed in geopolitical tensions. The film effectively captures the moral quandaries faced by the scientific community during the development of the atomic bomb, shedding light on the complex interplay between intellect, ambition, and ethical responsibility.The casting choices contribute to the documentary's authenticity, with the lead actor delivering a compelling portrayal of the central figure. The supporting cast further enhances the narrative, embodying key historical figures and providing a well-rounded view of the socio-political context.Visually, the film is a triumph, seamlessly blending archival footage with carefully crafted reenactments. The attention to period details in cinematography and production design transports viewers to the era, immersing them in the scientific and political landscape of the time.While the documentary excels in its comprehensive exploration of the scientific and geopolitical aspects, some may find the pacing a bit slow, particularly during in-depth scientific explanations. Additionally, a more profound exploration of the personal life of the central figure and a deeper examination of the aftermath of the atomic bombings could have added further dimensions to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a well-executed documentary that invites audiences to contemplate the complexities surrounding scientific innovation, moral responsibility, and the far-reaching consequences of groundbreaking discoveries. Without delving into specific names, the film remains a captivating exploration of the human side of scientific achievement, leaving viewers with a lingering contemplation of the ethical implications of technological advancements in the context of war."
SeaBassist,"Jul 31, 2023",10/10,"I went to see Barbenheimer with high hopes for this because I've been anticipating it since it was announced and this was truly the most excited I'd had been for a film in a while. My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war.There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. I'm truly stunned at the passion, dedication and effort put into this absolute masterclass in film-making. The film is 3 hours long but none of the scenes are boring, quite the contrary, and it goes by much faster. The camera work and lighting is absolutely phenomenal, which really isn't surprising when Hoyte van Hoytema is your cinematographer. The use of extremely bright lights to mimic the explosion of the bomb, as well as to convey a feeling of anxiety, panic and guilt is incredibly well thought out and used extremely appropriately. The performances are also out of this world : Emily Blunt is extraordinary, Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing, Matt Damon is great, David Krumholtz is so fun to watch, Benny Safdie is dramatic but not to the point of being melodramatic and delivers a great performance, Florence Pugh really delivers as well, and not to mention Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most well-casted performances of all time. The writing is phenomenal, the character work is phenomenal, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the cinematography is phenomenal ; what more can I say except that Oppenheimer is truly one of the most breathtaking pieces of media ever made."
Jojo-Xingyi,"Aug 20, 2023",7/10,"Oppenheimer is a overall mediocre film. It depends too much on sound effects, and loud, sudden flashes as seen in the beginning, the only thing that makes the film engaging to the audience. There is a lot of unnecessary content, and is hard to understand even for Christopher Nolan standards. The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie. It would've been better for the film if the bombs were shown dropped in the beginning and have the story told in a reversed manner."
