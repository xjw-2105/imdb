Lk1990,"Apr 30, 2020",9/10,"Fight Club does exactly what movies should do, blow our minds, make us ask questions of ourselves and our society, and all the while thoroughly entertain us. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are at their very best."
shuklaprakhar,"Dec 18, 2018",10/10,"Beleive me if you want to feel this movie to the core watch it twice . It took me twice to analyse that this movie was something much more than just awesome
Brilliant acting by brad pitt maybe his best one, direction above par .
There is something much more in this movie than meets the eye .. Watch it and find for yourself"
johnnysilverhand-13047,"Oct 3, 2019",10/10,"I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.I saw it again when I was 13 and just started seeing movies for what they were - a language. A language through which the filmmakers interpret their own views on the world. I understood more of it, especially being part of ""the middle children of history"" generation.After that, I saw it at least once per year and every single time, I realized something new or different about it, and the world itself. I grew with this movie both intellectually and spiritually.Still took me another 12 years to understand this movie is THE textbook for Jungian psychology BESIDES already being the single greatest social critique of the consumer era.It's ridiculously smart, deep, beautiful and cool. I've watched basically every movie out there, and nothing comes even close to the degree of greatness of Fight Club."
Pukeonthestreet,"Feb 11, 2020",10/10,Because you'll probably be confused the first time around. It's not a coincidence it stars some of the greatest actors of our time.
trosati-98923,"Oct 12, 2019",10/10,"So rewatchable. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing the second time you watch it, very good acting, funny as well sometimes. Great movie."
jack_o_hasanov,"Jul 28, 2021",10/10,I have no words about this film. This is masterpiece cult film.10 / 10.
grantss,"Apr 19, 2014",10/10,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic."
sebastiandelgah,"Oct 11, 2018",10/10,"This movie is one of the greatest of all time. It is adapted from a book by Chuck Palahniuk.
This movie has very interesting themes like emasculation, violence, chaos, societal breakdown, isolation, the threat of death and consumerism.
The direction is sublime. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly. Also they did a good job with the inter-cuts.
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were the perfect choice to lead this movie.
When you are watching the movie you just are glued to your seat, that is just how good it is."
buk-3,"Oct 15, 1999",10/10,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.L."
Ruskington,"Aug 26, 2020",7/10,"I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves."
family9101,"Sep 2, 2025",4/10,"Fight Club is a film that many have elevated to cult status, but for us it provokes more irritation than admiration. At its core, it's a story about a group of people who, instead of finding healthy ways to deal with their inner crises, plunge headlong into self-destruction. They methodically hurt themselves and everyone around them, while the film tries to present this as some profound philosophy of freedom and meaning.In the end, there's no real depth-only the illusion of it. On the surface, everything looks stylish: slick visuals, a charismatic Brad Pitt, a moody atmosphere. But that's just the packaging. The content boils down to glorifying a masochistic, antisocial lifestyle. We're asked to admire people who mistake real rebellion for tearing everything apart, including themselves.What's especially amusing is that this movie is often called a ""man's film."" In reality, it's more like a boy's fantasy of masculinity, where chaos and violence are mistaken for strength. There's nothing genuinely mature here-only the romanticizing of fists and destruction.And if this film feels important to anyone, it's really closer to a teenage rite of passage: that first rush of ""freedom"" when everything seems allowed, when blood and chaos feel like proof of power. But with age, it becomes painfully clear there's no real idea behind it, no resolution-just empty bravado.The worst part is that many genuinely treat Fight Club as an ""icon of a generation."" For us, it's more like a manifesto for people chasing meaning in chaos, though in reality there's no meaning, no answers, no solid philosophy-only emptiness dressed up in pseudo-wisdom. And that's the real danger of the film: it looks intelligent, but underneath it's nothing more than a glossy wrapper around senseless self-destruction.We honestly don't understand why this film resonates with so many. Maybe it's the romanticized rebellion, maybe the illusion of depth-but in practice it feels like an overrated mess that works better as a collection of edgy quotes than as a complete story.Once, my husband gave it a 6/10. After rewatching it together, we both agreed it only gets worse with time. A fair score now is no higher than 4/10. And even that feels generous, considering the movie essentially sells a flashy but utterly useless set of ideas."
richardjohndecker,"Dec 26, 2021",9/10,"Fight club is not at all what I expected, but I was surprisingly ecstatic about what the movie was. A terrifically made thriller that builds suspence and keeps you invested throughout the entirety of the film. Be warned the film is incredible through the first watch and provides a different perspective the second time."
angryleprechaun,"Jul 10, 2021",10/10,"The movie is phenomenal. I liked every single actor, the story was great and had some plot twists. It kept me engaged thoroughly and I was never bored. I only watched it for first time in my life a month ago, and I suggest you to do the same if you haven't!"
KrisRagnarsson,"Feb 4, 2003",N/A,"I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than I can remember.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the nearest videostore!5/5"
gogoschka-1,"Dec 16, 2013",10/10,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

Good to see the system works"
MrPupkin,"Oct 22, 2019",10/10,"Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb. However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever."
dr. gonzo,"May 10, 2000",10/10,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens."
TheLittleSongbird,"May 18, 2010",9/10,"Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
perica-43151,"Jul 21, 2018",7/10,"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit."
TheHassanHanif,"Sep 15, 2020",5/10,"Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated."
saveliydalmatov,"Dec 29, 2023",10/10,"If you read the opinions about the film from different sites from different people, you can find out that basically you will either adore ""Fight Club"", or in the opposite direction you will dislike it to the same extent. I am one of the first. Moreover, this is probably my favorite movie.I liked everything here - from the actors' acting to the plot itself or the production of shots. The film is at least memorable and obviously will not leave anyone indifferent. The plot and motivation of the characters have long been known to everyone, if not, then it's for the best, a brief description and understanding will be enough for you.It's up to you to decide whether to watch or not. For me, according to the assessment and the above-written - ""... favorite movie ... "" I do not need to write a lot about my opinion.Speaking about this particular painting, it is difficult to say anything. Each person will accept it in their own way. But if you look objectively, you can see that this is a classic and most are delighted. And isn't that a reason to try it anyway?)"
robertharkins,"Sep 24, 2001",10/10,"The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign.  The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters.  This is one of the most underrated movies I know.I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both.  Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or The Matrix really should check it out."
lastliberal,"Oct 14, 2007",9/10,"I wasn't prepared for an existential trip about life. I thought it was just going to be about fighting. I was wrong.The line in my title grabbed me because I have always thought about ""stuff"" and how it ties you down. People can't get divorced when the love is gone because of ""stuff."" People can't move to a better location because of ""stuff."" ""Stuff"" is choking us all.It is like the Kipling poem:If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss;then you will be a man!Besides, ""stuff."" we are chocked by consumerism; which may be the same thing. The film is replete with phallic symbols and decries the femininization of men.""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""Fight Club gives us an emphatic NO to that question. But, then, what is Marla's role? To show us that we are lying to ourselves? Hmmm.This film had brilliant performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, under the superb direction of David Fincher. It deserves multiple watchings."
Dante Hicks,"Jun 25, 2000",10/10,"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 3, 2007",9/10,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 29, 2023",10/10,"An Office worker spends his time looking for fulfilment in various support groups, when he randomly encounters a soap maker named Tyler Durden, the pair discover a mutual, but strange and violent past time.There is no doubt in my mind, Fight Club is one of the best films of all time, a story like no other, even for someone that doesn't care for this film, I'm sure they'd agree that it's original.Fight Club is fast paced, action packed, intriguing, sexy, revealing and timeless, it's one of those films that it doesn't matter how many times you watch it, it doesn't lose any of its appeal. At times it is genuinely outrageous, and therein is its monumental appeal.Helena Bonham Carter steals so many films, and she's terrifiic here, but it's the combination of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt that makes the film, they are outstanding, I still think it's Norton's best performance to date.The wonderful, late Meatloaf adds a nice bit of humour.The moral of Fight Club......don't have the soup.10/10."
trildog99,"Mar 2, 2004",10/10,"To be honest with you, when I saw the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be another mindless action film.  But then something happened.....I actually watched it.  I thought the movie was genius.  It wasn't so much about fighting.  It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered from insomnia.  Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly.  Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep.  With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems.  I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10."
golight,"Oct 18, 1999",10/10,"Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender."
baileycrawly,"Aug 11, 2020",6/10,"Fight Club isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly as good as people make it out to be.It really comes off as a pretentious piece of work for film students to study to the point of exhaustion, but I don't think it was ever intended to be that. The movie plays out, with a few key alterations, as a scene-by-scene retelling of the book, sometimes going so far as to lift paragraphs of inner monologue directly from the novel and plopping them into the script.It's a movie that requires at least two viewings but, beyond that, it gets boring in a pretty big hurry. Particularly toward the end of the second act/beginning of the third, it's so painfully bland and boring that it's difficult to care about anything that's happening at all (around the whole Project Mayhem stuff). It's difficult to maintain any kind of focus throughout.There's a lot of stuff hidden in this movie for people to go back and revisit, too, but most of it is inessential. Honestly, having looked back at some of the Easter eggs, it leaves the question: who cares? And of course this is an unpopular opinion to have, but I held off on reviewing this title in the honest hopes that multiple viewings would raise the rating. I even read Palahniuk's novel to try to derive some additional meaning out of it.Without giving away the ending, it makes you think, and it creates a nice gimmick to get people to watch it again but, as I said, beyond that I'm perfectly happy to close the chapter on this one and leave it in the past.The first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club. And I'm happy to be done talking about this one for a good long while."
fcarrot,"Sep 17, 1999",9/10,"First and Second rule of Fight Club: Don't talk about Fight Club. So I guess I wont. But what I will say is that this movie will blow your mind, and iam not exaggerating. This is one hell of a crazy cinematic experience. Warning! You will never quite view liposuction the same way again."
camiloarenivar,"Dec 6, 2001",9/10,"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999."
WesleyWaller,"Jan 2, 2020",10/10,"A wonderful film. The depth of character structure is close to perfection. It beckons the question, when reality, fantasy, and mental illness collide could any of us withstand the torment within. It is as much horror film as it is dark humor. Brilliantly written and acted, it is a must see for any true cinephile!"
tyler.td,"Nov 29, 1999",10/10,After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.
rmic,"Feb 15, 2000",10/10,"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film."
GirlDad85,"Oct 21, 2021",8/10,"The last time that I watched Fight Club was probably 15 or so years ago. I've seen it probably 2 or 3 times up until then. I remember in my youth/young adulthood I just remember loving the movie. I would have gave it a 9-10 all day. Now that I'm older I realize I may have been overrating it a bit. Yes, the movie is good with solid acting, good plot, and great shots. However, it is just missing something for me now. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it is the last 30 minutes or so. The ending just felt rushed to me when certain things are starting to make sense for the main character."
engxladso-1,"May 17, 2013",10/10,"I had avoided this movie as I had assumed it was 'Rocky Goes Underground'. Saw it last night (May 2013) only because my son wanted to watch it and I was too tired to get off the couch. I was totally blown away. It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie.Can't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.I unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism."
uhmartinez-phd,"Dec 5, 2007",5/10,"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside."
emily_emily_emily,"Dec 16, 2024",10/10,"I want to give Chuck palaniuk a fat kiss on the brain for coming up with this book, I want to kiss David Fincher on the brain for bringing it to life on the big screen. I want to give Brad Pitt and Edward Norton each a kiss on the brain for bringing the narrator and Tyler to life. I love fight club, amazing movie for an amazing book. If you haven't read the novel yet, DO IT!!!!!! DO IT NOW!!!!!Soundtrack? Banging. Cinematography? Gasp worthy. I love you.I had to beg my friends (on my knees) to watch it with me, but they walked out as changed men. The power of fight club is a strong force, which is not to be taken lightly."
tsgamemaster,"Dec 10, 2024",10/10,"I'm a huge movie buff, and never have I sat through a movie as intense, gripping, well acted, directed, and incredibly written as fight club. I wish I could talk about it but the number one rule is, you can't. So I won't talk about anything that'll spoil it. First off. This movie is a work of art and is the reason I'm an inspiring screenwriter. There's so much they got right in this movie. 1. It has a clear vision and allows us audience to fall in love with a whole new directing style (for its time) almost. 2. The characters feel real and the chemistry is gold. 3. The plot is crazy but it works so well. Just, watch it if you havnt. Pls."

Tony-Kiss-Castillo,"Jan 15, 2024",10/10,"If ever there were a Film in a CLASS ALL OF ITS OWN.... FIGHT CLUB IS IT!But before diving in.... FIRST... Let us FOCUS on the Title´s Content and Context:Surrender to FIGHT CLUB...A No-Holds-Barred Knockout! If you haven't seen it...See it! If you HAVE...See it again! In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT... Or shrewdly pretended not to! Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!Here is a film that almost cries out, ""HATE ME! DESPISE ME!"" An occasional film will step gingerly on the toes of audience sensibilities. Fight Club drop kicks them!Yet, it is so relentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantalizing...you will LOVE it...and then HATE yourself for it! Make no mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic Hollywood film.The term ""Ride"" is employed so freely to movies today, that it has become rather meaningless. Fight Club re-invents the word! Literally, from the DNA Roller-coaster opening Credits (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical equivalent of a sustained amyl-nitrate rush!), to the metaphoric wailing (""We're still men!"") of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton-Bonham Carter-Pitt, to the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise-control, hyper-consumeristic lifestyles......FIGHT CLUB synthesizes both our pent-up frustration and our self-induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE #1...""You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!"" This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one ""RIDE"" you CERTAINLY DO NOT want to miss!10**********.....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"
afroman-3,"Oct 4, 1999",10/10,"You would only do a flick like Fight Club if you had total disregard for the opinion of (so called) critics, because of the gargantuan leap into unknown territory.  Fight Club is more of an experience than a 2-hour way to forget yourself.  It could of been 5 hours, I would not have known the difference. Although dark, it is truly the best film I have seen, period.  Pitt and Norton are both genius...truly out there as actors.The range of Fincher is amazing...dark to serious to funny to Holy Crap!See what happens when you take a chance?  Must see."
jonnasbittencourt,"Dec 2, 2024",7/10,"Fight Club is overrated. When you love a movie and someone else says is overrated, it sounds like they're saying the movie's bad. That's not what im saying at all, is far from being bad, it has some great moments, but it's not a great movie. Norton and Pitt are pretty good, the soundtrack is amazing, the editing and sound design are also good. However, the plot is convoluted and absurd to the point of being annoying, not to mention the ""twist"" that makes almost zero sense. I like David Fincher, but this is not his best work, his direction feels too heavy handed here. Good movie, but overrated."
Decko_koji_obecava,"Mar 21, 2003",3/10,"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc.When all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, ""Fight Club"" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe ""go let it out"" or ""if it feels good do it"". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. ""I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom"", he reasons. Until..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.The story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal ""Being John Malkovich"" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to ""Fight Club"" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices."
mathisbohnhorst,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"Im kinda speechless, I just watched the movie and I can probably say, that it is the best movie I have ever watched! I have never written review for a movie and I don't really know how to write a good one. But after this movie I went strait to the review section and started typing. The story of the movie is genius, the two character play together like nothing else. Everybody who hasnt watched the movie, definitely needs to do it, eventho it is probably not for everybody. You will either love it or hate it but it is a must watch!"

lynxcallen,"Dec 15, 2024",10/10,"Fight Club is one of those movies that sticks with you. It's not just about guys fighting in basements-it's way deeper. Ed Norton nails that whole ""lost guy"" vibe, and Brad Pitt as Tyler? Unreal. He's got that wild, untouchable energy. Together? They kill it.The story's layered: identity, control, freedom, all that stuff. You think it's one thing, then boom-the twist flips everything. It's raw, gritty, and full of moments that make you go, ""Whoa, what's even real?""The dialogue? Sharp and loaded. Stuff like, ""You are not your job"" or ""The things you own end up owning you"" hit hard. Plus, the visuals are insane-dark, edgy, perfect for the vibe. And that ending? Pure chaos but so fitting.It's not for everyone, sure. It's violent, it's intense, and it messes with your head. But if you're into movies that make you think-like really think-this one's for you. No fluff, just raw energy. IOU a good time if you give it a shot."
plastikshine,"Sep 6, 2019",10/10,"When I first saw Fight Club, I was sitting dumbfounded for 10 minutes after it ended and titles went on.
This is pure masterpiece. Everything in this movie is perfect and creates a whole ideal picture. THE CAST. I adore and admire Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. The colours, the light. The image and vision of the city that inflames and creates a constant tension. Emotions and mental state of the narrator, feelings and condition he experiences, especially in the beginning scenes - I felt it to the bone.
Worth multiple rewatching - you will notice new things and details every time.
Final scene brings goosebumps.
David Fincher is a genius."
badfeelinganger,"Sep 19, 2014",10/10,"Solid Acting and Amazing Direction A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness both geopolitical and especially economic, that would erupt globally in the decade to come. Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool. Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.Essential Hollywood film of 1999."
filmquestint,"Feb 6, 2005",5/10,"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough."
elenabatrshin,"Apr 26, 2023",10/10,"Fight Club is an American film directed by David Fincher. It is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter are perfectly cast as the three lead characters.Narrator(Edward Norton) is an unnamed ordinary guy who works for an insurance company. He makes a decent salary, he can afford every material good the heart could desire, but the man is deeply depressed and develops insomnia.The Narrator starts attending self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people in these groups and meets another 'fake' named Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter).His life changes when he meets a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden being a rebel and an anarchist convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots. Then Tyler and The Narrator realize that they love fighting because it makes them feel alive and ""real."" After that Durden decided to start fight clubs across the country; and eventually turns the clubs into aggressive criminals releasing their hatred on corporate America.Everything is amazing about this film: the gripping plot, the acting, the soundtrack, the plot twist. I wanna talk more details but we all know rule #1.My only criticism would be that I can't erase my memory and watch it for the first time again.Not only is this a complex and absolutely thrilling film, but also it's thought-provoking and tackles some seriously deep issues, such as social pressure, consumer culture and radicalization.Strongly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.10/10."
anitacareer,"Jul 16, 2007",9/10,A woman needs to speak up for Helena Bonham Carter's incredible acting performance in this movie. Because it's guys who post for the film she's been overlooked because no man can relate to how anti-female this woman is and how far from the real Helena. Women who can treat random sex and despicable grunge as a natural and casual form of life have gone off the path somewhere and this girl isn't looking for redemption. She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here. So much so that she sinks into the movie like a dead body into a sewer and has been ignored on these boards thus far.
adammartin-71590,"Mar 9, 2021",10/10,"This is the movie you must see before you die. Everything about it is bonkers. Very original. Don't expect just another film about fighting there's helluva lot more to it. This is what movies should be, leading you to the unknown of unpredictably.

abum190,"Dec 21, 2006",7/10,"Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment."
NotThatJamesHolmes,"Jun 29, 2000",4/10,"Fight  Club  begins  with  a  promising  half  hour  and  falls  downhill from  there . Edward  Norton  gives  a  brilliant  performance  as  a depressed  office  worker  driven  by  capitalism . He  narrates  the film , guiding  us  through  his  pathetic  and  hopeless  life . I  was immediately  taken  in  by  the  movie's  slick  visual  style , and Norton's  performance  is  especially  convincing . It  is  here  the movie begins  to  crumble . Funny  how  it's  possible  to  pinpoint  the exact moment  when  it  starts  to  turn  sour . It  is  when  Norton  meets Brad Pitt's  character  on  an  airplane . He's  a  neo-facist  who  teaches self-liberation  through  violence . Norton  is  intrigued  and  joins his group  of  recruits  who  act  out  their  rage  by  pounding  on  each other  in  dark  cellars . Once  Norton  moves  in  with  Pitt  the  movie begins  to  pander  and  get  off  track . It  becomes  more  like watching a  very  bloody  remake  of  The  Odd  Couple . I  was  still  hopeful though , until  the  film  self-destructs  with  a  contrived  suprise ending  that's  totally  contradictory  to  many  of  its  earlier  events . The  suprise  endings  of  Magnolia  and  The  Sixth  Sense  worked , because  they  interlocked  with  their  themes , but  the  ending  in Fight  Club  looks  like  it  was  added  on  just  to  give  it  a  kick . Then  there's  the  final  scene ,  which  is  illogical  and  serves only as  a  cop-out , as  the  movie  ducks  responsibility  to  its  real theme , Norton's  unstable  mental  condition . The  material  was  here  for  a compelling  film , but  Fight  Club  never  explores  it . Instead , it falls  into  standard , formulized  Hollywood  mush . Seeing  Fight  Club , I  realized  you  can  have  great  ideas  for  films , but  unless  you use  them  well , and  find  just  the  right  note , great  ideas  do not necessarily  make  great  movies ."
MissCzarChasm,"Apr 15, 2001",10/10,"When Fight Club was released to theatres i refused to go see it. The previews made it look like it was movie purely about senseless violence without a point or a message. One night while at a friends house they were raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't into seeing it but what else could i do. When the movie was over i couldn't believe what i had just saw. All my negative feelings about the movie were put to rest and i realized that i had seen a great movie and now it's in my top 10.I won't go into the plot because i think that the viewer should experience that for himself instead of reading this review. i will however say that it's not all about violence and the violence that is displayed in the film has a reason for being there. it's all about letting out aggression and finding out who you are. The violence is just a small part of a bigger picture.The acting is top notch. Brad pitt is in a lot of my favorite movies(Seven, Interview with the vampire, snatch).He's a very good actor and he jsut has a certain charisma when he's on screen. If anyone hasany doubts about his abilities they should see tihs movie. Edward Norton is also very good in the film. He's a very versatile actor and he fits intot his role very nicely. Helen bohnam carter is very good as the sole female in the film. she can more that handle her own with the 2 male leads. good supporting roles are also give by meat loaf and jared leto. Meat loaf is especially good in his role as bob.The direction by David Fincher is excellent. This film is a little dark like seven but there is more of a visual flair in this film. he's a brilant director and he has a eye for what's good in a film.In closing fight club is a movie we all should see and hope everyone gets a chance to see it."

I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the cliches but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time On Line and get to the nearest video store!"
Irene212,"Nov 18, 2024",6/10,"It's the late 90s. Gen Xers are dissatisfied. The Narrator (Edward Norton) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) release their pent-up rage in bare-knuckle fighting, then create 'fight clubs' for their peers. ""We've all been raised to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't,"" Tyler incites the recruits. ""We're a generation of men raised by women.""Well, yes, that is what mothers do... but Tyler isn't recruiting geniuses. Feckless young white men respond in numbers, eager to prove their potency with bare knuckles and a safe word (a phrase coined in 1979, so this is Gen X to the core). The clubs grow, satisfying Tyler's true ambition: Project Mayhem, turning the mindless fight club members into domestic terrorists.It's a dark satire, highlighted by crisp and amusing arguments between the disheartened Narrator and despotic Tyler. Early on, support groups are lampooned, including one for testicular cancer attended by a female imposter ('imposter syndrome' dates to 1978), who becomes the movie's obligatory hot girl (Helena Bonham Carter). Black humor peaks with Tyler's bungled burglary at a liposuction clinic, stealing bags of human fat to be used to make soap and explosives, and his chemistry lesson is a treat, if you overlook The Narrator's ignorance. And there is a grimly derisive Orwellian scene following the death of a Project Mayhem terrorist (Meat Loaf).Bottom line, though: The violence is just one element of a visually unpleasant movie, and an overly long one. Bonham Carter's character is part of the problem. She adds nothing but more confusion to a plot that manages to be puzzling without being suspenseful. I was bored long before the big reveal at the end, and after it I was disappointed."
kazybekovaayazhan,"Oct 15, 2019",10/10,"I, initially , was not quite big fan of these kind of deeply meaningful movies , may be to the reason that I could not fully understand them. Nevertheless, directed by David Fincher, the""fight club"" became one of my most preferable movies of all time. The promise that was taken by film was more vital that it firstly seems as. The plot reveals the life of depressed man Edward Norton, who searches for peace in different type of clubs which are based on meetings sick people. A little time later, he faced an individual after whom his life had changed.
Under the direction of phenomenal producer , all the way of the film was interesting to watch. The breathtaking scenes and thrilling phrases that are directly connected with the contemporary world, which made a tremendous impact on my view to everything. Nevertheless, the movie is not easily accessible to community, due to the reason that not of all part of society are really understanding the position of director. I personally did the same at the beginning. After the passage of several time I managed my time to rewatch the movie, and felt an opportunity to comprehend my lifestyle.
To recapitulate, this is the most influentials movie which has powerful meaning in the background( even bizarre) that Fincher had ever filmed. I strongly recommend to watch it until the very end."
smcindy,"Nov 2, 2019",10/10,"This movie is amazing.
I still can't stop thinking about it."
Dropoutbear,"Jul 16, 2021",10/10,"In Nietzsche's philosophy, there are three states of the human mind: the camel, the lion and the baby. The first state camel, endure humiliation, passively obedient to the arrangement of others or fate; The second realm of lion is to change passivity into initiative, from""you should""to""I want"". I will take the initiative to fight for everything and take the responsibility of life. Third state baby, this is an ""I am"" state, living in the moment and enjoying the present.In the US in the 1990s, the domestic economy boomed, giving rise to a surge of middle-class consumerism. What is consumerism? Life goals are closely related to the acquisition of goods, even if those goods are not needed for survival or for the traditional purpose of showing off. In consumerism, people are obsessed with the process of acquiring goods as the basis of their identity. The social system also serves for consumerism, such as designers who are specially responsible for enhancing the attractiveness of goods and ubiquitous advertisements, etc. The biggest spiritual shackles of consumerism lies in this. The process of acquiring goods has become the basis of people's identity.Jack is such a consumerist. He worked in order to make money, and to make money in order to buy more and better material, goods became the purpose of Jack. Jack did the same boring work every day, and his boss was bleeding him. Jack is portrayed as a consumer in a society where consumerism is prevalent, and he is caught in the trap of consumerism, in the cycle of work and consumption. He is a prisoner of the spirit, unable to feel his own worth, unable to feel the vitality of life. He began to lose sleep, and he began to look for a way out of his pain.Jack is a submissive camel enslaved by the material and system, while Tyler is a lion who dares to fight against material society, opposes all rules and advocates spiritual freedom. When Jack met Tyler, fight club was born. Fight makes people devote themselves to it and release their wildness. The pain brought by fight makes people feel their own existence, makes people temporarily break away from the cycle of work and consumption, and makes people throw away all the troubles and discomforts of life. This method is popular with many people and more and more people join fight club. Taylor yearns for a world that reverts to a primal time of instinct, and Taylor still becomes an extremist. Taylor wanted to liberate mankind from modern material and institutional civilization, and he did it by destroying it. But this is not desirable. Although we are constrained by the social value system and rules of modern civilization, they also bring us social order and progress. Although the social value system and rules of modern civilization shackle part of our nature and become the shackles of our spirit, they guarantee the higher efficiency of social operation and the guarantee of our high standard of living. So it is not feasible to throw away material and system completely. So the lion evolved into a baby, and Jack killed Taylor. The baby represents a new birth, re-establishing its own worth and will.In the beginning, we are tamed as a camel, taught what values are and told what to do. Then we began to question and reflect, becoming lions of confrontation and destruction. Eventually we become babies, abandoning our old values and rules and perceiving the world all over again, reevaluating everything we come into contact with. Jack eliminated the split personality of Tyler, brought himself to a state of harmony, reached the infant state. Newborn babies have the will to choose actively, no longer blindly pursue the value defined by the external world, feel their inner world, redefine and create their own value, and achieve spiritual freedom."
dbdumonteil,"Sep 27, 2001",10/10,"What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course ""Dr Jekill and Mister Hide"" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,""a clockwork orange"" ,""rebel without a cause"" ""bad influence"" and Joel Schumacher's ""falling down"",the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in ""primal fear"".Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says ""the things you...""The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,à la ""sixth sense"" ,""Jacob's ladder"" or"" Usual suspects"" ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of ""clues"":the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.The last picture seems now terrifying."
Sergeant_Tibbs,"Feb 15, 2007",10/10,"From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10/10"
valerianodellalonga,"May 17, 2021",10/10,"One of the best and most original movies ever done.Never cease to amaze even when watched for the 20th time.Theaters should play this again, for the new generations to fully experience it."
robnax11,"Mar 10, 2016",10/10,"Fight club is a movie by David Fincher and star Edward Norton as...well, its not clear but he's called the narrator and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. It stars with with the last act of the film but then takes us back to the star. We see the Narrator and he tell us about how he has insomnia which has taken a toll on his mentality making him look lifeless and tired. He works for an automotive company with means he has to travel all the time and record wrecked cars from accidents. On one of his travels he mets Tyler Durden, a free spirited guy with a disdain for consumerism and confirmative society. He's views and ideas are appealing to the Narrator and circumstances lead them to live together. After a short time, they started a club where men from different walks of life can join and in this club, members fight each other one on one till one surrenders. Firstly, I would like to say that is one of the best story in film. The script is one the smartest I've ever seen. The first act feels like a dream like world with The Narrator's smooth, simple description of the events of his life. Personally, I could related very well to him, during the time in which I first saw the movie, I was in the midst of an insomniac phase similar to the Narrator. I watched the movie movie with some of my friends and saw them getting lost as the movie progresses. They were expecting some brain dead action flick that has Brad Pitt in it. All of them dose of eventually while I was left glued to the spectacle of events that transitions in the movie. Tyler Durden, Brad's character is such a memorable guy that makes him seem larger than live. The lines in he delivers are absolutely brilliant and make you question the norms of life and exactly how absurd they really are for example "" We're consumers. We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession "". His view's made us question our life goals and how much of what we do is just society telling us we should do. This is the power of this movie. And when I said earlier that it's not a brainless action movie that doesn't this movie is a bore fess. Its a very intriguing with mixture of action, psychological thriller, comedy(the humor is frequent and well done) and mystery. There are a few questions I had that were answered at the end. Overall, this movie is deserving of the people's praises and cemented David Fincher as a brilliant, unique director who brings a tone and look to this film which complements the story well. The movie cinematography looks awesome and I couldn't believe it came out in 1099 it look more like a 2010's movie. Fight club is one of my all time favorite movie and I highly recommend you see it."
MrskiViletic,"Oct 21, 2020",10/10,"David Fincher's masterpiece is the best film school you can find out there. It is a milestone of cinema in every aspect. The shot composition, the framing, the editing, pacing, the production design, camera work, everything is top notch and creatively executed. The performances of the complete cast are carrier defining and the characters they are portraying are already legendary in cinema history. It is highly entertaining, rewatchable and just a fun experience throughout its running time. A truly remarkable film which left a huge imprint and influence on cinema."
dakuchonekobing,"Jun 21, 2025",6/10,"David Fincher's films always have detective elements and also have frames with many details. Fight Club is no exception. I have seen several of this director's movies, and although I am impressed with the way the frames are arranged with a lot of information, the story of Fight Club is like other David's movies, very lacking in emotion. From beginning to end, we see interesting things happening but not much emotion. I quite liked the first 20 minutes when the main character's story brought surprising excitement, but the next hour and a half of development did not meet my expectations, although the acting of Brad Pitt and Helena were both commendable. In the end, when everything was revealed, all curiosity was answered, the story was no longer attractive. Maybe I am not a fan of David or WWE, but this movie does not deserve the praise of many people. It is overrated."
daveisit,"Dec 13, 2000",4/10,"Well it was a nice story, and so realistic. I'm sure most normal humans are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in ""Fight Club"".Surely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting. Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes. I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.It was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in ""Legends of the Fall"", nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even though the boy has talent.I feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as opposed to a realistic society pastime."
gallardoknight,"Jul 3, 2016",10/10,"Not much to say without fear of spoiling anything, but without a doubt one of the best pieces of film and one of Finchers finest. A true satire of not only American sub culture, but also a satire about how we live and breathe with the constant advertisements, merchandise, commercialization and overall materialistic points of view that inherit much our lives. A true gritty film about freeing oneself from all things and life and finding yourself in a world with fear. Elements of humor, truth, frightening realism and dark satire, Fight Club delivers on all parts to deliver a truly untouchable film that dares to ""go there"" and never apologize for it."

Honestly can't say anything about this absolute masterpiece just watch it a couple of times at least twice and if you don't get the poing that's not the movie's fault sorry dude but your just not bright enough or don't want to understand what it says."

richardpickard-69373,"Sep 3, 2020",5/10,"So there is a twist in this film
It's a similar twist which has been done in other films better.
The film was ok.
It did not particularly hold my attention.
Quite why it has such a high score is bizarre.
Maybe it's the combination of brad Pitt plus plot twist.
But really if you look at other films with similar scores in my view this film does not deserve to have a score above 8 at best."
mrlore473,"Sep 26, 2015",10/10,"We follow the narrator, played by Edward Norton, as he struggles with insomnia and the lack of meaning in his life. Fight Club was directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. It's a Dark Comedy which explores the ironies of our society, Fincher holds a mirror in our face show how disgusting we are and then he makes us laugh at this. This movie is masterfully directed and edited, beautifully filmed and decorated, it features some of the best performances by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. It is hard to understand what people didn't see when it came out, even though the magic was a bit lost when this movie became so popular, that now holds the tenth spot in the IMDb's Top 250, in my opinion it deserves this status, if not to compensate the hate or indifference it received when it came out then for its achievements as a stupendously well done movie. It deserves a 10 in my view. Would recommend to any person who wants to think a bit about life or/and wants to watch a great movie."
xapikem,"Dec 7, 2021",10/10,"Fight Club is an underground fighting club for men only. Founded by Tyler Durden and The Narrator, it is a forum where men of all different social standings from all different professions are able to strip off their labels and love each other as equals. The Narrator replaces his support group addiction with Fight Club, as he finds it far more therapeutic and genuine. Fight Club morphs into Project Mayhem, and eventually all fighting stops in favor of soap/explosives manufacture and training."

dierregi,"Jul 18, 2024",7/10,"It's a challenge to say something new about a cult classic like ""Fight Club,"" but here goes: after all these years, the story seems to have lost some of its punch. The film, which once felt groundbreaking and audacious, now reveals itself as inconsistent and repetitive.Edward Norton plays the anonymous ""Narrator,"" a man so revolted by consumerism that he channels his frustration into rage, because, you know, being male and self-centered, what else can he do? He starts attending support groups to vent his feelings, only to have his emotional outlet spoiled by the arrival of Marla, another ""tourist"" in the world of misery.Then, during a business trip, he meets Tyler Durden, who has a ""briefcase exactly like his"" (wink, wink). They start a ""fight club,"" where disaffected men gather to beat each other senseless. Sure, it's a healthier alternative to domestic violence, which remains inexplicably popular. After plenty of bruises and a descent into squalor, things escalate with Project Mayhem, a ludicrous plan to obliterate consumer society and return us to a prehistoric paradise, because life was just grand back then.Norton's Narrator is suitably neurotic and deranged, while Brad Pitt's Tyler is the charismatic, nihilistic antihero we all secretly wish we could be (minus the nihilism and the fighting, of course).That's the gist, delivered with exceptional visual flair and style. I loved the film on my first watch, but subsequent viewings made me realize how underdeveloped and catty the Marla character is (with Helena Bonham Carter being completely miscast) and how absolutely impossible some scenes are (Tyler extracting the Narrator from the car? WTF). Also, it seems this was the peak of David Fincher's career, which has been on a steady decline since. Similarly, Chuck Palahniuk found his niche audience but never quite hit the mainstream jackpot again.Instead of a bang, it's seems that for Fincher and Palahniuk it's a slow and endless whimper."
zqbwcxs,"Jul 8, 2021",10/10,"When I was just a little jit, I used to show up at home with random scrapes and bruises. Turns out some guy named Tyler Durdin was beating me unconscious every day!"
Ultimate_Bad-Ass,"Apr 5, 2016",10/10,"but the same worthless piece of writing written by a person's organ just as everybody's else. The movie revolves around a man 'The Narrator' (Edward Norton) who is bored from his life joins a group where people share their feelings, there he meets an annoying girl who plays an important role in the movie named Marla Singer, then he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), initiates a group named Fight Club where people fight with each other and commit crimes in the city. It changes his life but he gets embroiled in relationship with him. The movie is divided into 2 halves. One that develops the character of 'The Narrator' throwing light on his boring (for him) yet interesting and relatable life (for us). The other part of the movie is psychologically thrilling. The 'thrilling' part of the movie is insanely effective. It can change one's perspective towards life for an hour at least, although that is very short period of time but you would see the world from a much better perspective. In that part of the movie, 'The Narrator' fights with his own philosophy to make the moral choice (stop the chaos in the city). The characters are one the coolest characters of all time. They are inspiring, cool and relatable especially Tyler Durden. The Narrator is an antisocial insomniac, critical thinker. He pays attention to almost everything surrounding him. He uses scientific terms and complex words while framing sentences so as to appear clever. He is bored from repeating his everyday life. He lacks friends and family. The 1st part of the movie is great because it's interesting, it's relatable and the narrator narrates it in his lovely emotionless voice, with humour and sarcasm at times. Tyler Durden is also an anti socialist who have radical methods to spread his philosophy i.e renunciation of modern society, facing pain and death as major part of the life. He hates the fact that people are bound with the laws of sociality & government and cannot do their will. He is like a teacher. He wants people to do what they want to. He does not like all those boring stuffs people do such as watching flashes of pictures bring projected on T.V. You must have got the idea. He initiates Fight Club where people fight to experience physical pain, not to win so as to get people out of stupid socialism. The ideas of spreading ideas through violence may sound idiotic but is beyond awesomeness because it is only when you are tortured that you would reveal your true reaction to something. You wouldn't be afraid to do anything. You wouldn't be shy to remove your pants and when you will adapt to pain, there would be nothing in the world that could frighten you. Tyler Durden is not afraid of anything, he cannot be tortured. That's what Tyler Durden makes of The Narrator. He makes him beat himself ruthlessly without the fear of pain. Both are each other's best friends. Tyler Durden does a lot of things to make the narrator what he wants him to become. He successfully does it to the members of Fight Club but it was quite a challenge for The Narrator. That part of the movie begins when 2nd half starts. The 2nd half of the movie is psychologically thrilling. Although it is one of the best psychological thrillers but since the 1st half of the movie was completely drama, it is not considered a thriller film by IMDb or Google. The scenes of the 2nd half are quite intense, insane, inspiring and disturbing. The background soundtrack played during those scenes are mysterious, noisy representing chaos and confusion. That's why it received Oscar nominations for that category. Sometimes , there is no background soundtrack at all, it's just the solid acting and intense emotions that dominate those scenes. The Narrator, then begins narrating with confusion with all the chaos going on. There's always a psychological atmosphere maintained in that half. It have aspects of neo-noir movies but is not actually one of them.Then comes the plot-twist. If you have googled Fight Club you must be familiar that it is also known for its mind blowing plot twist. Unlike other movies, this one continues even after the plot twist and The Narrator becomes more connected to the audience and the movie becomes even more mind-fuzzing. It's like The Sixth Sense running even after the plot twist. There are tons of hint. In fact the whole movie is the hint. You would never be able to spot all the hints or predict the plot twist. After typing ""hints for Fight Club's plot twist"" (don't do that if you haven't seen it) you would realize that this is one of the most clever movies ever made. Marla Singer is the girl in Fight Club. Although, she may not seem important but she plays a very important role in the movie. It is difficult to understand her, from that statement I am not referring to what people say for girls nowadays, Marla Singer is just weird. She is not afraid of death, she is also anti social and talks weird things. The plot twist could have been even more mind blowing if it included her. Fight Club is actually a moral movie in its own dark way. Dark morality is a much better term for example Joker's quote (The Dark Knight). Some people didn't liked the movie. Some people hated the very idea of the movie, that's the reason why Academy Awards didn't liked it. However David Fincher will never be able to make a better movie, neither will Church Palahniuk ever write a better novel. They both made a masterpiece. Directing skills, screenplay, writing and acting is great too. ^- I am Jack's honest review."
Vixenamour,"Apr 12, 2016",10/10,"I totally #Loved# this movie from beginning, ALL the way up until it's unforeseen - & twisty end - An instant classic. So much so, it has been inducted onto very, short list of mine. Short, only because it is rarest of films. The kind that I don't mind watching over and over. (Why waste such precious time, when I have so many other films I want to watch/discover?)I should also mention a totally unabashed guilty pleasure of mine that happens only with this film. I admit. I am utterly compelled to hit *pause* so that I may take in one of the most captivating, memorable images of Brad Pitt's ethereal beauty.I most certainly should make note of one more thing before I wrap up my ramble. #Applause To Whomever performed the casting for this wonderful gem, as well. Not just only because one of my favourite actresses, Helena Bonham Carter, was cast as the films lead protagonist. A role to which Helena obviously totally immersed herself into it's character. Especially since she almost became unrecognizable to me, in a good way, I second guessed myself throughout the movie. Only at the end of the film, during the scroll of the credits, was I made totally certain that it was indeed Helena. Meatloaf also is worth mentioning, for the role of 'Bob', needs giant kudos as well. Meatloaf is captivating in his performance of the most tortured of characters named 'Bob' which is brilliant and totally unforgettable. And of course, this movie is where I was properly introduced to Ed Norton, as an actor. Thank you Fight Club."
isbackaparichit,"Jan 30, 2021",10/10,Changed my perspective of veiwing life and and definitly got aware of myself. Totally unexpected movie but it is one of the most important movies i have ever seen. Glad to watch it.
DanielFilipeR,"Mar 9, 2016",10/10,"This Movie it's just great! One of the films which EVERYONE has the obligation to see. The critic to the consumerism in our society in it it's so deep and intense and it tell us that in great dialogs. And of course, it's the best David Fincher's movie ever directed with great performances by an brilliant cast. Again. everyone has to see it. We actually feel the frustration of the character with this world. We believe that our lives will be great and awesome but that ain't going to happen. And this movie shows us that fact. It opens our eyes to where we're living and it makes us doubt if we are indeed living. Again, the way that this movie tells us not to be dependent of what we have and to be prepare that our lives ain't going to be that great but still we can make a difference, it's great. We do have a lot of potential. Just like this movie. So, let's live like we really should. But first, watch this movie."
stojanovicanastasija,"Jul 2, 2019",9/10,Movie that leaves you questioning reality; definitely should watch!

faikyilmaaz,"Nov 24, 2024",10/10,"If you've spent any time on social media, you've probably come across motivational videos filled with powerful quotes. And if you look closely, you'll realize that some of those iconic lines actually come from Fight Club. :) This film has been a source of motivation and inspiration for so many people, and I'm no exception.For me, Fight Club isn't just a movie; it's a wake-up call. It challenges the way we think about our lives, our priorities, and even our identity. The raw energy, the mind-bending twists, and the brutally honest dialogue make it unforgettable. It's the kind of film that stays with you long after the credits roll, making you question everything you thought you knew.I couldn't let the opportunity to comment pass by without acknowledging how much this film has inspired me. If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor-it's not just a movie; it's an experience."

nasro-84876,"Sep 2, 2023",10/10,"This movie is masterpiece from the beginning to the ending. There are many wonderful events with legendary characters, led by Tyler Durden, who played by brad pitt that did a amazing preforming . It contains unexpected events, a wonderful story, and expressive lessons and values. Truly the best movie I have ever seen in my life The film is deeper than just a fight club, but it delves into various things and meanings that lead us to wonderful events. The ending is never forgotten in this film, which raises the bar for other films to do something innovative like this.Acting, directing, writing, narrative and photography are very wonderful
I strongly recommend watching it."
miheela,"Mar 24, 2016",10/10,"Like all very good movies, I was also postponing this one. My mom told me I would not understand it and it's not suitable for me at all. But.. I did watch it. I was amazed. I had to watch it again next day to absorb everything, every thought. I loved the movie, I loved the cast and every second of it. I still do and I am always happy to watch it again or recommend to my friends. Edward Norton as the main character is a normal guy with a normal job, but he lives very normal life - boring, without any adventure. He'll meet that guy Tyler (Brad Pitt) and everything will change. That's where the fun starts. I'm recommending to anyone who is still deciding."
hamidrezagfr,"Feb 18, 2024",10/10,"We cannot deny the quality of 90's cinema. Everyone who is seeking a meaningful and breathtaking movie can watch it. Not only the movie stories are perfect but also the actors are stars who were never born again like Pitt, Tom Cruise etc. Club Fight is an art that is not related to the time so you can watch it whenever you want. The story is strong and unpredictable. At first, you think it is a regular movie but when you know the characters you can not move in front of the TV. In my view, Fight Club is a fact that everyone can experience it so we can understand it completely. This is the reason that makes it outstanding. I believe if you are interested in psychological movies, you must watch it now then."
RokuShi,"Mar 18, 2024",10/10,"The movie talks about how we should give up on the new world because it has obscured reality with the luxuries we have to chase after. The fight club was created to help modern men return to primitive man doing the things that men did, should and will do. That is violence, that is not a proof to become a man, but violence makes a man. Violence helps release this new world that holds us back and forces us to be peaceful. When doing the first exercise, people tend to avoid violence, so exercise number 1 is difficult to complete. Tyler's goal is to return society to the old world, the primitive world. See the world through our own eyes, not through the eyes of others. The world enslaves us with frivolous, annoying, time-wasting things that we don't really enjoy every moment of. If we enjoy, no moment is wasted. No matter whether the old world was good or not, this world is not. How much can you know about yourself if you have never been a fight?"
Movie-Man-Bob,"Oct 2, 2003",N/A,"WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW.I saw Fight Club a month or two back, and was kind of unimpressed with it. It was a decently made film, with good acting and good directing... but something about it just didn't quite work for me. That is until I began to examine it more closely. Then I realized what it really is: It's not a life-altering drama or a vicious black comedy, as it is proclaimed to be... rather, it is a cleverly disguised attempt to bring one of the greatest comic strips of all time to the big screen.That's right, Fight Club is really an adaptation of Calvin and Hobbes. Just take a look at the similarities...Fight Club: The Narrator (hereinafter ""Jack"") feels depressed and alone, which leads to his fabricating Tyler Durden, a friend and companion who is everything Jack wishes he could be.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin has no friends, which leads to his projecting everything he wishes he could be into his stuffed tiger, who becomes his friend and companion Hobbes.Fight Club: When Jack looks at Tyler, he sees Tyler. When anyone else looks at Tyler, they see Jack.Calvin and Hobbes: When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a tiger. When anyone else looks at Hobbes, they see a stuffed toy.Fight Club: Jack simultaneously detests Marla and desires her. He projects his desire through Tyler, though in several scenes we see this desire in Jack himself.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin simultaneously detests Susie and desires her. Throughout the course of the strip, we see this desire manifested in Hobbes. But in the very early episodes, Calvin expresses the same desire himself, if only to himself.Fight Club: Jack expresses his dissatisfaction with his father, and the job he did as a parent.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin frequently speaks of his father doing poorly in the ""polls"".Fight Club: While at work, Jack is under the thumb of a demanding boss, whom he does not like.Calvin and Hobbes: While at school, Calvin is under the thumb of Miss Wormwood, a demanding teacher whom he does not like.Fight Club: When frustrated with the world around him, Jack goes to a place in his imagination (that place with the penguin) where all around him things are serene.Calvin and Hobbes: When frustrated with the world around him, Calvin goes to places in his imagination, where he is Spaceman Spiff, Tracer Bullet, Stupendous Man, etc.So, thus we see that, though Bill Waterson himself forbad the filming of his strip, a few brave men had the courage to go behind his back and do what they felt was right. Never has there been such a courageous act by filmmakers since the days of Nosferatu, which was another thinly-disguised attempt to bring a beloved character to the screen... Count Chocula."
simonarazm-02295,"Mar 21, 2016",10/10,"This movie is so incredibly amazing, that even spoiling the smallest thing would ruin the experience.The characters are well written and the overall plot is incredibly well paced. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton's performance elevate the movie up to astronomical heights, due to incredible chemistry and extremely well acted pivotal scenes.The ending will melt your brain, as well as the midsection. There's only one negative thing about this movie:You'll never find anything like this, and therefore make your life meaningless.You'll scour the web looking for top ten lists of movies like Fight Club, and there is virtually none.You'll watch this movie, and come out with a strong taste for more.But there's none to be had. I recommend you go buy the movie asap, and watch this master piece, and from there, loose your perception of your meaning on this planet!"

lunadimitri,"Mar 18, 2016",10/10,"Wow, if you haven't already seen this movie... get to it! When i first heard about this movie,I had no idea what it was about, a few years ago i had finally rented it, and boy was i in for a treat. Starting off, the narrator in fight club was such a brilliant piece, giving the audience someone to relate to, and giving the narrator someone to lay his thought out besides himself. The narrator then meets tyler durden,and they quickly become business partners in a meeting the created called fights club, now i cant say much, due to the first rule about fight club, but i can say, if you choose to watch, you wont be disappointed"

khaled_arafa,"May 8, 2023",10/10,"This movie was years ahead of its time and as it's approaching its 24th anniversary, it's still relevant, still on point.Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride.For more than 20 years, the film has also been praised for its innovative storytelling, powerful performances, and thought-provoking themes.An outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload.It's a movie that doesn't offer answers but provokes your senses, instincts and thinking to look for them in every aspect of your life.A movie you never get bored watching and enjoy lip syncing its lines.A must watch."
Jakemcclake,"Feb 21, 2013",7/10,"This movie has been hailed by many (mostly men) as the greatest movie of all time. It has been continually rising up the ""Top 250"" and now ranks as the 10th best on IMDb.I'm sorry, after 4 viewings, I still do not get to that level. I don't think I ever will.I have read many of the reviews and I agree with most of the positive comments and do not agree at all with most of the negative reviews. The movie is not dumb by any means. It is not an experience in testosterone driven world of violence. It is anything but a mess.It is a very well written, extremely well directed, view into a dark anti-consumerism world.The movie's message is recognize consumerism and reject consumerism. As such, it presents the conflict between two characters Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and someone who is called Jack, Rupert or Cornelius and who is played by Edward Norton.Jack is quite a consumer, or at least at the start of the movie he is. There is also Marla Singer played by (Helena Bonham Carter), who is both like Tyler in most ways and like Jack in other ways.Tyler is basically against everything society values, and virtually anything positive. He argues with, and eventually begins to win Jack over to his thinking. At one point, he fights Jack and the two of them create fight club. Tyler also has a sexual relationship with Marla, despite the fact that his friend Jack can't stand to be around her.The movie has a good and memorable twist. The movie is loaded with numerous unique and memorable quotes. Most of the quotes are very negative. The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.If we desperately needed a movie against consumerism: this is it! Here is one of the quotes:""You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.""If we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way,This is not it,andThis is anything but it.Here is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than once:""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.""Here is another line that someone shouts:""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.""If you like dark negative movies, this is a good one. If you want to be uplifted, this is not your movie, it's Jack Movie as the DVD tells you."
arklier,"Sep 5, 2006",1/10,"I went to see this with a friend because I'd heard 'it was good' at the local IMAX theater, no less. I went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever. Once I actually saw it, I realized it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some real stinkers. I'd rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back Ed Wood marathon.I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about Fight Club. What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.The secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.I could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.Is Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth? The cinematography is choppy, and there's only so much I can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason.They should have used some of that soap to clean up the film.From me, 1 star."

barismeral,"Nov 24, 2019",10/10,Every minute of the movie is beautiful. one of the only films that can be watched without being bored. A movie that can be played back multiple times is really amazing.
HotTakesAndMilkshakes,"Oct 4, 2021",8/10,"This movie still , in 2021 proves it stands the test of time. It is a movie that is very unique , even today.Deeper meaning and message of the movie is what makes it a cult classic but also a ""study""The acting and directing is just eye candy. David Fincher has a unique style that just fits with kind of a movie.In the most basic sence , this movie is a fight against a cruise control life . It mocks the life most of us live , it mocks the society will live in and it is scary just how relatable this movie still is and will be for years to come.However , this movie is still not a 10/10 for me and here is why.This movie succeeds most of the time to deliver the message and make you think about a deeper meaning but sometimes it gets overcomplicated with delivering those magic words. It feels too much like a book and that creates a slow pace with too many words. The movie has some parts that could easily be erased but the twist at the end makes it seem worth it but ...
by the end it gets a little too detached from the basic message and what it is actually trying to say that you quickly lose focus.I think the movie is and wil always be a cult classic masterpiece but the premise of the movie could have been better done like Parasite. It has a deeper meaning and important message like this movie but the delivery is just better made in my opinion.In my opinion Seven is a better Fincher movie.8/10

icybluesx,"Feb 22, 2016",10/10,"I think the plot twist is very particular, it's a kind of movie that plays with your brain, it gives you joy and also sadness, i don't know if i can describe everything you feel while you're watching it, for me it's very important how you're feeling through the movie, and i love it when i can be laughing at something and then feel terrible about a character. For me, it was easy to get attracted to Norton's character, really simple and mundane, nothing special. I've not read the book yet, probably i will do it someday, but i know a book cannot be compared to a movie, they're different but i'm sure they have the same essence. I know it's easy to find movies like this, i watched recently ""the revenant"" and it gave me a similar feeling, i was up, and then was down, i was happy, but then concerned, movies are feelings, not just shots or frames or if it has a good photography, it helps of course, but as a screenwriter, i'd like to think about the screenplay and characters more than anything else."
KCErdem,"Mar 12, 2016",10/10,"I watched this movie for 10 times. This is excellent. This movie is best. Watch before die because you find too many thing from world and from yourself. Some people say ""Fight Club ? It is nice."". No no no. This movie needs better words like ""Perfect"" like ""Impossible"". Watch this movie anyway.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999."
zurdulla,"Jan 3, 2020",10/10,A real brain explosion. Fight Club is the best in its genre. The film shows a sense of deja vu well. Young Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are gorgeous. Unusual script. Amazing and memorable soundtrack.
vovhunden,"Aug 17, 2002",1/10,"In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: ""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression."" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.The main character continues: ""We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't"".Well, learning to differentiate between yourself and ""movie gods [and] rock stars"" and learning that life is not all beer and skittles is what growing up is about today.So, Brad Pitt et al., grow up. And go read a book or something.The rubbish quote sums it up pretty good: ""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men that have ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas or waiting tables; slaves with white collars. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don't need. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off. """

mattlx,"Aug 8, 2023",10/10,"Edward Norton's performance as the unnamed narrator is a highlight, capturing the character's emotional turmoil and gradual descent into chaos. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Tyler Durden is enigmatic and captivating, embodying both charisma and a darker philosophy.The dynamic between the two characters represents a psychological duality, with Tyler as the embodiment of the narrator's repressed desires and frustrations.""Fight Club"" left a significant impact on popular culture, influencing discussions on masculinity, consumerism, and the quest for meaning in a postmodern world. The film's memorable quotes, such as ""The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club,"" have become part of the cultural lexicon."
jjtrain-82225,"Apr 18, 2023",10/10,"I've been told so many times to watch this movie. Finally, I've watched it and I just don't know where to begin. This movie is absolutely amazing in about every way. You never expect the ending or the plot twists as you keep trying to predict what is going to eventually happen. It takes you on such a good journey of the development of the MC and it gets more interesting as you go further. Sure, the beginning was slow and boring some people have said but it was worth the entire movie. The building point just leaves you blown away, in my experience. I love how everything has been left up to the viewer's interpretation, you connect the dots and you can create your own interpretations of the ending and overall the entire meaning of the message being portrayed. This movie was an eye opener and it has done its job beautifully. Feels like throughout this movie I started second guessing myself, I got pretty confused at some points, and then later the movie %100 satisfied the confusion I had. This movie deserves the hype that it has, it truly is an amazing watch. It was naturally funny, dramatic, motivating, eye opening and definitely gore filled. The cinematography was very well done, the actors gave a great performance, and the climax was great. Feels like I'll never see a movie that could be as great as this movie did with its plot. Fight Club makes you want to change your view or perspective on things and in life in general. It focused on corporate issues, materialism, the modern slavery of man kind today and much more. Fight Club makes you want to get up and fight just to feel excitement in any miserable experience you had or going through. I will definitely rewatch this movie and I feel like the second rewatch will be even better as I recognize all the hints and connect even more dots than the first watch. A genius made this concept and executed it perfectly, nothing can really change my mind about this movie. I loved it, 11/10 I recommend if you are not sensitive to the very graphic content of gore in this movie."
gustav193,"Mar 27, 2016",10/10,"This is my first review so don't expect much.First of all I have to say, this movie was a life-changing experience for me. I started looking things at different perspective and started seeing things for what they really are.The importance of this movie is of a very high order for all ages of viewers. I think the film is wildly inventive and i'm not denying that it's controversial. But the cast is exceptional and the directing on this is amazing. There's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel student pub debates for years. Which as a student myself can relate.One of my all-time favorites."
MadReviewer,"May 14, 2001",6/10,"Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.The film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing young man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog.  To alleviate his misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings for depressed people.  Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors, drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the Narrator starts to feel better about his own life.  It's perverse and macabre, but it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club' really shines.Unfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets two people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and depression of being forced to live a homogenized life.  Durden's solution to this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap out of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.As Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply awesome in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt, as Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that it at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept, and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp.  What was a clever movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's where `Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger plans just bring the film to a grinding halt.Part of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions. However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead seems to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it. Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the point of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to be. Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need.  There's a certain irony to `Fight Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.Without giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end of `Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In `Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced, and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have relied on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to fall back on, this gimmick usually backfires.  It definitely backfires in `Fight Club'.`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a great film.  Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film with a garbled message.  Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this film - it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much better. `Fight Club' is forgettable. Grade: C+"
mrafayel,"Aug 13, 2020",10/10,"This movie has got the meaning: deep meaning. It has got scenario, with mindblowing plot twists. The conversations are great. There could be no better actors' trio. The acting is great. This movie is motivational and calming at the same time. If you're watching a David Fincher movie, there's no way it's not one if the best movies ever created. This is THE BEST MOVIE EVER."
pyaesonekyawchk,"May 4, 2021",9/10,"This movie based on what world is happening whithin your a single blink. Within a single blink you can do whatever you can in your own imagination. We live in a society where people doing the same thing, wishing to become impossible things. We are living and doing as a servent of time. The only way to break this society is to do whatever we want over the rule we've given. This film got amzing point."
support-42951,"May 13, 2023",10/10,"The brilliance of Fight Club lies in its ability to deconstruct societal norms and challenge the audience's perception of identity, consumerism, and mental health. The film follows an unnamed narrator (played by Edward Norton), a disillusioned and insomniac office worker who finds an unlikely escape through an underground fight club led by the enigmatic Tyler Durden (portrayed flawlessly by Brad Pitt). Together, they embark on a reckless journey that blurs the boundaries between reality and imagination.Fight Club delves deep into the themes of masculinity, existentialism, and rebellion against a soulless society. It presents a scathing critique of consumer culture, urging viewers to question their own values and choices. The film's visual style is captivating, with Fincher's meticulous direction and the striking cinematography emphasizing the gritty and raw nature of the story.One of the film's greatest strengths is its exceptional performances. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt deliver career-defining performances, showcasing their incredible range and chemistry. Their characters' intense dynamics create a sense of urgency and unpredictability that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Fight Club boasts a legendary twist that has become a staple in pop culture. It challenges viewers to reevaluate everything they thought they knew about the narrative, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll."
A_Cinephile_,"Aug 14, 2020",10/10,"At first I thought it is just another action film. But my god do I have to say it literally blew mind mind. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in their career best as well as David Fincher.
If you love films this is the one you'd never want to miss."
Ashrith26,"Apr 14, 2021",10/10,"This movie isn't just about acting or story or narration and not even the mind blowing twist that you'll ever see. It has something more than this that you need to experience in first hand.It discusses about a lot of interesting topics like consumerism,nihilism,chaos,denying existentialism, how the modern man is becoming more materialistic than spiritual.Well, if these topics don't appeal to you. You will watch it like a normal movie and even though you will like it because of the mind blowing twists that you'll ever see.If you want to experience this movie to the hardcore level, observe every dialogue and try to understand what does it mean. This is one of the rare cases where the movie elevates the book but not the other way around.Brad Pitt's acting is one the highlights of the movie. No one could have done better than him for this character. Unlike many movies like shutter island,predestination where the twist had made the movie better, this isn't the case here. It is already a way better movie but the twist makes it even better.It's no wonder the movie had developed a massive cult following since its release. Fightclub released today would have made more sense than in 1999. Tyler durden would be my one of the favourite characters of all time, both director and brad pitt had done a good job of portraying it."

VeqazZ,"May 15, 2023",10/10,"""Fight Club"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema that offers an extraordinary experience with its unique narrative structure and provocative content. Based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, the film captivates the viewer from start to finish, leaving a lasting impression.Director David Fincher masterfully captures the darkness and chaos of the human mind on screen. The performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliant, and their chemistry is electrifying. Their portrayal of split personalities and the desire to rebel against society's superficial consumerism is compelling and convincing.The plot of ""Fight Club"" is full of unexpected twists and subtle hints that constantly make the viewer reinterpret what is happening. The film encourages contemplation on identity, conformity, and the impact of capitalism, leaving room for various interpretations.The visual style of the film is impressive. The dark atmosphere, powerful compositions, and masterful cinematography enhance the intensity of the story. The film's music, including the iconic soundtrack by The Dust Brothers, contributes to the overall effect and seamlessly integrates with the narrative.""Fight Club"" is a bold, daring, and intelligent film that challenges the conventions of mainstream cinema. It is not for everyone, but for those who embrace its unconventional storytelling, it offers a profound and unforgettable experience. With its outstanding performances, thought-provoking message, and technical brilliance, ""Fight Club"" deserves a rating of 10/10."
Xarx117,"Aug 6, 2022",10/10,"Fight Club is without a doubt one of the most unique movies ever made. Its perspective on society is very accurate in its point of view. Even though anyone could say that its philosophy is partialy wrong and I don't think anybody could argue that it is not. The way it ends is also extremly special in the fact that its hard to tell if its the bad guys or the good guys that won. Its hard for us to know if we are supposed to rule or not for a character like Tyler Durden. The final twist is extremely good and its presented in a very unpredicted way. This movie is like somebody with a mental dissorder. Everything is chaotic, brutal, controversial and suddent. Most of these things are in part because of David Fincher's direction. Its direction is simply flawless, there not a single error in the direction! And it might seem like it is fully flawed when you look on its surface but if you look closer you always find out that it has no error! It has so many things you can talk about and so many easter eggs reffering to the ending which makes it extremely rewatchable. The performances are some of the best cinema has ever seen. Its awesomeness in its puressed form!"
tr91,"Aug 15, 2013",N/A,"Having just watched this film, I honestly can't believe it is ranked in the top 250....let alone in the top 10! Don't get me wrong this film was good but I just can't see why it is rated so highly. If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system.After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best.I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me.7/10."
glassorange,"Apr 19, 2002",7/10,"""Fight Club"" is a very good movie, but it is held up much higher than it deserves to be.  It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this movie ""underappreciated"".  The truth is that it's OVERappreciated.  ""Fight Club"" is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call it.  There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club itself.  The film is pointlessly overlong, with a ridiculous ending that was not at all needed.  So I see no reason why anyone would ever think that this movie was underappreciated.  It's obviously not the case.  However, it is superbly directed, well-written, and well-acted, so I fell good giving it a rating of 7/10."
hikulix,"Nov 6, 1999",1/10,"As an earlier comment stated, the first 2/3rds of this movie are truly intriguing. The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).Edward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.However, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this ""anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched"" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in ""6th sense"", another recent movie, there a ""shocking"" twist near the end. But instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former, here it all seems contrived, forced, it just doesn't fit. All in all, Fight Club is not a bad movie, but I really wished it had ended as good as it started..."
jdebock,"Aug 11, 2022",10/10,"One of the most intriguing movies I've seen. The mental en society side of this movie are insane, especially after a few hours when you rethink some parts of the movie. Easily top 10 movies."

srele-fan,"Jan 4, 2022",10/10,"Great movie, one of the best I have ever seen. It was entertaining from beginning to the end, endless fun. Acting was really good, idea of a movie was great and there was a certain level of complexity to the storyline which I enjoy very much. Ending was also really good, which is really important for me when watching a movie, because I think a bad ending to a movie can change the perception of a movie aftewards."

Kirpianuscus,"Dec 24, 2015",N/A,"more than a good adaptation. or a form of cultural revolution. more than chain of questions about life, its purpose, its direction, solution to every day crisis. a not comfortable exploration of solitude. a parable about the search of happiness and the answers to a too long and deep silence. a film who has as basic virtue the perfect cast. because it is the stage for Brad Pitt to proof not only the talent but the nuances of a character who is too fragile to not become a strange sketch. Edward Norton is the same and the science to transform his character in the perfect picture of ordinary man looking the chance to escape from himself is far to be surprising. a film about power who, more than brilliant adaptation, is a new chapter of the novel."
xmw67,"Sep 23, 2000",1/10,"Although this film was watchable for the first hour or so, it goes very rapidly downhill for the sorry remainder of it's duration. There are simply too many different ideas vying for the viewers attention. Intellectuals have found acres and acres of meaning, which David Fincher wanted them too, although he knows that he has simply made an extremely pretentious and boring mess. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some very good set pieces in the first half of the film that actually entertained me for a while."

Best of all time."
DaveTorrance,"Jun 13, 2015",10/10,"This movie is just a life changing experience converted into a movie! This masterpiece will have you 100% concentrated on your screen for 2 hours and you will totally enjoy every second of it. David Fincher created an almost flawless movie based on the incredible novel by Chuck Palahniuk. The Fight Club is a movie that portrays perfectly our society, expressing the boring routine of our lives in the day-by-day, such as working on our boring jobs and doing things we don't like because we don't have control of our lives. The amazing performance of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt will make you fall in love immediately with this film. Without a doubt this is a 10 out of 10 movie, and if you haven't seen it already, then what the hell are you doing with your life?"
gasmaskbase,"Sep 30, 2015",10/10,"FIGHT CLUB premiered in the US with a wave of publicity focusing on its violence and nihilism; some critics countered this with the statement that it was an anti-materialist jeremiad.On a 2nd watching of the film, it seems like neither to me. It's easier to see it as a thoughtful, strong and complex movie. Director David Fincher once again dazzles us with his work, which is as brilliantly energetic as the acting of Brad Pitt and also talented Edward Norton.What's really impressive is the manner in which the film manages to tease us with an anti- materialist, hyper- masculine message even as it suggests that we're all a little too sophisticated to buy into it."
amjadalmakki,"Jul 12, 2016",10/10,"well, sir.. this is not something to be interested in reading it, but here I am. I have to say this. frankly watching such a movie while facing insomnia is not the best thing to do but i did it anyway. don't we all have insomnia in a day or another? maybe always? don't we wait until the sun rises to ask ourselves: ""Did I sleep? have I even slept? since when?"" and now i'm fortunately sure that my perspective about every single movie would change. nothing would stay -or stayed - as it is before the fight club. that is not a simple or even a good movie, it is way much more as I know. this kind of movies is what we consider as history, present and future."
saimanikumarsai,"May 1, 2023",10/10,"I never watched a movie like this. Rule no1 never talk about the fight club ad rule no2 never talk about the fight club. David Fincher made a masterpiece . It deserves more than a one time watch. You should definitely love to watch this at least twice. The slow motions shots are insane. Sooner or later it goes big and big.Wahtever the climax plot was mind-blowing I can't expect a scene like that. My mind scolds me "" why didn't you watched a film like this"". On the conclusion made if you haven't watched this watch this. You'll never regret yourself. There is a person inside you who can do anything take it off and show off to the world what you are!!"
The_Double-Thinker,"Feb 3, 2007",7/10,"Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end. To formulate your own opinion, well you will just have to watch this for yourself. Good luck and, please, give me some feedback."
Freethinker_Atheist,"Feb 26, 2015",1/10,"It would be interesting to know the ages of the people who gave this movie more than 5 stars. I just cannot imagine they are older than 20, most of them must be between 13 and 17.The title of this movie made me avoid it like the pest for a long time, sensing it was going to be bad. Yesterday, I finally watched it, and boy, it was even worse than I thought it would be! It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.This movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived. Its sole purpose is desperately try to be different, shocking, revolutionary, subversive. It tries so hard that it fails miserably. And for one simple reason: childishness.Watching grownup men being constantly childish is simply not funny, much less interesting. Unless you are a redneck or not older than 17."

The surprise was hard to believe... bääääm!The Movie starts off very explosively, accompanied by very good CGI renderings for the time. The hidden criticisms of society and consumption are also intriguing and will be part of the story and behaviour for starting a fighting secret society. The characters are portrayed perfectly and Helena Bonham Carter in particular plays her role so perfectly that you have to love her madness. And the ending is as surprising and shocking as in any other film. You should have seen it! ........"
Franek_king,"Feb 16, 2025",10/10,I just watched this masterpiece like 2 weeks ago and was shocked damn.I couldn't believe what iv'e just watched after finishing this masterpiece the whole movie is very fun to watch but the plot is just sooooooo good and well done you couldn't do it any better!If you love plot twists you need to watch this I can't understand how this movie is any lower than 9.I know this movie was rated a 8.9 how in the world the rating got lower.This movie is something else you need to watch this I didn't had Disney but when I got it I knew I needed to watch this.I could never imagine how good it would be and if you didn't watched it yet you have to!
gthepodcast,"May 8, 2020",10/10,"Just one of the best David Fincher movies, the movie is full of plot twists, a good use of the violence, very good script, photography and the use of colours are amazing. Obviously not a movie to watch in family, I think the magic happens when you watch it alone and analyse the situations by your own. You need to watch it a few times to understand, but if you are a very good analyst you will understand at the first time. In my opinion a very amazing movie, it's a piece that puts you very focused on it."
a_zathon,"Jul 2, 2024",7/10,"I watched this film with high expectations as it critically acclaimed for plot, shots and awards none of which i'm saying are deserved but I just felt that personally it was not THAT good for me simply like I said I'm not the target audience dare I say its overrated because some people online painted it out to be good but like i get to a certain extent but even with the reviews about this film I just can't really get into it. However, with that being said not a single moment throughout the film had I picked up the phone while there is a long scene or a monologue from a character and was thoroughly entertained."

xxxxxxdusk,"Jan 26, 2024",10/10,"Like 4400 others I could write now: ""a masterpiece"" and give the film 10/10 stars.But I'd rather tell you that it's exactly these reviews that make me laugh and cry. They rate a film 10 and say it's a masterpiece, but don't even begin to understand what Fight Club is actually about? This film is not about toxic manliness, or rebellion or whatever nonsense. I'll tell you straight up what the misunderstood story in Fight Club is. This is a comment I wrote under a blog ""everybody misunderstands the point in fight club"" in which the blogger himself doesn't understand the point of Fight Club.. The comment that I wrote seems like understandable by some people at least,
so I copy paste it here.HERE IT STARTS:
People don't even understand the main story of Fight Club, because they only analyze parts of the movie. Like overlooking the sinking ship in Titanic, but analyzing the love story between Rose and Jack.The main story in Fight Club is about the process of enlightenment caused by a huge amount of mental suffering. The suffering is a result of identifying with the ego, the things we own and the roles we play in a society of hypocrites. The narrator's subconscious mind creates a hallucination: Tyler Durden. It's a self healing process, a psychosis. The narrator thinks, Tyler is a real person. Tyler shows him, what he needs to change in life in order to find his true self, which will end the suffering:letting go of attachment. Stop identifying with your ego, the things you own. The roles you play in society. It is in the nature of the ego feeling incomplete. Buying new things and a better job makes the ego feel better temporarily, but the feeling of incompleteness will return. All of these are teachings of ZEN Buddhism.Tyler says: ""....never be complete, stop being perfect...."".Be what you really are. Fighting is the meditation/stop thinking aspect. There are countless more hints in the movie for the process of achieving enlightenment:destroying the ego of new project mayhem members. Intentionally losing fights, Tyler and Ed Norton destroy fancy cars with baseball bats, but they stop at the ordinary car, and move on to the next ego-feeding car.Enlightenment is mentioned several times in the movie, for instance the chemical burn scene which teaches: don't run away from suffering, it let us evolve and grow.At the end of the movie the narrator realizes, that Tyler is a hallucination, and shoots himself. Injured, he is telling Marla: ""I am ok, I am really ok, trust me. Everything is gonna be fine"" the injury doesn't matter, because the narrator's suffering has ended.He kills Tyler, because he wants to stop him (himself) from destroying buildings and harm other people. Tyler was his ideal self, but he can't allow him(self) to do that, even if he feels like to do so. Tyler didn't care, because he is created from his subconscious mind, where emotions and beliefs have priority.END OF THE TEXTand I want to add: the rule ""do not talk about FC is, because if everybody would talk about it, the narrator would realize, that there is no Tyler Durden in the real world. Tyler wants to prevent that of course.... Jesus Christ.If you think it is BS what I told you, search google for: Fight Club: An Exploration of Buddhism Charley Reed University of Nebraska at Omaha. And then read the pdf."
edwinalarren,"Feb 12, 2008",10/10,"It is nice to have all the material accoutrement of a thriving, cosmopolitan guinea pig. You are raptured by consumerism, which includes owning several hundred pounds of Scandinavian furniture.You have a precocious infatuation for a white collar title, and your lackluster, extra curricular activities have dictated that you mollycoddle someone with testicular cancer!! As enticing as all of this sounds, you know what sparks your interest even more, BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF SOMEONE!! (I have been underemployed for over eight years now, I am all ears!!) What do you really want out of life? Recognition at the Neanderthal level, or, to be another citified anonymity? The former, of course!! Brad Pitt conveys his message to Edward Norton very convincingly, and now, the trick is to spread the good news, but, remember rules one and two, you are not allowed to talk about it, and, you are not allowed to talk about it!! How do you persevere under such a deranged set of circumstances? Yes!! Boredom constitutes a first rate felony. Fighting to a near death represents an exuberance that has titillated Edward Norton's character to a personal Nirvana!! Dangerously convoluted logic is the ultimate spirituality. You have experienced excruciating chemical pain, someone torched your condo because they want to get to know you a little better, you got fired because you always have blood stains on your clothes, you want to blow up a credit card centralized information building complex, and sex has not been this sensational since seventh grade!! Nobody said that this was a family oriented film!! The aggregate depravity for all of the characters in the movie transcends a diversified experimentation with needless destruction, their devotion to the non-conventional is a little too difficult to comprehend!! What does anybody really accomplish by going this route anyway? Capitualation to the bizarre? This movie's charades of insurrection are exhilarating to the clinically demented (Otherwise known as the fight club) The less I know, the better off I will be I think!! Banalities pertinent to the Bourgeousie have brazenly threatened this bevy of belligerent overgrown boys who wish to brandish their high levels of testosterone... So Now!! Life is one big boxing ring!! This is a potpourri of apocalyptic misgivings which are socially perverse!! How do you empathize with any of this?... You don't!! This website has ranked this movie the 31st best film out of the top 250 ever made.... To concur with these findings would be tantamount to indulging the character that Brad Pitt played, to the nth degree!! The psychopathic rumination involved in all of these felonious antics are even more repugnant than the eating habits of an alpaca!!! It is truly indicative of human nature to favor the form of fruition which is pecuniary, their form of fruition deals with societal malcontent and mutilation!! The resonating agitation, which serves as an inspiration to everyone in this movie, is commensurate with the film ""Clockwork Orange""!!! Both films possess a ruthless determination to establish an adamant,counter-culture militancy with a bunch of immature misfits!! The macabre actions to both of these movies signify a heinous non-justification which is pertinent to everything!!! This is not what the phrase ""Change your sedentary lifestyle"" means!!! There are other recreational diversions out there, maybe golf can fill the void!! As far as unprecedented creativity goes ""Fight Club"" gets a resoundingly perfect ten!!! Overall, however, for ""Fight Club"" to be ranked the 31st best movie ever produced, I don't know, I really just do not know about that one at all!!"
blanche-2,"Sep 2, 2010",10/10,"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are in the ""Fight Club,"" a 1999 film directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls. The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.Edward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc.He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.When Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house.The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.Okay, like ""Mulholland Drive,"" that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.""Fight Club"" starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending.Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.The performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job.Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ingénue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.""Fight Club"" is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film."
sydmwswy,"Sep 30, 2022",10/10,"Is definitely much better than Inception. At the moment, the rating of this movie is higher, but if it comes above Inception, I will no longer appear on IMDb. Because this movie is not science fiction, but it is ten times more effective than a good science fiction. And this is very important. A realistic film is so effective in terms of storytelling. You see, at the same time, there is a lot of complexity in it. And you can enjoy watching it many times. Brad Pitt is completely one with his role. And it doesn matter that the movie is criticizing politics. What is most important is the depiction of modern man, and it is one of the few films that is even better than the original book.Of course I am fan of Nolan....."
behroz,"Oct 11, 2018",10/10,"I look at the Fincher's movies like a film school . as a filmmaker you can learn lots about directing , filming , lighting , custom , blocking and etc. than a school with formal lessons .

T-Boy-3,"Apr 30, 2000",1/10,"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.)""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with."
sharathk-reddi,"Mar 21, 2013",10/10,"first of all let me tell you this is the first time ever i am writing a review so if there are any minor mistakes please don't bother. when i searched for the best mystery thrillers on IMDb i first found this movie on that list, when i searched for the best dark comedies, again i found this movie there, and when i searched for best crime thrillers, there also i found this movie, but its name ""fight club"" suggests action, so i was wondering what is this movie actually about so gave it a try and trust me this movie has everything action comedy suspense crime just everything. not even for a single second i felt bored watching this, right from the first frame you will be into it, and that climax twist was just mind blowing, i really did't except this movie will turn out to be such entertaining. really a grate movie well directed good acting and i still don't understand why this movie did't get an Oscar!!? i highly recommend it to all those movie buffs over there and i tell you, without ""fight club"" any of your movie collection is incomplete."
swiftyl,"Oct 6, 1999",10/10,"The Fight Club is a movie that makes you want to run out of the theatre, drink, smoke a lot, and punch your friends in the face. In a good way.  Big claps to Jim Uhlis for the script, David Fincher for the direction, and the entire cast.  For a movie to begin with extreme tension, tell a rocking good story and then peak beautifully at the end is a rare thing.  If there is a God, this should clean up at the Oscars.  Black, wicked, packed with eminently quotable lines- this is one to see AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, so you're the person who knows what The Fight Club is about, and not the person hearing endless retellings of the best bits.  One Fight Club makes up for Three Thomas Crowne affairs."

nmholland,"May 10, 2016",10/10,"Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a ""fight club,"" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time."
athies,"Jun 14, 2021",10/10,There are so many little things to enjoy.The airport car owner is a joyful moment I forgot.It's different to watch their relationship knowing what we know now.

krutarthamusic,"Jun 7, 2021",10/10,"There are some Films which tries to be the best and there are some Films which you call them Classic. Fight club Definately falls to the second category. I'm still thrilled by the whole experience.Kudos to Screenplay - Such a phenomenal work, one can learn from this.Sound Design - I could personally feel experiencing it.Direction & Cinematography - Top Notch."
sebastiantorrestodd,"Nov 6, 2019",10/10,"I still remember when I was beginning to flirt on my now 6 years girlfriend, she asked me to recommend her a movie, the next day I gave her this dvd gem, the moment the movie finished she called me shocked and we started talking for hours about the movie greatness.The second advise I gave her was to rewatch it, the second viewing is a whole new ride picking up details and enjoying it a different way.Today we watched it again and It still gets me on the edge of my seat, I came here looking for a review that explained my feelings about this movie, but every review I read have a different interpretation of the film, I think beyond the great acting, direction, pace, pretty much everything, this movie hits people in different ways and that's why is the GOAT for me."
johnmconroy,"May 7, 2000",1/10,"How can we get Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Meatloaf to beat the c**p out of each other?  This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedo-philosophies and violence.It's just dumb.  Don't try looking beneath the surface, because nothing is there (maybe that's the point).  It provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life...  their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions.  In order to escape, you fight.  It's so simple!  Give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black t-shirt fight gang.  Makes sense.  Teenage males will certainly think so, since it is filmed in the MTV style...  bright color palette, fancy edits, blood... mesmerizing (and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic).It actually starts our promisingly.  I loved the first quarter.  Only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are, sorry, far out of the grasp of the writers, does it fail.Film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest, tacked-on ""surprise"" endings in cinema history.  I could only laugh.  Bottom line: Dumb."
MilosH18,"Nov 4, 2021",10/10,"I expected this film to be about boxing simply by reading the title, but boy was I wrong. David Fincher successfully caught my attention within the first few minutes, knowing an exciting journey awaits me. The incredible cinematography and editing reeled me in instantly as I could not take my eyes off the screen. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's performance is first class: tireless, hilarious, all undeniable emotions that give life to this story. I rarely ever rate movies a 10/10 and only give it to a masterpiece. This ladies and gentlemen was a masterpiece."
moizsyed-07601,"Jul 11, 2021",10/10,As we discussed a storyline this was a spoiler alert?what a movie directed by David fincher in this movie as we discuss that Tyler durdan didn't exist while I think so the narrator a Tyler durdan what a psychological thrilled. On the start of the movie you think that movie was bored but eventually we watched till the end the movie gives a thrilled a lot of fun. When narrator hold his gun into his mouth and shoots in his mouth where fake Tyler durdan was death.

siddharthdumbre,"Apr 18, 2019",10/10,This movie has a good storyline+drama+ thriller+ deep meaning. So basically everything that you want to see in a film
alex_with_a_P,"Jul 26, 2025",6/10,"When we saw this back in the day, it was edgy, new and sexy. But for some reason I never really wanted to watch it again for over 25 years. Revisiting this with a certain distance and as a different person it seems to me that the movie has indeed value and something to say. Yes, the anti-consumerism rants are still used as memes today. But I think a movie should be able to make you FEEL this. In Fight Club it's always the main character telling you and it gets often preachy whilst trying to be edgy. That combo feels a little bit dated. And it's probably the reason why so many chads misinterpret the movie and think Tyler Durden is the second coming of Jesus.This movie marks the beginning of a lot Fincher trademarks, like the advertising shots, the floating typography or the free flow camera. But Fight Club and Panic Room also have those annoying flashy CGI camera tracking shots that just feel like empty posturing. I'm glad Fincher matured and dropped those gimmicks in later films. It's fine doing it as a cold plunge in an opening scene, it's kind of a hommage to the Mission Impossible intro (1996). Fight Club isn't without merits though, the cinematography is still great and probably the reason this movie still holds up better than it should be. Fincher is so creative with every sequence he's tackling and there's no doubt that he was a huge influence on the renaissance of Korean cinema: a lot of their top directors have talked extensively about how much of a big deal his movies have been.He's also the reason why the original author of the book calls this adaption an improvement over his book.What makes this a bit of a disappointment to me are a couple of things:
One is that none of the characters are likeable in this nihilistic vision. Furthermore the movie gets very plot-driven towards the last act, mixed with the absurdity of blind followers that's very reminiscent of Life of Brian. Unfortunately the movie doesn't commit fully to this idea and instead, the ending we get is pure shock value, a nice final image. It works as a snapshot, but as an ending it seems almost like a cop out. Maybe it is because seeing our two main characters holding hands in front of a theater of destruction appeals to audience's sympathy. A sympathy that doesn't feel earned. When I think of the endings of movies like Life of Brian, Network or Trainspotting (which have a similar attitude towards consumerism), think about how the endings of those films are driving the point home or do something clever. Fight Club makes interesting observations about repressed masculinity, violence as our means of communication, the battle against our wants VS what we need. Given how much of our world is going down the drain because a few Tyler Durdens feel the need to shape the world like their inner decaying worlds, it might be an accurate depiction. And although I enjoyed all of that in the movie, it still didn't grab a'd shake me like it should.Maybe it is because the movie doesn't even offer a counter-point to Tyler's viewpoints and it feels dishonest or too cynical in an artificially way.On my rewatch I felt the same indifference when I watched it in cinema years ago. And I'm not really sure why it doesn't resonate with me much more because the themes and topics still shine bright as neon lights. It's still an entertaining ride thanks to the great directing, but I regard it as one of the 'lesser' Fincher movies."
donniereavers,"Dec 5, 2024",10/10,"I don't have the words! Where do I even begin? Fight Club is truly a most watch and here's why. This movie follows a insomniac who is not very satisfied with his life when suddenly a energetic, determined man named Tyler Durden who will take the man to Fight Club. This movie released in 1999 and it is great for its time. This movie definitely has the biggest plot twist of all time. I couldn't even pick a favourite scene because ever single scene is a banger! Tyler Durden is one of the best protagonist of all time! Brad Pitt played him so perfectly. There also is some emotional scenes but mostly bloody action! There ending was absolute cinema! If you love Forrest Gump, American Psycho, Karate Kid and Shawshank Redemption then you will absolutely enjoy this film. Definitely give this movie a watch right now! Like now.... Go on..."
andrewmerritt-31652,"Nov 25, 2019",10/10,"Fight Club stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, and is directed by David Fincher. The plot revolves around an unnamed narrator, who is bored with his job, until he befriends Tyler Durden, a care free person, and together they start a fight club. Fight Club was one of those movies where I watched it, and I felt inspired. Not inspired to start a fight club, but the overall message was what really spoke to me. Fight Club teaches the audience that we are scared of our lives, which is why we work those boring nine-five jobs because we do what society tells us to do. And that's why we buy stuff we don't need so we can also fit into society as well having the media hypnotizing us that one day we'll be happy with that one special person, but that's a lie. And if people refuse to accept that, well then you just haven't discovered the big picture. And no one explains that well than Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is the person that everyone wants to be him and act like him and he's my inspiration to me because he has a care free attitude toward life and I admire that. When Fight Club was released, it got terrible reviews, but later on it has become a cult movie. And i think the reason it has such a strong cult following, was because when it first was released, nobody understood it, but they instead they thought it was just about fighting. But there's more to it than fighting and that's where people fail to understand this film. And every time I watch Fight Club, the more i understand what it was trying to tell us. So in the end, Fight Club is a punk rock version of A Clockwork Orange, has a very strong message, and something you shouldn't ignore just because it has to do with fighting. And remember the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club."
jeldbring,"Sep 26, 2022",10/10,"I have seen this movie several times and.. .to be honest i never get tired of it. It has such a deep and motivating storyline that will keep you on your feet, and if you don't get it the first or second time... it will come to ýou eventually and, in a way, blow your mind.The characters, storyline and feel of it is superb. Commentary on the socioeconomic way of life is deep and to this day is as relevant now as the day it was made. If anything, it is even more relevant these days than ever! In some magic way it makes you feel connected to more people than you could imagine.I love this movie!"

Qbrick,"Oct 11, 1999",N/A,"The first rule of FIGHT CLUB is.....go see this audacious, cranial busting flick. I sat thru a rousing Dallas screener tonight and walked away with all synapses humming. FIGHT CLUB will be added to a list of movies that made this an incredible year for film(THREE KINGS, AMERICAN BEAUTY). Fincher has fashioned a rowdy, hilarious, blood-soaked allegory of everything that's wrong with Modern Life. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter should all get penciled in for Oscar noms, not to mention Mr.Fincher who proves that he can be frightening and funny at the same time. Though people are beating each other up, the film isn't really about fighting...it's about fighting back."
choatelodge,"May 27, 2003",1/10,"I won't try to write an outline of the film, others have done a good job of that here already, I'll just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it: This is one poor movie. Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale. Oh well, if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly, knock yourself out."

kamaleshrajan,"Jul 27, 2021",10/10,"To be honest, fight club is the best film I have ever seen and witnessed it's sharpness in details. Watching it the first time won't make any impression, specifically. But on the second flow, you will get the crux of the film certainly and find every dialogue impressive and its details which were initially kept in a way that can be understood only on sharp notice. I like its theme and fincher's sharp knowledge about how the world works. The character tyler durden, played by Brat pitt was outstanding which will stand as the prototype for heroism in the upcoming years.Sorry I talked about fight club, but the film made me do this."

The fight scenes are great. The other two factors that make this good are the set designs and the soundtrack by The Dust Brothers. While the script is good and the source material is better, it's trying a little too hard at times making it feel forced. That's where the rating finds its balance."

I have to break the first rule.I cannot and I must say that I cannot forget this movie or even stop talking about it after 20 years. Just straight up, this movie is ahead of its time.The story is a non-stop grandeur development.I can't spoil any bits of this masterpiece. Can only say: this movie is about a man. That's IT. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE. Or else, I'm gonna break the 2nd rule.When I first watched Fight Club in the 2nd year of university, I felt really skeptical. I was scratching my head throughout the whole movie's set up like why the hell is this even in the top 10 IMDB list.And I gotta admit, Fight Club is weird. It's complicated and it might feel like it's going nowhere. I could almost say that I was losing interest in the first act of the movie.But as things build up and just keep building up, I saw the beauty. For the first time in my life, I felt enlightened. I felt something more than just a movie. I was laughing throughout the middle act and then, I got hit really hard in the most disturbing and oddly satisfying way.A movie that can always provoke your thoughts the moment you start watching it again. Fight Club is vulgar, intense and so damn emotional.I would always say that this is neither an action movie nor a thriller movie. But it is Fight Club. It shows me the craziest life journey of a man, being portrayed on a movie screen. The movie editing level is surprisingly movie magic.Too many people are breaking the first rule these days, this is not good."
MatthewLuty,"May 15, 2023",10/10,"Fight Club is a true cult classic and many leave it as such, although I personally see so much more to the movie. This movie has changed my perspective on various aspects of life time and time again and has nevber failed to do so one the many times ive rewatched it. Not only is this movie entertaining without a thought in mind but also allows for viewers to truly analyze and create their very own perspective and meanings to the movies many direct and or indirect analogies. To anyone who has not seen Fight Club I would highly reccomend it regardless of your movie genre prefrences and perspectives. This movie is simlpy entertaining and appealing to all who may watch, and also hold a huge portion of development in what movies have become today, as Fight Club was not only a popular movie, but one that allowed for more complex ideals and practices to be used in the art of film making."
teridib,"Dec 4, 2021",10/10,"This movie is fantastic on the technical side. Most of the movie is set at night, which serves as a perfectly dark tone for the events that transpire. There is excellent camera work, particularly during Durden's iconic speech regarding the eight rules of Fight Club. There are innovative special effects, such as when the narrator describes a possible explanation for an explosion in his apartment building. The movie moves at a brilliant pace, so though its 151-minute runtime seems like it'd be a chore to get through, the film never feels boring even once. Most of the main characters undergo a significant trajectory throughout the film, which is very satisfying to watch. The final shot of the film, which is one of my favorite scenes in movie history, uses awe-inspiring effects, meticulous framing and a legendary song choice to overwhelm the viewer with acute emotions. Once the credits start to roll, you'll be awestruck, still recovering from what you've just witnessed."
theoledoux,"Jul 6, 2021",10/10,"Yes. First time watching Fight Club for me. I'm glad I watched it at this particular time in my life though, because I don't feel like I would've truly grasped the meaning of this story had I been younger. This film does more than entertain the viewer, and that's for sure. It asks some tough questions about our world, but most importantly about ourselves. It's a masterclass in suspension of disbelief. The execution and directing by David Fincher allowed it to approach a most unique proposition with tact. For me it's a masterpiece. But that's enough for today as I've already broken the rules..."

You might think at the beginning the film is a little strange but the way it all unravels at the end of the play is superb and so interesting. Everything starts to come back to you, everything starts to make sense even the little things at the beginning all eventually makes sense it really is a mind blowing movie. In addition to this the overall message is so powerful and conveyed in a fantastic way. I would definitely recommend."
r96sk,"Jan 13, 2021",7/10,"I didn't enjoy this, pretty much at all, but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together. It's a weird one for me.Overall, 'Fight Club' underwhelmed me. I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.The only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.Brad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.I'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*."
bliss66,"May 17, 2002",1/10,"If you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullible--even for a filmgoer.  Never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist, soulless society by none other than News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch).  These people are just toying with you--they're in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever (as is born out by the ending--the film goes...NOWHERE).  Avoid this nonsense."
ybkxnq,"Dec 8, 2023",10/10,"It shouldn't be just my opinion that Fight Club is the best movie of all time. It should be on number one of everyone's list. For me Fight Club isn't even just a movie. It's an experience. It can improve your mindset and your style of living in some way if you understand the movie right. Fight Club is the very peak of television. Even if you don't really deal with the message the movie gives (what you definitely should) it has everything you want in a movie. Fight Club has a great directing style combined with a masterpiece of a story and a breathtaking plot twist. The acting performances of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter make the movie so much more authentic and fun to watch. You can watch Fight Club to really every time and how often you want. It doesn't get boring. In the end everyone has his/her own taste in movies but for me Fight Club is just a masterpiece that changed my life and style of living."
rileyyjayy,"Feb 19, 2024",10/10,"This movie is definitely ahead of its time and wow it still holds up in 2024, this was my first time watching and honestly it was such a roller-coaster. One of the most satisfying and thrilling movies I've ever seen. Brad Pitt in his prime was awesome to see, he definitely nails this role so perfectly. I can now understand why this movie is rated so highly and loved by so many. It's truly a masterpiece. I never give away spoilers in my reviews but all I will say is take the risk and watch this movie. Even if you don't enjoy fighting, you'll still be hooked with this roller-coaster of a physiological thriller. I'd almost say this movie was perfect."
hanalisss,"Jul 23, 2023",10/10,"Mind-bending and rebellious ride with ""Fight Club""! Here's my opinionated take on this cult classic:""Fight Club"" is a gritty and thought-provoking movie that packs a powerful punch. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are an explosive duo, delivering exceptional performances that will stick with you long after the credits roll.Norton plays an insomniac office worker who's disillusioned with his mundane existence. Enter Tyler Durden, portrayed by Pitt, a charismatic and anarchistic soap salesman who challenges everything our protagonist knows about life. Together, they form an underground fight club as a way to break free from society's constraints.What starts as a testosterone-fueled outlet for frustration quickly morphs into something much deeper. The movie delves into themes of identity, consumerism, and the human desire to break away from the confines of modern life. It's a dark and twisted exploration of masculinity, rebellion, and the human psyche.""Fight Club"" is raw, unapologetic, and thoughtfully chaotic. It's not just about the physical fights; it's about the internal struggles and the search for meaning in a world that often feels empty and superficial.The plot takes unexpected turns that will leave you questioning reality itself. It's the kind of movie that demands multiple viewings to fully grasp its brilliance.Aside from the thought-provoking themes, ""Fight Club"" is known for its iconic quotes, stylish direction by David Fincher, and a killer soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's edgy atmosphere.Now, be warned, ""Fight Club"" isn't your typical Hollywood fare. It's bold, it's daring, and it'll challenge your perceptions.

Just remember, the first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. Enjoy!"
gonzalodacruzabreu,"Jun 27, 2021",10/10,"Icredible plot, based on the actual society, it mistreats all those consumerism attitudes of people and the stressed lives they have, the characters try to leave the material and be happy with their poor lives, so they want to find the real sense of the life with self-destroying thoughts."

IMDB2892,"Oct 4, 2025",6/10,"A well known movie of the 00's, well reviewed and raved about. There are only a few movies that stand out each year/decade. Given there is so many movies that do come out each year, may be worth while to be selective in what you watch.Movie is about a office worker who quits his day job and lives a life different then what he imagined. Know there was a PS2 game of this. I don't recall the story aside from what I have shared earlier so might not be as good or blends into life too well."
asherplay,"Jul 10, 2012",1/10,"(Preface: I really think I was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling, but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you, don't read on.)Let's face it - it's all about fighting - gruesome, stupid, uncivilized, uncultured, immature fighting. If you are a caveman, go ahead and like this movie. If not, then I am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world.On a side note, despite the plot holes, I figured out who Pitt's character was since the end-of-the-apartment scene. I'd be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing.The very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body - immature, shallow, and useless. I just gotta say it - this is my least favorite movie of all time."
jcdentonnnnn,"Dec 7, 2021",10/10,If you haven't seen this movie yet You're missing out theres not many movies out there for men that goes this deep.Acting director and music are fantastic this was what movies were about back then before came the woke crowd and all about cash.
dskywalker0,"Mar 3, 2021",10/10,"This film is a classic and it comes from a disturbed, yet brilliant mind. The acting is flawless, the soundtrack is amazing, there's not one thing wrong with it. I particularly like how it depicts the 1990s, this paradoxical hollow-but-deep quality with a neopunk-like urge, it's edgy, it's nonsensical to an extent, it comes from a very real place. It's everything it's supposed to be and Project Mayhem is a rite of passage that every teenager needs to see as utterly revolutionary at some point. Brilliant."
smogarts,"Jun 19, 2023",10/10,"Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time, deserving an exceptional 11/10 rating. It stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic history, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional storytelling. David Fincher's direction, combined with a stellar cast, delivers an unforgettable experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. From the moment the film starts, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The brilliance of Fight Club lies not only in its captivating plot and visceral action sequences but also in its profound exploration of societal discontent and the human psyche. The enigmatic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are beyond extraordinary, capturing the raw essence of their characters with unparalleled intensity and authenticity. Pitt's Tyler Durden is a charismatic force of nature, while Norton's unnamed narrator is a haunting embodiment of disillusionment and suppressed desires. The chemistry between them is electric, fueling the film's unrelenting energy. The plot itself is a rollercoaster of suspense and unpredictability, leading to a mind-blowing twist that has become legendary in the annals of cinema. This revelation turns the entire narrative on its head, challenging our perceptions and forcing us to question the very nature of identity and reality. Fight Club's bold social commentary on consumerism, masculinity, and rebellion resonates deeply, making it a film that transcends mere entertainment. Fincher's meticulous direction, coupled with its gritty visual style and the iconic narration by Norton, creates an immersive atmosphere that is both dark and visually stunning. The film's impact goes far beyond its release, continuing to influence and inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. Fight Club is a groundbreaking work of art that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance. It is a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic gem, and a testament to the power of storytelling."
dylanwhaley,"Jul 7, 2021",10/10,The narrator is depressed isolated lonely and addicted to ikea. He hates his job and life and needs to find a way out.. then he meets tyler durden. A care free witty handsome man who is everything he wants to be. They slowly descend into revolution violence and anarchy. This movie in a lot of ways reminds me of taxi driver and joker. Men who feel like nothing but want to become something. But that something might not be exactly what they wanted. Great movie and great commentary on isolation delusion and how it will drive some crazy.
Amna_Mushtaq,"Aug 11, 2025",7/10,"I liked the portrayal of the protagonist's escape from consumerism, that constantly buying more doesn't heal the emptiness within. I love Tyler Durden's quote, ""The things you own end up owning you,"" which captures this idea perfectly.But beyond that, the protagonist, suffering from a severe mental illness, harms countless innocent people. Characters like Bob pay the price for his delusions, yet all of it is framed as awakening.FILMS INFLUENCE MINDS. Films like Fight Club and mob dramas can normalize aggression, violence, toxic masculinity, disrespect towards women, and power obsession, yet offer no concrete solutions for the problems they explore. Fight Club leaves too much open to glorification. It makes all the insanity look deep or cool.One message behind this movie could be that once you let harmful ideologies grow, you can't control them, and that rebellion can turn into mindless violence, and men searching for meaning can destroy everything, thinking it's liberation. If that was the intended message, then yes, it would have been a strong one."
larserikg,"Jun 2, 2001",1/10,"Boring, quasi-philosophical violence-feast. The plot is dumb, the ""surprise"" twist is not surprising, the dialogue is stiff and lifeless (with lines like ""What you´re feeling is premature enlightenment""). Furthermore, Helena Bonham Carter isreally, truly miscast. How can anyone like this movie? (I know a lot of people do, but I just cannot understand why)."
MissCzarChasm,"Apr 1, 2000",10/10,When Fight Club was first released to theaters i was very reluctant to go see it. I heard from many people that it was confusing and that it made no sense. They were so wrong. when you watch this movie you have to go in with an open mind. this movie isn't for the naive you must know how the human mind works to really enjoy the film. i must say that the film was great.I won't waste time telling you the plot because there is so much to it i might give something away but i will comment on the acting. Edward Norton is by far one of my favorite actors. he play just about anyone and he is very good in this film. Brad Pitt is in top form in this film. in fact this is the best thing he's been in since Se7evn. loved his performance. Helen Bonham Carter was also good as the lone female in the movie. very powerful performance.The camera work in this film is magnificent and David Fincher i ggive you much admiration for putting this film together.Fight club is exciting from the begining to the very surprising end. go see it now. 8 out of 10.
beingasif,"May 19, 2021",10/10,"One of the most unique films I have ever seen. The theme of this movie is unique and fascinating. Direction is spot-on. Cinematography, pacing and editing is brilliant. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton was the perfect choice for the respective roles.A masterpiece in every sense. One of the best movie of all time without a doubt. Can watch this movie numerous time."

HockeyHayden28,"Nov 4, 2021",10/10,"This movie should be seen by all young men. There isn't a lot of movies for men today. There's Dead Poets Society & the Sandlot (Lol) but every year it seems like a coming of age movie for women comes out (not that, that is a bad thing) the problem is that young men don't have many movies that explain our frustrations like fight club does. It shines a light on what it feels like to be a young guy in our generation, while telling a wild ride of a story. Not only is the first time u see this movie a mind blower and a twist, you get even more out of it the second time around, with things you might not have noticed the first time. This is my all time FAVORITE movie and I don't give it that title lightly. I would give this movie more stars if it would let me."
