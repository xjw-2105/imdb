maurernh1,"Apr 29, 2006",9/10,"Come and See is one of the rare films that I can remember being emotionally drained upon its conclusion. The expression on my face as I sat there watching the credits scroll by seemed as worn and broken as that of the protagonist, Florya.The film follows Florya as he ""joins"" (i.e. obtains a gun) a partisan group resisting the German advancements in the forests of his native Byelorussia during World War II. What he witnesses at the ripe age of 12 changes a once open-eyed, smiling face into a weathered, traumatized one that has experienced the unimaginable.And of course the unimaginable were the Nazi atrocities committed during the war. Come and See does not focus on what the German Army did to the Jewish population but rather what they did to the native Soviet population. The Nazis were not only concerned with the utter destruction of the Jews but of the Bolshevik Party as well. And to Hitler that meant any man, woman, or child living under communist rule. And this ""cleansing"" fell into the hands of the SS who, as depicted in the movie, literally destroyed every sign of life.Florya is able to escape death, unlike the rest of his family, but serves as a witness to the destruction and in this sense ""dies"" as his innocence and youth is lost. Klimov does a masterful job and depicting this slow death by concentrating on the facial expressions of Florya versus that of the Germans and both of their transformations over time. Klimov's Hitler montage at the end is especially moving and puts an interesting spin on the whole ""what if"" question.This is the most historically accurate war movie I have ever seen and would highly recommend it to any war/history enthusiast. But I would also recommend it to any film watcher that realizes the goal of the medium which is to evoke emotion in the audience, and Come and See does just that."
Asa_Nisi_Masa2,"May 3, 2007",10/10,"Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most ""satisfying"". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars.On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains ""propaganda"" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin ""was no better than Hitler"" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie's context - Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me."
vlad_reven,"Mar 22, 2008",10/10,"What most of the foreign viewers perhaps don't understand is that the factual side of the movie has always been a common knowledge among millions of Russians especially those of older generations. People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier's rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a ""time machine"" in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed."
FilmFlaneur,"Dec 29, 2004",10/10,"One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.At the heart of the narrative is Floyra, both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film's narrative, his history a horrendous coming-of-age story. It begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end, he finally uses one. As he travels from initial innocence, through devastating experience, on to stunned hatred, in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes, both inside and out. His fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses, frequently staring straight back at the camera, as if challenging the viewer to keep watching; or while holding his numbed head, apparently close to mental collapse. Often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view, the formal quality of Klimov's film owes something to Tarkovsky's use of the camera in Ivan's Childhood, although the context is entirely different.The film's title is from the Book of Revelations, referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 'Come and See' is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war, but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path, witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here, the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera, point-of-view shots, and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events: the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander's arm for instance, soundtrack distortions, or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.Main character Floyra is the director's witness to events, a horrified visitor forced, like us to 'see' - even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village, there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet, or will be ever, able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them, Glasha's reaction to off-screen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so, we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence: one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra - just as later, more explicit horrors do the viewer.Come And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including, at one point, wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko's face is unforgettable during this and other experiences, and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, as did elements of a much-commented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov's camera ranges through and around the atrocities, although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity, technically as well as mentally, by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are, others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing, achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg's work concludes with a dramatic irony that's perhaps a little too neat, contrived for different audience tastes, Klimov's less accommodating epic finishes on a unique, cathartic moment - no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed, but one which sends real blame back generations.Hallucinatory, heartrending, traumatic and uncompromising, such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing, although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov's last film for, as he said afterwards ""I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done,"" no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece, which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing, any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War - a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation, symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel, like I do, that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all, then Come And See is an absolute go and watch."
sellery,"May 14, 2006",10/10,"The best true-to-life war movie I have ever seen, and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. My eyes were opened when I saw this for the first time a few days ago. It made me realise what I miss 99% of the time when watching movies. So few affect me like this one did.No special effects of note, no big budget, no set-pieces of note, no heroes, no redemption. I feel quite sure the director has really captured what war 'feels' like - unlike Spielberg and Coppola's depictions of war, this director lived through WW2 and the horrific siege of Stalingrad, as well as spending many months researching the massacres in Belarus, one of which he depicts in this film (this from the DVD extras, well worth watching).The direction, cinematography, soundtrack and AMAZING acting by a first-time untrained actor in the main role are faultless, in my humble opinion.I found this film depressing and emotionally draining, but cannot wait to watch it again."
paulmartin177,"May 12, 2006",10/10,"I have a bad habit of reading too many reviews and comments about a film before I've seen it, mainly to get an idea about whether it's going to be worth a couple of hours of my time watching it. As a result, I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see, as all the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectations out of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with Elem Klimov's 'Come and See', a film I'd read a lot about, particularly here on the IMDb. (Imagine my ""excitement"" when, having tried to see the film for nearly a year, I discovered it was to be released on DVD a week or two ago from today!) Well, I finally watched the film yesterday and... well, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer intensity and unflinching visceral horror of the atrocities that 'Come and See' invites us to... come and see. (Has anyone commented before on what a clever title that actually is...?) This is one of those films, like, say, 'Requiem For A Dream' or 'The Magdalene Sisters' (both of which, though great films, are simply not in the same league as Klimov's film), that one does not (obviously) so much enjoy as submit oneself to. By the end of such films we are left numbed and shell-shocked, wondering what we are supposed to do with the intense emotions that have been evoked within us. Yes, I felt like the ground had been pulled from beneath me; yes, what I saw in that film made my blood boil, my head hurt and my heart pound; and, yes, it showed me things I'd seen before but to a degree of intensity and detail that I had not experienced before. The point though, I guess, is that the role of cinema (and art in general) is not to offer answers or tell us what to think but to simply show us particular events and characters and allow us to come to our own decisions about what those things 'mean'. I'm rambling now, but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is, with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside, a film whose very title alone demands that it be seen. It is the work of a visionary, a cry of despair from the depths of hell, and an important reminder of humanity's capacity for inhumanity Go and see..."
LSigno,"Jun 25, 2001",10/10,"There's not much one can say about this movie, besides ""Be warned, it's going to hurt you - a lot"". The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and it's Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to ""clear"" the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven't been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to ""join the fight"" he get much more he had bargained for. It's a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. There's no catharsis (this is not Schindler's List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village's destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. ""Come And See"" is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR's beginning) or ""The Thin Red Line"" seems just artificial. This is the real thing!"
barkingechoacrosswaves,"Feb 29, 2020",3/10,"I have never been in a war zone, and am poorly informed about the horrors experienced by the Soviet people at the hands of the Nazis. Doubtless I have much to learn, but could not learn it from this film.This movie, which is like a parody of a late Goya painting set in the forests and villages of Russia, was very hard to watch. The difficulty is not so much the brutality of the events depicted as the relentless overacting and completely unnatural performances of the actors. Everyone behaves as if they were psychotic in almost every scene, and the camera is often positioned right in front of their faces. Their expressions are, like their mannerisms, so over the top as to make the film difficult to take seriously. As if this weren't enough, the music -- interspersed with snippets of military songs or anthems -- continually makes the emphatic statement IN ALL CAPS that we are watching crazy people enduring unbearable conditions.To my way of thinking, this film is trying much too hard to make its point. I felt that it could have said much more, with much less. Even the film's length, at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, goes overboard; it could have benefited from some serious editing. Bludgeoning its audience, it mistakes brute force for tragedy, falling well short of its own ambitions."
robred69,"Feb 20, 2001",N/A,"Come and See , well if you hate violence and brutality then you certainly wont want to see this. This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever, only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture , is how the director uses a child's perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is.I dont want to go into the plot , as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film , but when viewing this film , please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening , as you wont sleep.The acting accolades of course goes to the main characters , but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander , who was just simply , superb. Everything about him was what you'd expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks , the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit , and the SS soldier , who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak , after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are sub-human and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men , that they are not just fighting for Socialism , but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you'll have to see.Come and See is nothing short of disturbing, awesome, powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 1941-1945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director. Only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can be put in the same League table."
lee_eisenberg,"Jan 7, 2017",10/10,"Elem Klimov's final film is a devastating look at the horrors of war through the eyes of a teenage boy who joins the partisans in Belarus (then the Byelorussian SSR or White Russian SSR). Much like Mike Nichols's ""Catch-22"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Idi i smotri"" (""Come and See"" in English) makes you feel as if the war is hitting you directly. And this movie leaves little to the imagination in showing the Nazis' brutality. Probably the most famous scene is when the Nazis burn down a house. There's music playing the entire time to ensure that the noise doesn't stop. You have rarely seen something as intense as this on screen.Klimov's wife Larisa Shepitko directed the equally intense movie ""The Ascent"", about some Soviet troops who try to defend a house from the Nazis (Shepitko got killed in a car wreck a few years later). The important thing to remember is that the Soviet Union lost almost 27 million people fighting the Nazis, more than any other country (it probably would've been more if the winter hadn't held the Nazis back). There's a reason why Russians still refer to the Great Patriotic War, as opposed to simply World War II. And this is one of the many movies that emphasize it. Definitely watch it."
clanciai,"Apr 26, 2021",10/10,"This is one of the most realistic war films ever made, and it's the more realistic for being shown and exposed from the point of view of a child, which enhances the impact and makes the realism with its constantly increasing chain reaction of shocks, more and more growing to unbearable self-tormenting horrors and abhorrence, the more almost unendurable, but you have to stay on and see it all thorugh to the end. It is to be noted, that he never uses his rifle until in the very end, and the only target of his ultimate fire is some images. But that final outburst opens the finale of the greatest sequence of the film.You can't say too much about a film like this, words will never be enough, it is one of the greatest cinematographic experiences you'll ever have at the cinema, and although just one view of it all is enough for a lifetime, you will never be able to forget the details, and many sequences will recur in your mind, forcing you to consider this part of the war and its reality with no end to your shocked emotions and deeply disturbed indignation of an endless upset. It is very reminiscent of Tarkovsky, but it is better still than Tarkovsky, more realistic and more consistent in its absolute implementation. The Tarkovsky film that comes closest to this is his major masterpiece ""Anton Rublev"", which is equally consistent and overwhelming in its composition. But Elem Klimov and his writers go further, forcing the realism on their audience in constantly increasing crescendo in its horros, worse and more realistic than anything that Jerzy Kosinski wrote. This is a towering masterpiece of war films looming over all other war films, as it is a true story and almost more documentary than any realism could be for its unfathomable psychology in depicting a child's experience and reactions to all this."
AndreiPavlov,"Jun 5, 2013",10/10,"To write a simple review seems to be an easy task. Let's complicate the matters a bit. If You have time and inclination, perceive my point and method of commenting this particular movie. All right, here we go. What do we have on the negative side? The following lines are taken out from the IMDb reviews.1 ""The soundtrack is boring, without any decent music at all... Indeed, this is not a realistic film in any way, shape or form... Its propaganda, devoid of any artistic merit. I give it the minimum score because of its extreme pro-Soviet bias, which makes the film offensive and indeed Soviet propaganda"". (by Jose Cruz)2 ""And I love films, but really films are supposed to be entertaining. Or shocking. Or thought provoking. This is so tedious it feels like the director is calling the viewers bluff"". (by robc-26 from United Kingdom)3 ""A war movie should educate the viewer in any of a number of ways. We should appreciate courage and sacrifice, we should empathise with the cold, hungry and terrified. We should be told about historical events and their impact on the final outcome"". (by Reebox from United Kingdom)4 ""Lack of dialogue and explanation means that much of the time you don't know who people are or where they're going or what they hope to accomplish when they get there"". (by hanfuzzy from Barrie, Ontario, Canada)5 ""The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called ""intense"" scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character"". (by dubbs37 from United States)6 ""Bad lead character development"". (by entej from Russian Federation)7 ""The film is very slow and at many times throughout, nothing much is happening... The long, ringing in your ears, muted sound is off putting and not effective"". (by richard6 from United Kingdom)8 ""I wanted to see more actual fighting, and how the war was perceived by soldiers not a 12 year old boy..."" (by Steve Johnson (twiglet-1))9 ""The Nazis was professional killers, OK, but they were yet civilized (if I could say so) beside of a savage hypocrite murders called russians with their red army!.. Nazis were stupid kids beside Red Holocaust and Stalin. Be serious!!!!!"" (by nazratst from Romania)10 ""The infamous village massacre happens in the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, and the German soldiers look so ridiculously evil and cartoon-like that it's very hard for this scene to have any particular interest or emotion. To be honest, I was so bored up to this point that the barbaric events unfolding on screen before me were almost welcoming as at least something was finally happening"". (by JSwallowX1 from Ireland)So, we can sum it all up in the lines below (adding some groovy spice will also help).Being a piece of blunt Soviet propaganda, the film is devoid of any historical accuracy and artistic merit. It's dull and tedious with an uninteresting main character (who has absolutely no background and is free from any development – either physical or mental). Who cares about some kid during the war times? Give us a HERO, not a whimpering child! This ""war"" flick is neither entertaining nor serious. Its fictional happenings (women and children burnt in the barns by the Nazis? come on, in reality it was vice versa! read the historical documents!) pump up to the levels of ""Star Wars"" with one serious difference: ""Star Wars"" was at least thought-provoking and shocking. There is no decent music in the movie at all and the whole soundtrack cries out to get turned off. The last straw that could break any camel's back (i.e. insult any viewer's ears) was some cheap melody at the end of the flick. The whole movie is boring to such degree that any normal human being will yawn and fall asleep during the initial 10 minutes. If you want to see a real feat for the eyes and ears, watch the documentary ""Der Ewige Jude"", which IS a masterpiece at all levels and on top of everything has realistic cow scenes (unlike this one). Watch any USA picture with the WWII topic – they are not many, but at least they represent the historical facts and show us WHO won the World War II and at WHAT unspeakable price... The Russians exaggerate things immensely, making the events going on on their territory look like some kind of annihilation. Nonsense. The Germans were never cruel during the WWII on the USSR territory and they always behaved in a most decent manner. It was Russian troops who were deranged killers (there is even a historically accurate photo of a Russian soldier bullying a poor German woman and robbing her of her bicycle! and it happened in the streets of Berlin when the war was over! Check out the I-net archive footage if you don't believe! just imagine WHAT was happening during the war days!). The verdict: if you are a sane civilized and thinking European, stay far away from this schmoopy fantasy.Do You agree? What do You know about the WWII? How empty is Your vision? To which extent are Your brains brainwashed and ""freed""?Any further comment is superfluous. Actually, this movie does not need any review or comment. But our today's way of life needs it badly. And today's cinema.Thank you for attention."
max-lisser,"Feb 8, 2011",7/10,"It would be very, very hard to recommend this movie to a stranger. Picture it: ""This film was very moving, it just breaks your heart what happens to these people, it's all so horrible...hey wait, where are you going? Please, come back!"" It's impossible to say that I felt good, in any definition of the word, after watching Come And See. The Belarusian countryside is shot beautifully, its depiction of Nazi war crimes is terrifying, and yes, the fate that befalls its main character is heartbreakingly sad. But there's so little that is actually said, I was not certain that this film was actually meant to have a protagonist.I'm afraid to say that I eventually gave up on this film. It blasts horror into the viewer's eyes like a shotgun held directly up to one's eye socket, and it actually ends up numbing you. I gave up caring about what happens to the protagonist, because by that point, death would actually be merciful."
druce,"Mar 16, 2022",6/10,"War is hell, and so is this movie. This was over-the-top violent without a great deal of historical context, character development, or deep meaning. I wouldn't call it realistic, more surrealistic. It's an interesting cultural artifact and has well-executed sequences, but I'm not sure it should be this high on the list of great war movies, or movies generally. It's definitely pretty high on the list of most unpleasant experiences in the IMDB top 250."
rogierr,"Jan 17, 2002",N/A,"Elem Klimov and Aleksei Rodionov's handheld cinematography, present the viewer with the mental and physical destruction of a boy who changes in front of your eyes beyond recognition.Cacophoneous, industrial sounds and sometimes cryptic story-elements (for as far as there is a story) contribute to this ruthlessly escalating history lesson about Nazi's who burned down hundreds of villages in 1943 in Russia. The realism makes you wonder how many people were harmed making the film, while the score represents the mindnumbing experiences of Florya, a tour-de-force performance by Aleksei Kravchenko (16 at the time).  All along, somehow Klimov knows very well how to prevent the audience from becoming numb.ILM's specialFX are smoother, but the FX here in 'Come and see' are so realistic, it's almost unreal: reminiscent of the first 30 min of Saving private Ryan, Thin red line (watch the animals), Apocalypse Now and the painstaking 'Band of brothers'.  Indeed forget about the rest of 'SPR', Platoon and even Full Metal Jacket.  However, I would like to recommend Deer Hunter (Cimino, 1978) and Hotaru no haka (1988).  But I never suspected there was something massive like this.  10/10"
matjusm,"Jan 27, 2007",10/10,"This is just about as powerful as a war film can get.The year is 1943. A teenage Belorussian boy by the name of Florya finds a rifle and then joins the resistance to fight the Germans. On the way he sees all the horrors of war and thats what this film is really about.This is one of the most powerful war films I've seen and I have seen a lot. The events aren't dramatized too much and the film manages to keep a good sense of realism. At the same time however it achieves an excellent surrealistic atmosphere by contrasting this young boy to the horrors of war that surround him. The soundtrack helps a lot in this area by not really providing music in the traditional sense but rather these very tense and powerful, slightly ambient noises. Reminded me a lot of the sound that an orchestra makes when they're getting ready right before the start of a concert. Now the film was made during Soviet times so it does show the Germans in a bad light and as very cruel but to a large extent, thats how things were. Aleksei Kravchenko, the actor portraying Florya, pulls the job off well despite his young age. He doesn't have much dialog to say and this really is more of a visual film.To add to the artistic qualities of this film, there is also an excellent technical side. In addition to the soundtrack which I mentioned before, this film has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a long time. Director Elem Klimov makes excellent use of the steadycam with which he follows his characters as they go from one place to another and without cutting away. There are two excellent examples of this: First is when Florya comes back to his village and the camera follows him as he comes down a hill, goes into his yard and then into his house. The second is the last shot in the film which follows a collumn of soldiers, then takes a brief detour (which is more of a shortcut actually) into a forest and then rejoins that group of soldiers some time later. Simply awesome. The battle scenes are very intense, especially one of a group of German soldiers taking out a village. What I really liked was that everything seemed genuine. During one scene where a bomber bombed a forest, you could really see the dirt being kicked up and trees falling down.An absolute must see film."
AdmiralCallum,"Sep 4, 2012",10/10,"I consider my self to be a real war buff. I Have watched a HUGE number of war movies in my time. My library of books on the subject of war dwarfs that of my local library. I have visited many battlefields and have spent many hours conversing with veterans. However after seeing this film I realised I knew NOTHING of war.the sense of loss, of sadness, of destruction is overpowering. I have never cried after seeing a film. In fact I find it very difficult to cry in general. But about an hour after seeing this film I broke down and cried like never before in my life. That is true art.Saving Private Ryan has often been sited as being in the same league as this in other reviews here. I find this insulting. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved SPR, but to mention it in the same breath as this is just wrong.An event in my life recently reminded me quite strongly of Come And See. There is a beautiful forested aria not far from where I live. An aria of outstanding natural beauty. I have gone for walks there since I was a child, and continued to do so for many years. Some of my happiest memories are of the beauty and tranquillity of that forest. Then about a year ago there was a forest fire. My beautiful forest was gone. Come And See evoked the same feelings of loss and sadness but more intensely. Those were only trees -beautiful although they were- but these were real people. Although Come And See is not based on a true story per se, it is firmly grounded in history, with 628 similar instances. If this film touched you as deeply as it did me, I would recommend a trip to the Khatyn Memorial in Belarus."
calebjoye,"Jan 22, 2023",10/10,"This is another absolute must watch. This film grabs you by the neck and forces you to watch the atrocities that happened to the victims of the Nazi's. It shows you what war does to the life of a boy who starts out wide eyed, eager to defend his country, rendered unrecognizable by the end.The first person perspective puts you wholly into the world, the characters addressing you directly. It isn't overused either, it's done at the moments where it count. I think this was so unbelievably strong. The camera could have been put quartering, at a low angle, etc. But having the camera eye level, straight on, gives us an unrelenting first person perspective, forcing us to put ourselves in the characters situation.So many moments stand out. The dream like shots of the German planes, the distorted audio in the moments of naive innocent fun, the quick shot of the massacred villagers as glasha and florya run away, the tracer rounds lighting up the evening field, florya waking up against the dead cow with his friends blood covering his hand, them flailing through the mud, the cold hardened commander, the chaos of the villagers being locked in the church, the list goes on.This is definitely up there all time, by far the greatest war movie I've seen. Need to rewatch this, there's so much there.I think films like this, as upsetting as they may be, are absolutely necessary for humanity. This is a brutal film, but I needed to be, as the name suggests, it gives you a glimpse of the evil that humanity is capable of, without filtration. They kill animals on camera, burn villages, they'd even throw the lead actor into scenes without telling him what's going to happen.Such a powerful film, and as I already said, a must watch if you haven't seen it yet."
ThurstonHunger,"May 26, 2007",7/10,"A disorienting film about the disorienting nature of war. Symbolic psychotic images fuel the film; and on screen the damage to soul, and to soil, is quite vivid. I think different film-making standards and guidelines in Russia.If I had a bit of a problem, it was that our channel for said soul damage was a teenage boy. While I can see that choice underscoring the innocence that war crushes...or the notion of serving one's motherland, at times my connection to Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya faltered. His trembling, frazzled face...and the camera lingering on it...odd moments of petulance...but then maybe I'm not *supposed* to relate to him, as who really can? Your town invaded, your family massacred...well sadly on earth there are still many who can, but not myself. At one point, there's a shot where he's scouring a large pot, and it's as if he is being cooked alive.Still I felt an older actor might have delivered a more nuanced performance, hell Kravchenko was less than 16 years old when he made this. I see he is still making films to this day, so maybe I need to see his body of work. Indeed as the film went on, he seemed to deal with the shock a little more internally.Sadly, as the film went on, Glasha disappears...there was a time where I felt she was an imagined character. I know of course she was meant to be real, but something about her felt like an externalized innocence that was trying to keep Florya afloat, and alive. A sweet self-defense mechanism?The film though is filled with tragical magical realism. The Hitler hominid that the Russians hump about. Glasha's singing and dancing in the rain, the bog crawl.Ultimately I walked away reminded that war, any war, is such a failure of us as humans. I think this film starts with the image of the kids playing in the wake of the war, infantilely infatuated with infantry...but the lesson comes harsh and fierce.I saw the Kino edition (via Netflix), wish I had come across the version mentioned here with more bonus features. I noticed that this was Klimov's last film for what it's worth. A pretty powerful and savage swan song. I may try his take on Rasputin next...7/10 Thurston Hunger"
R-P-McMurphy,"Aug 7, 2013",6/10,"Russians sure do know how to make a boring movie, no matter how interesting the story is.""Come and See"" is an intense true story about a kind and quiet Russian boy who looks for a gun, which could be his ticket to join the Soviet Army. Little does he know the horrors that will come once he does join the army.It started out pretty good, but it soon got to a point where it all felt messy and nauseating, kind of like the feeling I get when watching an overly artsy Nicolas Roeg film. My only problem with it was that I might've not been in the right mood to enjoy a film like this, but I can't disagree with others calling it a masterpiece. Apart from that, some parts were very uncinematic and the editing was horrible.The best part of the film has got to be the natural cinematography, without it there probably wouldn't be much to talk about. I loved the point of view shots, they made me feel really uncomfortable. Some dialogue was pretty good and there were some scenes that were extremely tense, too bad they were followed by other scenes of boredom and nonsense.I've got to also point out how I loved the way the movie established so many characters in no time by doing simple things like taking a picture and seeing their reactions as they walked towards the group and how they posed was enough to tell me who these guys were. Once again, I have to say the camera work was brilliant, it reminded me of the similar work in ""Children of Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"".Towards the end I kept thinking this would make a great double bill to watch before ""Inglourious Basterds"", for that way you wouldn't look away when the ""Bear Jew"" beats the Nazi who doesn't give Aldo Raine the information he asks him for. There's a sense of realism the movie brings that makes it so discomforting to the viewer, even the bullets used in the movie were real and they even killed a cow. I'm not saying it's just an okay movie, its actually a great movie, but it's not a movie I'd like to see ever again as it left me feeling real bad and might've just ruined my day.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", ""The Pianist"", and/or ""Requiem for a Dream""."
born_naughty,"Jan 26, 2024",2/10,"Idi i smotri (come and see) is an ambitious movie trying to depict the horrors of war in a way no other film I know of has ever done. It's an anti-war movie.However, for me, it completely missed it's mark. All the characters, we mainly follow Fliora and Glasha, behave in such an over the top, erratic, unnatural fashion that I never believe/feel these are real people. At no point do I understand the intentions or motivations of these ""people"". No matter how graphic or shocking the following events are, it's completely negated by that.I also don't know what's going on with the sound. Someone wrote that the reason the sound is like it is, is because we we hear it from Fliora's perspective. That doesn't make a lick of sense to me. It just gave me a headache.It's a very hard movie to watch, listen and experience... for all the wrong reasons."
swillsqueal,"Dec 1, 2008",N/A,"This is the greatest war movie ever. The best way to describe it, I reckon, is to pass on a newspaper article written by Ilya Ehrenburg during World War II when all the things which happen in ""Come and See"" were happening:NIKOLAI VLADIMIROVICH -- ONE YEAR OLD Red Star, November 30 1943How much the Germans have taken from us! They have taken from us not only loved ones, homes, and possessions. Life was complicated. There were dreams, joys, people, many books, many countries. But now everything in me is unchangeably focused on one thing: on the German. I see him -- blue-eyed and inhuman. He walks and kills, he sings and kills, he laughs and kills.Among the papers of the town head of the village of Vyazovaya, recently liberated from the Germans, was found the following document:""List of executed residents of the village of Vyazovaya, Uzninskaya region:1) Muzalevskaya Natalia Ivanovna. 43 years old. 2) Muzalevskaya Natalia Nikolaevna. 18 years old. 3) Muzalevskaya Diana Nikolaevna. 16 years old. 4) Muzalevsky Lev Nikolaevich. 13 years old. 5) Muzalevskaya Valentina Nikolaevna. 9 years old. 6) Muzalevskaya Tamara Nikolaevna. 5 years old. 7) Muzalevskaya Rima Nikolaevna. 3 years old. 8) Davydov Vladimir Ilych. 35 years old. 9) Davydov Anatoli Vladimirovich. 8 years old. 10) Davydov Victor Vladimirovich. 5 years old. 11) Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich. 1 year old. 12) Pryadochkina Maria Petrovna. 60 years old.19 September 1942. Town head Muzalev.""Can this be forgotten? Is it possible to live knowing that people are walking the earth who shot Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich to death, one year old, an infant, the baby Kolya, shot him and ordered his name entered into a list? It is hard to talk about it, but impossible to forget. We still have a long way to go. But we will get there. We will find them. We will find them under their beds, in their vegetarian cafeterias, at the ends of the Earth. We will remember the one-year-old Kolya Davydov. We will remember much. **********The director, Klimov, concentrates on faces. From the faces you can see what they saw. Come. Come and see what this war was about in the Soviet Union. This was a war to the death; the Soviets knew and the Germans knew it. The Germans knew it because their leaders declared it so and 23 million Soviets paid with their lives. Ten million Germans also paid the price of that sale. The seller pays the price of the sale."
perica-43151,"Jun 27, 2018",10/10,"This movie has had to restrain itself from showing the true level of German atrocities in Belarus and Russia, in order not to be distracting. But what is shown is enough, and the movie is beautifully done. The director did not make any more movies because he said everything he wanted to say.This is war movie like no other. If you want to understand what happened, this is a must see. There are so many movies about Holocaust, but the level of suffering on the Eastern front is unfortunately for political reasons severely underplayed in the West. 20 million Russian and Soviet civilians died from the Nazi hand.The decency with which this movie tells the truth about the war is really worthy of greatest respect. There is not a second that is fake in this movie, it is pure, distilled soul of the Soviet people and their struggle against Hitler. If you want substance, look no further. There has been no other movie like this."
dbborroughs,"Jan 19, 2008",9/10,"I needed to have two hours and twenty odd minutes to watch this with out interruption. I didn't want to break it for any real reason or for any real length of time other than to change the disc (more on that later).I had the time so I watched the movie.I could argue that with two small flaws this is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made.This is the SUBJECTIVE story of a boy who joins the partisans during the German invasion of Russian and his decent into hell.This is a tough movie. its in your face and everyone else's, literally as we see everyone and everything that our hero does even to the point that if he's talking to someone the camera will hold on them as they speak with no cut aways. We learn everything about people by their faces since we have the time to study them. This is simply one of the few times where even if the film had had a different aspect ratio other than 1.33 (tv shape) I would rally to have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because for this movie you MUST lose yourself in what you see and hear. Having someone facing you, looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face. Faces are a landscape in this film.This is especially true of Floyra, our hero who's stunned expression at all that happens around him is a constant source of wonderment.As we as shocked and rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there and he is expressing it on his face. Its said he was hypnotized to be able to get the right expressions, and seeing the pain on his face I believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it... Wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries to just get on...The film as I said is subjective and we see and hear, literally, what Floyra does. When his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct. Sound will drift in and out and we get a sense of being there. The camera also holds on some scenes at times Not cutting away for better angles simply because Floyra doesn't have them.This film will rock your world and then some.I want to tell you everything about the film but at the same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as to what happens. Reading the material on the film and seeing the trailer set up some expectations in my mind, some of which was right and some was wrong. I would like to have you see the film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience the film straight. I lost my expectations the minute the film began and I was wondering what was going on... I was hooked as the long strange trip took over. I'm certain that once the film stats you will be free of expectations too but, at the same time I think if I told you too much it would ruin the what happens next.This is GREAT film making.That said there are two small flaws.First, as some reviews have said the Germans, when they finally show up on screen are just a tad cartoony. menacing but slightly cartoonish...I could be wrong... but regardless through it all Floyra's pained expression cuts the cartoon away and reminds us this is bad stuff going down.The second flaw is a montage of actual footage used near the very end. I know why it was done, or can guess, but its too long. It breaks the spell in some ways... I think it would have been more apt had the film had the original desired title of ""Kill Hitler"".The last point I want to make is the fact the film is on two DVDs. Released two years ago there is no logical reason for the film to be broken into two parts, the tape is a single cassette release, except that like many films from the Russian Film Council its loaded with subtitles, 13 languages and three audio options. There is also other extras like an introduction by the film maker that runs 20 minutes, documentary footage and an interview with the lead actor. But I digress....I'm certain that the film doesn't really need to be in two parts for any reason other than a technical one... except that in a strange way the break sort of works for the film if you watch it straight through taking only a break to switch discs. Call me crazy but the break is perfectly placed at the mid point to the story. Not only that the film changes from first half to second half. The tone , even though continuous in action, is different as the second disc begins. Its almost as if we are back at the beginning of the film at a peak that slowly slides downward. Time wise the two halves are different with the action taking place over a couple of jumbled days while the second is one continuous series of events over two days.In the end all that matters is the film.And here the film is absolutely great.See it and be moved.----------------------------------- random thoughts In its way its comparable to grave of fireflies The film that many people compare it to, Destiny of a Man, is a relation but not direct ancestor of it simply because the films are very different, Destiny taking place over years in Flashback, Come and See is happening here and now over weeks. They share themes and elements but the thrust and points are different, especially in the end..."
MrVibrating,"Nov 2, 2006",10/10,"Idri I Smotri is the most horrifying war movie you'll ever see. No, I have not seen every war movie but I've seen many and none of them were remotely close to this.If an American war movie is considered anti-war, you usually see really gruesome stuff happening to soldiers. American movie wars are fought in computer servers, a totally unpopulated battlefield were the troops can run around and kill each other. If a movie shows bad stuff happening to civilians, it's always limited and often implied.Idri I Smotri goes all out and shows you the whole thing. Rape, murder, massacre, brutality in every way imaginable. There is very little plot, a tool to further show the randomness and confusion of war. The happenings on screen are often bizarre and unexpected, and dialog is confused, desperate, hopeless and often barely human.On top of the ghastly pictures is a whine, drone, noise, call it what you will. I'm guessing someone call's it ""soundtrack"" but that's too generous. It's nauseating, and very effective.Acting is extremely believable, characters feel real as life. That doesn't mean they are likable, rational or enjoyable, but they're undoubtedly there, experiencing first-hand what we are seeing filtered through or TV screen.I will never forget this movie. It leaves a mental scar in your mind which takes a few days to recover from and you'll probably never recover fully. If you've seen movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""We were soldiers"" and felt they were too strong, DON'T watch this movie. If you never feel terribly affected by movies, well, you'll soon know what it's like."
jjshepherd-86542,"Jun 12, 2022",10/10,"I've only seen this movie twice, and trust me, for most, that will be more than enough - that's how unsettling this movie is. It is filmmaking at its most powerful. If you thought that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was intense, this makes that look light-hearted by comparison. It's easily one of the most terrifying and unsettling films in history. May as well be the greatest horror movie ever made, but there is zero consolation anywhere in the film that what you're watching is fictitious. Regardless, I firmly assert this is one of the top fifty films of all time.It doesn't matter how many horror films you have seen, this movie is something else because it's about what really happened, hundreds of times in Belarus and across eastern Europe, in my grandparents' lifetime. Attention to detain and accuracy by the director and screenwriter (both of whom lived through the nightmare of the Second World War's Eastern Front) is seemingly boundless.Director Elem Klimov never made another film after this, he said, because he had nothing left to say. When one also knows that he his co-screenwriter Ales Adamovich lived through this hell, it's easy to see why this would be.This film is recommended (don't know quite how to recommend it!), but only so long as you know what to expect. You should not expect to be 'entertained,' which is not this film's main aim. The main aim is to communicate that war itself is the evil; one sees this with the deeply disturbing pain and suffering that accompanies the horrors that the film's protagonist witnesses firsthand."
Hamsvoord1,"Feb 25, 2003",7/10,"This is the only war movie which make'd me cry, there more though war movie's but this one is the hardest! Should you have some romantic view of war, this movie will end it. This movie tells the story of a boy which joins the russian partizans, it is one of the few war movie's that doesnt have glamour, there no winners in this war. The movie shows the life of Aleksei (Florya Gaishun)during the rage of the nazi's in Russia. He joins the Russian partizans against the will of his mother, from here he loses grip on things and the war is taking over his entire look on things. It is quiet clear to me that his actions where motivated by romantic views on life(and war)but the steps he took into action had shown him another thing about war and hate. This movie is the best war movie i ever seen and i saw quite a lot of them, it will change your view on war(every war). I rate this movie with ***** out of *****, the best war movie i ever seen!"
gavin6942,"Jul 29, 2013",8/10,"After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet Army and experiences the horrors of World War II.Roger Ebert called this film ""one of the most devastating films ever about anything, and in it, the survivors must envy the dead... The film depicts brutality and is occasionally very realistic, but there's an overlay of muted nightmarish exaggeration... It must unfold as a surprise for you. It pretends to roll back history. You will see how. It is unutterably depressing, because history can never undo itself, and is with us forever.""That probably sums it up. This could be considered one of the greatest war films of all time, or at the very least one of the greatest World War II films of all time. The story is gruesome and realistic, and all the more terrifying for focusing on two children rather than the world of the adults. The contrast between ""playing war"" and actually taking part in one is so strong that it may have us wondering why we ""play"" such games at all..."
qumshoe,"May 21, 2025",7/10,"This film is not great. This film is not good. I don't appreciate the fact a real cow was gunned down for the making of this filmNevertheless, it offers a real warning to the dangerous objective nature of fascism. It's history we can learn from. History that, people unfortunately tend to forget. In the face of fascism, people tend to not comprehend just how bad it is until it impacts them directly. People tend to be complacent when it happens overseas-even if facilitated by their own government. People tend to be complacent when it happens to immigrants domestically.This film greatly showcases that fascism will initially kill on the basis of discrimination, and when there is no longer anyone left to discriminate against, fascism will kill indiscriminately. Anything to justify a cause, even if based on a lie. Anyone you can direct your anger at and put at fault for the issues that exist in your world or country, in order to avoid introspection."
0w0,"Jan 28, 2020",4/10,"This movie is basically a documentary which more-or-less shows what it was like back in WW2 from the perspective of Russians. Now I can appreciate that the movie is shot in 1985 and that the director went for a very 'artistic' feel by having the camera on actors' faces for often up to 1minute at a time, but honestly the way that this film was filmed just makes it boring, not 'artistic' at all.They also killed a couple of animals in the movie, including shooting a cow and having it suffer for a while, which is something I HAVE to deduct a few rating points for... I mean, shooting an animal is absolutely fine if it was meant for slaughter in anyway, but shooting it and making it suffer is inexcusable, even if this was 1985 back when things were different, it's still not right.There's also several things in the movie that don't make sense, like at certain scenes in the movie, some actors spoke in a very very deep and rough voice, like they were told by the director ""speak like a demon would"". It makes very little sense and just confuses the hell out of the viewer.The acting is also pretty bad in a couple of scenes, particularly from the 2 main actors (the girl and the boy). I understand that it was both of their first times acting in a movie, but that doesn't excuse the bad casting choice. I mean, sure the girl is distractingly pretty, but she's a poor actor and she has no place in a movie... with her looks maybe in a magazine or pin-up poster, but not in a movie.I'd give the first half of the movie a 2/10 and the second half of the movie a 8/10. So basically, if you want to watch the movie, do yourself a favor and skip to half-way."
bordsenius,"Jul 7, 2001",10/10,"This is a film like no others.  It is horrible. Violent. Gruesome. It might make you vomit. It made me sick for  week, but I still think that it is the best movie I have ever seen. There is no graphical violence - all is in the head of the viewer.Humankind is given a big slap in the face  - this is more real than reality.So my advice is - go and see. It will not leave you untouched.My personal ""best movie ever"" prize goes to this one. I still shudder when I think about it, and It has been about 15 years since I saw it."
Cold_Aqua_Tomato,"Oct 11, 2019",10/10,"I watched this film years ago, and I'll never forget it. I'm writing the review because I've seen accusations of propaganda. Unbelievable, even though I realise most westerners are ignorant and brainwashed out of their mind. You are like those Nazis in this film justifying atrocities they commit because ""Inferior races spread the microbes of communism"".
This film is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see that will help you to start understanding what war is (hello to your ""heroes"" committing atrocities in the Middle East) and also, maybe, help you understand Russians ."
mayaschneiderbsc,"Dec 4, 2022",10/10,"There is a 1987 Japanese documentary that I watched recently by Kazuo Hara called ""The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On"". In the film, Hara follows a WW2 veteran named Kenzo Okuzaki who, 40 years after the war, is still haunted by the unexplained deaths of two soldiers in his unit. Exposing the truth and holding accountable those who were responsible became an obsession that guided his actions for the rest of his life.There are several reasons why Okuzaki agreed to do the film, but one of them was that he had hoped to show the world how un-heroic, horrifying, and inglorious war actually is. Hollywood has a tendency to portray war and the soldiers who fight as honorable, courageous, and patriotic. War is portrayed as a cause worth fighting and ostensibly dying for. In other words, we often hear only the stories people want us to hear and not the stories of what actually happened.Viewers are not often exposed to the uncomfortable and disturbing realities that both soldiers and civilians face every day out there on the front lines. Humanity, decency, and empathy are oftentimes lost as warring parties carry out their futile quest for greed, power, and control. Indeed, that is the message most anti-war films attempt to convey and Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is the most powerful example of it. In my opinion, it is not just the best anti-war movie of all time, but one of the best movies ever made. It is quite literally a masterpiece.The film takes place in 1943 Nazi-occupied Belarus with a focus on 14-year-old Flyora, a naive Belarusian teenager who is eager to join the partisan army. He is elated when he finally finds a rifle that will allow him to do so. Despite the wishes of his mother who pleads with him not to go, Flyora excitedly packs his bags grinning from ear to ear. Needless to say, it is a coming-of-age story unlike any other you've probably ever seen. His optimistic, friendly, and innocent demeanor is quickly eroded when he witnesses the sheer brutality of Nazi forces. War was not fun and games; it was horror and death. Every minute of this movie reminds us, the viewers, of that. And after watching this movie, it's a lesson you'll likely never forget.But what makes this movie even more unforgettable is its production. The film was co-written by Ales Adamovich and the story is based on his own experiences fighting alongside Belarusian partisans as a teenager. Klimov also had to fight 8 years of censorship before he was even allowed to make this movie. Aleksei Kravchenko, the teenager playing Flyora, had never acted in a film before. The expressions of shock, fear, and terror are often real, not scripted. Live rounds of ammunition were used in this film, at times passing just 4 inches above Kravchenko's head. It really was a matter of life and death for him during certain scenes of this movie. Ethics aside, nothing captures fear better on camera than people who are actually experiencing it in real-time.This isn't a movie you watch to ""enjoy"". Nothing about this film is enjoyable to watch. It's a movie you watch to experience, and it's a movie everyone should experience at least once. It is disturbing, hard to watch, it will make you uncomfortable and at times disgusted. There are no heroes here. No glory. No happy ending. This isn't your average war movie, and in fact, I'd consider it to be more of a horror movie. This is a sugar-free WW2 movie that is entirely dark, chaotic, and bleak. But that's also what makes it brutally honest in its portrayal. There is nothing romantic or cute about genocide.Come and See compels you to do just that. It's a must-see for any WW2 buff, but also for anyone who appreciates film as art. There is not a single flaw with this film. It's basically perfect. It's also one of the most accurate portrayals of Nazi crimes on the Eastern Front. It may feel uncomfortable to watch, but don't look away. Watch every single second no matter how disturbing a scene may be. Because it is a window into a past we should never return to, and as human beings we need to understand what we're capable of. We are the torturers and the tortured. The powerful and the powerless. Capable of murder, and capable of saving lives."
trav271,"Jan 17, 2025",10/10,"This is an incredible film that does a fantastic job of capturing the chaos, senselessness, and surprising results of small acts. It is that last point that resonated with me the most. As a combat vet, it always struck me the small things that would have massive effects in ways that you just would never expect. It's part of the strangeness and uncertainty of war. This film unlike any other I've seen has a brilliant piece of writing to capture that. One only needs read some of the 1 star reviews to see that if you miss this, and you have the backwards impression that this is some kind of Rambo movie, then sure I can see the bad review. Except this is a film attempting to create what war looks like. It is chaotic. It is not what most Americans fed images from Hollywood think it is. It is confusion on a massive scale. It is hysteria. It is seeing the rules and conventions of the world and people that you know vanish and attempting to understand the alien and seemingly monstrous thing unfolding before you. And this film captures that."
ozorfis,"Mar 25, 2023",10/10,"This movie occupied my mind for a long time after watching it unfold. Usually that is a good thing as it makes you reflect on the topics presented, yourself and the world in general.But this movie leaves you in utter despair and horror for days. You get physically sick from the feelings it conveys. When you realize, that it is by no means an exaggeration, but what it was like for the Belarussian people during WW2, it hits even harder. The tension between realism and surrealism invokes a sense of dissociation the protagonist might have felt at times.Every other war movie feels like a staged soap opera now, which is part of why I sometimes regret watching this movie. IF you want to know what total war feels like, this is for you."
childs_gayle_patrick,"Jun 5, 2012",10/10,"First let me say that I hate most war movies (I hate war in general actually). Most movies in this genre star handsome young charismatic Hollywood A-listers. They make it flashy and adventure full, with great catch lines. And 90 percent of them are about WWII. Alright, enough. We get it World War 2, Hitler, Mussolini, it was all bad.But then finally someone covers what happened to the Russians. The Russians suffered the most casualties of the war but yet their stories are rarely told.Cinematically, the movie is beautiful. The scene shots, long takes, the effects! Which aren't what we think of usually when one says ""FX"" because they are actually doing it! Shooting! Explosions! My film class watched it before me and they reviewed it together before me. One or two people went as far to say that after they watched it, they were deeply disturbed and it stayed with them well into the next day. I thought they were exaggerating... Until I watched it myself. I think this movie will haunt me anytime I ever think of it, from here on out.Even if war movies make you cringe, I think everyone should see this movie."
santhony-249-805196,"Feb 9, 2024",6/10,"I suspect some people may like this movie. Some will profess liking it, because they think they need to, in order to maintain their ""foreign film, art house"" credibility, but make no mistake; this is a truly awful movie.First, it's a foreign film and contains subtitles, which is never ideal, but not a deal killer if the film is actually decent. This one is not.While there are a few scenes of interest, others drag on interminably, such as when the protagonist, a young teenaged boy who is drafted into a Belorussian partisan group dances through the forest with an attractive female partisan for what seems like forever.Oh wait, that was the best part."
DraicKinn,"Nov 19, 2023",10/10,"I just had to see what all the fuss was about, and now I know why.

Surely it is not an easy one to digest, since it's not a war movie that was made to entertain you, because it neither glorifies, nor sugar-coats, nor stylizes any of the violence, and at the same time it's not overstating it. In any case, it could very well be that this is the cinematic representation of what it feels like to be in a war and how it can destroy your humanity from inside out. This is evident in the physical transformation (or deterioration) of the boy, we lose our innocence along with him, and we end up overwhelmed, fragile, hopeless and broken. And this is not the director just being cruel to the viewer, I think he masterfully makes us really see and understand that war is truly harrowing, that it's an absurd and nonsensical undertaking, that in the end nobody wins, humanity loses. It's definitely one of the most anti-war movies out there. It gave me an emotional hard blow, and it left me with a deep sense of unease, raising more questions than answers, but that's just what I think the most unforgettable films do."
mateus_bf,"Dec 10, 2020",10/10,"Idi i Smotri is a vital movie. The kind of film every human being needs to watch. It is more haunting than a horror movie because all of it happened for real. Despite the fact Flyora is a fictional character, he and his fellow citizens represent the people who suffered the atrocities commited by their own species. You don't need to focus specially on the horrors of WWII. This movie represents all the atrocities humankind has commited: the Atlantic slave trade, the indigenous genocide that occured in America, medieval Inquisition, the Bengal famine, you name it.In order for me not to mark it as a ""spoilerish"" review, the synopsis will be brief.""Come and See"" starts with Flyora, a boy who has idyllic dreams about being a soldier and fighting the war. He is extremely reprimmended by his mother. An interesting fact is that this scene, like many other scenes in the film, is made with the actor or actress talking directly to the camera. In this scene, it looks like we are Flyora and our mother is yelling at us. I believe that in this scene Elen Klimov tried to do a personal appeal at the audience, especially for people who think war is nice and ""glorious"". We are the immature kid who wanna go out make some war and the mother is Klimov, pleading for us not to do so.In the end it was in vain. Two army officials get inside the house and take him out anyway. What happens next you will only find out watching the movie.Something I really like about the movie is that the director didn't cut it much. Some shots can last as long as 2-3 minutes. This is vital if the author is trying to put a sense of realism in the picture, and it served the purpose very well. Some movies nowadays are so hasty that the directors simply cannot stop cutting them, like a real butcher. For me, a Tarkovsky fan, finding a movie with longer shots is glorious.In the end, what I believe the author is trying to tell us is, despite the fact humankind has achieved some impressive levels of cruelty and savagery during the course of history, we cannot by all means lose our hope in that same humankind. We have the capacity for evilness, but also a lot of capacity for kindness and compassion, and we must not abandon our sense human dignity if we are to continue our journey into this absurd world.P.S.: watched the movie a couple months ago, so not a fresh review. I don't think it matters, actually, because movies like these are not easy to forget."
nathanjcarpenter-70529,"Jul 24, 2021",10/10,Easily one of the best war films ever made. Come and See presents a level of realism and authenticity that is rarely seen in historical movies. The film truly lived up to the praise I heard about it before watching. Easily the most terrifying part about the movie is that it actually happened.
BeneCumb,"Apr 13, 2018",6/10,"The film is ""old"" and I am pretty sure I had not seen it in my youth, but for a change - and based on good ratings here - I decided to find necessary 2+ hours... And obtained mixed feelings.True, it is rather atypical Soviet film about war, reflective and running its course, without constant shootings and explosions, with religious elements. The leading character/performance is great, often ""too much"" - in a sense that all other characters are too minor and supporting, less than e.g. Belarusian nature which wildness and emptiness provide additional value (btw, periphery villages in Belarus look almost the same as in the film, with minor technical accessories visible).On the other hand, one should bear in mind that this film was made before perestroika. thus all atrocities in the WW II were committed by Nazis only - so the Soviet people were told and that we see in the film. There is nothing about Soviet partisans stealing and plundering, confiscating properties, killing countrymen for living further in occupied territories, etc. Thus, in reality, Idi i smotri provides rather lopsided picture what was going on in those turbulent times and can be regarded a great work in terms of visual only."
TarkovskyWorld,"Jan 17, 2024",N/A,"This movie completely destroyed me. Even knowing that it was a war or anti-war film, nothing could prepare me for the more than two hours of brutality it contains.From those first moments with an innocent Florya playing at war, I was destroyed. A child who thinks with all his innocence that he is going to fight for his country, without thinking that in less than a week he would be totally corrupted by the things he would see and have to suffer firsthand.This is one of those movies that undoubtedly makes you think a lot. Showing how brutal, lethal, apathetic and cruel human beings can be.Without a doubt a masterpiece, a complete and undoubted 10."
Andrew426,"Mar 8, 2023",9/10,"Trust the Russians to make one of the most miserable films ever made! I was told horror stories about Come and See - how it was one of the most harrowing and brutal films ever, how it superseded most horror films, and how it left its actors in a state of trauma after filming. It is no surprise the director retired from filmmaking after this one - there really was nothing left to make. What could you make after? A romcom?Unlike films such as All Quiet on the Western Front, perhaps the most recent example of a grim anti-war film, the horrors of CaS aren't as in your face as the latter. It is a much grimier, slow burner that allows its grim imagery to seep into your skin, exemplified further by the fact that real life consequences came from many scenes. Live rounds were used during filming and the cow we see in the film really was shot to death. Nasty stuff.Apart from a few others, Aleksei Kravchenko may be one of the greatest child actors of the century. His performance trumps most adults of the film industry. We see how the turmoils of war slowly deteriorate this poor child, and I've never seen trauma so effectively depicted visually before. By the end of the film, Fliora looks about 3 decades older, a consequence of all the horrible tribulations he was succumbed to.This film is not a dramatization in any sense, just pure, raw, blunt trauma. There are no heroes, everyone is a monster and everyone suffers. This is NOT a fun watch, but perhaps one that still needs to be seen to really hammer in that basic message that war is hell and nothing more."

myboigie,"Dec 11, 2005",10/10,"Forget ""Saving Private Ryan"", this is the real-story of who fought and suffered the most during-WWII: ethnic-Slavs within the Soviet Union. Most Westerners have little-or-no idea about what the Russian-front was and what it means in the scope of human-history. Centered mostly around the experiences of a young Byelorussian-peasant, this is what war is. Klimov stated in interviews before his passing that a number of elements came from his own experiences, and that he left-out many horrors that were even-worse. Like Iraq, the invasion of the Soviet Union was passed-off as a ""preemptive"" strike to stop ""Bolshevik-terrorists"", when it was really about creating a German settler-state that had been wiped-clean of Slavs by the Einsatzgruppe. SS units often razed entire villages, leaving nobody alive. We see a bit of this early-on in the film when the young-Byelorussian returns to his village--to the sound of buzzing-flies. All of this was necessary to the National Socialist-hierarchy to pay-off reckless loans that were the backbone of the Nazi ""economic-miracle"". Taking territory, and exploiting it was the only way Hitler and the Nazis had to do this. There is a similar-dynamic to American-involvement in Iraq, right-now. Proportionally, we are doing the same-thing, for the same-reasons. Not all films are for entertainment, and Klimov wanted us to remember so there wouldn't be another ""Operation Barbarossa"".Klimov shows us that depopulation, and genocide was the reality on-the-ground, and this created megadeaths on both-sides due to the chaos of death-on-death, a terrifying chain-reaction. An unspoken, ""take-no-prisoners"" policy became a reality on both-sides due to Nazi-brutality. As-many as 28 million Slavs were annihilated by Hitler's policy of ""lebensraum""(living-space). It is saddening that a film like this stands-out--we should not be shielded-from the realities of war, we should see it all so we know what war really is. This film captures the strange-beauty of chaos, too. There are moments that are shockingly-beautiful, even in war, which should give us pause. It is true that Klimov had his extras under the fire of real-bullets, which is crucial, and stunning. This was actually done in the early Warners gangster films, like ""Public Enemy Number One""! Nobody will ever know how truly-horrible it all was, and yet, it is hardly ever noted in the mainstream of Western culture. We should be ashamed of the Cold War for this, alone.Director Klimov was a unique director in the Soviet system, a genuine maverick with a vision of history as fateful. This is what makes him one of the finest of Russian-filmmakers, because he strikes upon what is important to the Russian-experience; the ""Slavic-condition"", if I may be so bold. It says a lot that this was Klimov's final-film, and that he felt he had said all he needed to as a Russian-director. It is an amazing-testament, too, to what was actually possible under the Soviet system, it contradicts what we think we ""know"" about it. Are films not truncated, buried and suppressed in our system, economically? Definitely. Are/were we so very different? The human-condition is often a distressing one, and history should make us more-wary of violence of any-sort. Violence never solves a problem, it merely creates more of them. Boring-cynics will say this is not-possible, but there have been centuries of peace in human-history before. Watch this film, and ask yourself if you would like to be in-the-middle of a war.1.21.06-PS: As the situation deteriorates in Iraq, and the President continues to spy-on Americans, we should be learning from a film like this--liberty is hard-won, and there is a price-to-pay. Can we avoid war? I think so, and it will be hard-work, but a way to honor the war-dead."
sstransam209,"Jun 11, 2008",8/10,"This is one of those rare situations where you can't really tell how you feel. Throughout this whole movie we continually get slapped kicked and punched by our emotions. There is no possible way we can all feel like the character in this movie, or even try to understand what he is going through. But if there was one possible way for the director to make us feel what he felt the director provided it for us, If there was one, and only one way for the movie to be directed and it definitely did that. There were points in the movie to where I had to turn my face away because the cruelty was just too much. He didn't even have to tells us, hey look at what these people did don't you hate them. NO he just told the story from a totally subjective view and sat back and let us draw our own conclusions."
malloryelo,"Jan 31, 2022",10/10,"There are very few movies that I find to be so good that I can't watch it over and over again. Typically when I find a movie that is very well made, I hyper-fixate on it and I watch it as many times as I can. However, I do not feel the inclination to watch this movie numerous times solely due to the fact that I felt like I was experiencing the film and it's contents myself. The actors of this movie endured such a harsh experience on set and I find it to be very admirable. The writers of this movie added such a visceral, deep-seated meaning message. The movie's visuals were so graphic, that it seemed as though it was real. This movie does such a good job at using symbolism and cinematography to depict such a touchy subject in the most upmost way."
Muelko,"Sep 23, 2022",9/10,"Oh gosh... It's. It's that kind of movie where you just don't want to say or do anything after watching it. You just want to be quiet. And listen. And immerse in the images which you just saw. It's a heartbreaking movie. And in its rawness very realistic and just... it's just sad. All of these things happened in the movie. It's a tough movie to watch. Absolutely. Don't watch it like whatever I'm gonna watch a movie, yay. No. Take your time, sit back, listen... and watch. And it will be one of the most disturbing experiences you will ever see. But it is important to watch it. Because things like this are... just not acceptable. What a brilliance of a movie."
dubbs37,"Jun 2, 2012",3/10,"In recently becoming interested in films and mini-series centered on fictitious or historical characters in World War II, I ran across this title on several top 50 or 100 war films lists. I was rather keen to see it, especially given the reviews which called it ""chilling"" or lauded it as one of the top war films of all time. Forgive me for being a killjoy here, but after viewing this film, I was simply left with a feeling of ""Really?"". The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called ""intense"" scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character. Some scenes also appeared to drag on too long without any meaning or added effect. In short, I would probably put this on my ""Top 50 War Films to Pass On"" list. I should have simply watched another coming-of-age war film that is an outstanding film: ""Europa Europa."""
loricossette-20061,"Oct 4, 2019",10/10,"I really struggle to find words to describe this film. Brutal, affecting, savage, realistic and incredibly disturbing come to mind. This is the most powerful war film I have ever seen. I will not watch more than once, I cannot. But all people should see it once, and war will never be glorified again. My God."
nerfmemusique,"Nov 1, 2021",10/10,"Not a big fan of old movies, but this is easily the best war movie our species has produced. It's also the best horror movie I've seen. Unadulterated horror. The cinematography is genius. The acting is perfect. I was really shocked that I had never seen this until recently.It will make you laugh, cry, and induce terror, and that terror part is a big deal, because modern audiences are desensitized, and yet still it horrified me. I mean, I'm the kind of dude that laughs at horror movies, watching them at night in the dark, and falling asleep peacefully soon after. Not with this one. This scarred me."
jcjohnston1-1,"May 22, 2019",10/10,"Other reviewers have pretty much said all that needs to be said about the movie so I'll offer my experience.I watched this with English subtitles so I don't feel like I got the 10 out of 10 experience.I'm also not sure what rating to give it. It clearly deserves a 10 out of 10, but at the same time it's such an assault on your senses that it's almost un-watchable. And it's a long movie. I had to watch it in two parts over two evenings. I couldn't handle the whole movie in one sitting. I felt like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Throughout the entire movie I never stopped thinking, ""What the F#ck?"" because everything the Nazis did was What The F#ck. Schindler's List was an assault on your heart. Come and See is an assault on your mind. The protagonist lives from one WTF moment to the next and you wonder how anyone wouldn't lose their mind. I kept thinking, ""What the f#ck am I watching? What the f#ck is going on?"", which was clearly the protagonist's state of mind.The movie's message to me: The Nazis turned Belarus into an insane asylum. A madhouse.You have to watch this movie."
mona_tabet,"Dec 17, 2007",N/A,"I have to say, I was not crazy about watching this film. I don't normally like war movies. This one was particularly painful to watch because it was so very real. Having grown up in a war zone, I was taken back to those days. I knew the look in Florya's eyes. I had seen it in the eyes of people I grew up with. I recognized his responses, as they were so very similar to the ones taken by the survivors around me. I felt the heaviness in the atmosphere, felt the moments laden with life or death for simple actions. Not many words in this film, yet so expressive. It takes you into the life of a young adolescent and you get to live his life and the horrors that he goes through. You see him age before your very eyes. It's not about the physical aspects of war, not about the artillery, the noise, the heroes, but its effects on the soul. That's what stays with you."
niktrik,"Sep 25, 2022",10/10,"This movie stays faithful to the morals of Soviet union art school and that is Realism ...

It gives a real taste of the crimes have been done to the soviet people
( specific to Belarus ) from Nazis .It contents raw scenes materialised from the real horror the book writer ( which the movies is based ) had experienced first ...
This is not a Hollywood movie were the heroes kill thousands with a glance
This is reality movie where the heroes-victims are the native / indigenous people , the big victims of any war .... and a war is the living hell for them .A simple well orchestrated movie that hits the point of every war ....From a formal -photography point .This movie plays at the highest levels of art .Included the real sound of canons that brings the content nearer to true nature of this war ."
ExpendableMan,"Jul 25, 2021",9/10,"'Come And See' is excellent, but it's a film you'll only want to watch once. Set in Belarus during the height of the Second World War, it follows Fliora Gayshun (Aleksey Kravchenko), a young lad who digs up a buried rifle and then joins a local partisan group. Almost immediately, things take a dark turn and Fliora finds himself neck deep in the horrors of war. It's an incredibly harsh and unforgiving movie, but it's also deeply involving and arguably one of the greatest ever made.What makes it so compelling is that this isn't a blood and thunder epic with a focus on combat. The actual battle scenes are few and when they do occur, there's no 'Hacksaw Ridge' style choreographed violence, just people huddling in the dirt, praying that the bullets fired by unseen assailants pass them overhead. In fact, for a sizeable part of the running time, you don't see much of the German war machine at all, bar a lone spotter plane circling overhead. The Belarus countryside seems big and largely empty, with only the occasional farmstead to raid. The lead character doesn't even fire his weapon until the very last minutes, and even then he's shooting into a puddle.Instead of combat, the film focuses more on the atrocities committed against the civilian population and it is genuinely horrific. Characters stumble across piles of corpses covered in flies, psychotic soldiers laugh maniacally as families are burned alive and screaming, desperate women are dragged naked into trucks full of baying men. You don't always see the horror unfold, but the intentions are clear. It's a deeply unsettling vision of hell on earth and will be etched in your brain long after the credits roll.A huge amount of credit has to go to the leading man. Kravchenko was only a teenager when this was made, with next to no prior acting experience, but he is remarkable. A lot of the horrors take place offscreen, but they leave an impact because of the young lead's response to them. His wide eyes and haunted expression leave no doubt about the pyschological damage he's endured. He starts off as an optimistic lad, excited by the prospect of a big adventure but two hours later he's a broken, shell of his former self.Coupled with this is an effective thousand-hornet soundtrack that makes the empty landscape and distant warplanes seem surreal and otherworldly. 'Come And See' takes the madness-inducing aspect of war, makes the crimes against humanity the forefront and the end result is one of the most effecting WW2 films to precede 'Schindler's List.' It's a masterpiece, but it's very difficult to watch and sitting through it more than once will be a challenge for even the most hardened war-movie fan."
melahndoestherobot,"Jun 9, 2008",10/10,"Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is one of the most horrifying war movies you will ever see, and it is a film that will affect you emotionally and physically in a way that few movies ever will. The film follows 12-year-old Florya (executed brilliantly by newcomer Alexei Kravchenko), who anxiously awaits life as a soldier for the Russian Army in 1943 Byelorussia. However his fantasy rapidly comes to an end as he comes face to face with the brutal realities of war and bears witness to some of the most terrible atrocities imaginable. The film relies heavily around haunting images and sound, and Klimov so vividly portrays Florya's descent into madness that by the end of the film we ourselves feel as though we have lost our minds. Though emotionally draining, it is a very moving and powerful film well worth seeing, that will without a doubt stay with you for years to come."
sdkfz1822002,"Dec 6, 2007",6/10,"As a war film it was a nice change from the more Western variety I usually see. Good compositions of war's surreal nature and the consistent style of camera work in showing reactions and not the source was a good touch. What special effects that were used- not so good. But the explosions were first-rate.I guess I was expecting a Peckinpah-esquire twist on ""Cross of Iron."" What I got was the tired Germans bad, Soviets good theme. The Russian perspective on Partisan warfare and its consequences was nice, however. Let's just not forget the Soviet's rampage through Eastern Europe soon after. -Guess that wouldn't make as entertaining a movie."
jgcorrea,"Jun 23, 2024",6/10,"I love the slow-paced films of Antonioni, Ozu and Bresson, so I'm not impatient. I also love entertaining movies. Or shocking. Or thought-provoking. This is so tedious it feels like the director is calling the viewer's bluff. War atrocities are horrific and disgusting, but this attempt at shock is ridiculous when compared to the real atrocities of post-war Russians.. I'm indeed picking the Allied side to the war, and just focusing on the hypocrisy of the movie. There are many better shows about WWII. I'm standing out from the applauding crowd on this. Poor acting, poor direction, too slow, lacking content and with an obsession with reusing the same image over and over."

And NO MUSIC except in the last minutes.The last half hour could be considered a higher 6/10, but the people giving this a 10/10 must have seriously been drunk or high to give such a rating."

EvelynBuijs,"Nov 16, 2022",10/10,"Never before have I felt the urge to write a review for a movie I watched, but this movie manages to take the cake. It is a genuine 2 hour and 22 minute horror movie, but not in the way you'd expect.This movie hardly ever feels like a movie. There's no big fantastic set pieces, there's no big names. It's purely real. This movie isn't about characters or heroes fighting against a big evil antagonist. It's about real people struggling in dire times. And it manages to portray this in such a terrifying way, that I can safely say this movie made me hate nazis more than i already did.Minor spoilers ahead:
If it weren't for the live cow they killed specifically for this movie, I'd say it deserves all awards, however apparenlty that cow that was shot on screen, was actually shot with live rounds. Which uhhh.. Though I get that it was necessary to capture the horror the main character was experiencing, I just feel bad for the cow :("

It is a story with a very human perspective that is impacted by war.I still remember stumbling out of the cinema after seeing it in 1986 - grateful for the normality of life.Sadly it came to mind from the war in Ukraine. We still have not learnt..
Go and see - and hopefully learn."

rchase-2,"May 1, 2001",N/A,"Have been showing classic films to teenagers for eight years and I've found no other film that leaves such a strong emotional impact on them. Their reaction is mainly due to it's subjective, vivid use of visuals, and its technique of showing war through a young person's eyes.  I've found no other film about WW2 so compelling.  Film seems to have had an big influence on Speilberg, especially the more dynamic sequences of Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Ryan's ""going deaf"" sequence (losing the sound) was probably lifted from this film.(a hommage?)  Highly recommended for bright young students who need an emotional high and need to become excited about dynamic film-making. It's harrowing- as anti-war films should be. Even better, it squashes thoroughly all romantic, heroic ideas about war."
NewFilmStudent,"Jun 8, 2008",7/10,"This film showed the brutal reality of what war really is. It is frustrating to see how many lives are taken unnecessarily with out any remorse. And unfortunately to see a young boy's dream to be a good soldier for his country be trampled on. Florya gets a rude awakening when he experiences what war is really about and to see all the death at a very young age. Even though some scenes in the film are graphic, the director did a great job in making the death seem so real that as if you could actually smell the blood. The film was raw and making scenes so traumatic that they become embedded in your mind. Also the use of long continuous time takes allowed some scenes to be even more intense, for example when Florya and Glasha are in the mud pool and to see their struggle, their expressions made it even more real that it made you want help to pull them out. This film definitely makes the point across that it's not about the plot, but of the horrors of war. But to also see how young Florya aged through the film was amazing. To see his innocence in the beginning of the film and by the end it has diminished. War has literally stolen the life out of him. This film is brutal, raw but definitely amazing. Highly recommend"
petroxar,"Nov 14, 2025",10/10,"Idi I smotri...""Come and See"" is an epic must seen,nightmarish descent into the horrors of war, seen through the eyes of a Belarusian boy whose innocence is shattered by brutality. Elem Klimov crafts a surreal, almost hallucinatory experience where sound, silence, and distorted imagery pull the viewer into a living hell. The film's emotional intensity grows relentlessly, culminating in scenes that are both devastating and unforgettable. More than a war film, it's a profound meditation on trauma, humanity, and the cost of violence-one of cinema's most powerful and essential works."
mrethanfalk,"Dec 13, 2011",7/10,"""Come and See"" was a film in which I really had trouble watching and enjoying. It goes without saying though that Elem Klimov deserves to be praised for his brilliant film-making. He was really able to effectively encapsulate this tragic event through the use of disturbing sounds and horrifying visuals, though it's a movie that would pain me to sit through again. It's one thing to remember and reflect on brutal, historical events, but to be involved in them first hand(which is what the movie essentially does to you), is truly overwhelming for the psyche. A film like ""Schindler's List,"" on the other hand, is something I can sit through several times without feeling as 'mentally abused.' I recognize that this was exactly what Klimov wanted to evoke in me. His intentions were geared towards having me take part in this war alongside the films protagonist Florya. The film forces you to use all of your senses, making it a truly disturbing 2 1/2 hour journey."

There is nothing fun, nothing really funny about this movie. Although I did find my self laughing at the brutish stupidity of some of the characters. The constant close ups are exclusively chilling, even when the are smiling and having a brief moment of happiness you feel the sinister undertones. This is all set to constant music, not necessarily with instruments or a band but with words and horrible actions. It all builds up to one of the most dramatic conclusions of any movie."

luisfelipeqr,"Jul 20, 2025",10/10,"Come and See is not just a film - it's an unflinching descent into the horrors of war, told with such raw power and intensity that it leaves a permanent mark on the viewer. Elem Klimov's direction is extraordinary, guiding the story with masterful control as it slowly builds from quiet unease to sheer psychological devastation. The cinematography is stunning and haunting - every frame feels meticulously crafted, yet terrifyingly real. The camera often lingers uncomfortably long, forcing us to confront the brutality head-on.The realism is almost unbearable. Through the eyes of a young boy, we witness the complete breakdown of innocence and humanity in the face of unspeakable violence. What starts as a seemingly simple coming-of-age story turns into a nightmarish journey through the atrocities of Nazi occupation. The film has no interest in glamorizing or sanitizing war - instead, it strips everything down to show it for what it really is: inhumane, chaotic, and soul-crushing.One of the film's greatest strengths is its pacing and how tension grows relentlessly. It dares to show the psychological damage inflicted not just on soldiers, but on civilians - especially children. Without fear or compromise, it presents some of the most disturbing images ever put to film, yet nothing feels gratuitous. Every scene serves the purpose of truth.Few films are as emotionally overwhelming or as artistically brilliant. Come and See is cinema at its most powerful - a brutal, essential experience that reminds us why war should never be forgotten, let alone repeated. One of the greatest films ever made."
tonypeacock-1,"Feb 27, 2025",8/10,"I went into viewing this film totally blind somewhat to its significance and popularity amongst the cinephile community and finished totally aghast at what I had just viewed, much more as an anti-war film than other films I had watched on the subject such as All Quiet On The Western Front (both versions).You see what struck me watching this film was just how gritty and real it was being a Soviet Union era production (Mosfilm) set in the Belarus area during the Second World War, 1943. However the low budget eastern bloc filming facilities did not affect the camera work, sound or performances at all.The film has graphic sequences that show a young teenager being aged by the horrors he sees during the Nazi occupation of Byelorussia as it was. Belarus now. From playing like a young child on a beach and finding a rifle at the start of the film the central character Flyora (Aleksei Kravchenko) joins the Belarussian Partisan Resistance leaving his family in the process, who are later killed in a Nazi purge of their village and observing the destruction of another village later in the film that is one of the most horrific scenes in a Second World War film I have seen.Intertwined we observe and hear the deafness Flyora suffers after a Nazi air raid with scenes of psychosis as Flyora meets a teenage girl called Glasha. You literally see Flyora aging as he sees the horrors of the conflict (make-up I presume?).The film shows historical footage of Adolf Hitler (complete with marches, ceremonies and his rise to power in Germany in the 1930s) towards the end in rewind as Flyora shoots a Hitler Liberation poster. The footage ends as we see a baby Hitler being cradled by his mother.The film displays that some 600 or so Belarus villages were destroyed in such a way as seen in the film. Horrifying, but all to relevant with conflicts elsewhere in the region today perhaps?"
MariaXtinaBenthall,"Jul 25, 2011",9/10,"There is this one shot in ""Come and See"" where Florya, the movie's main character steps on a nest of eggs and we are shown this short shot of dead wet chicks in the middle of the mud moss. This tiny maybe 3second shot was so unbelievably powerful I felt sick for the next ten minutes. I watched an interview with Director Elem Klimov after I watched the movie. There was no way that the male actor that played Florya was mentally stable after such a horrific journey of war in this movie - Klimov explained that he used hypnosis during filming to make sure the actors were not affected. It made me think how different the movie would be if it was made in now time - there would be restrictions, laws and Klimov would have probably had to restrain his creative urges. The other thing Klimov mentioned in the interview was that the movie was originally going to be called ""Kill Hitler"" - Hitler standing for your inner demons. This theme that every one has a Hitler inside them that they fight constantly every day. Each person with a different battle. ""Come and See"" is literally a descent to hell. It is the only war movie where I have wholly felt like I was there - experiencing this horrific real war time of Nazi hell. Klimov gives us this microscopic view - He shows us the scale of things and the reality check that war is for small villages. By the end of the movie we are shown that it is the rag tag armies of these villages who are the ones that defeated the Nazis. It was bizarre to me how I felt a sense of hope through this revelation at the end. When Mozart's ""Requiem"" is playing at the end and we are shown this shot of just snow I felt this huge sense of relief. The fact that there were no humans or any man-made object in the shot, just snow, made me feel like finally I could breathe. Rebirth. A new beginning. Another chance at life. My favorite aspect of the movie was the use of sound. The music was an interesting choice - Mozart is most often looked at as beautiful and calming which is the complete opposite of what is depicted in the movie. My personal association with Mozart was also peaceful and it bothered me when I realized Mozart's music was being used through this heart-wrenching sick war movie. About three quarters of the way through, I realized it was probably Mozart that got me through the movie - That helped me through war. There was also this very small and constant sound of a buzzing fly - I was constantly irritated by this. I know this is what Klimov was aiming for and so I applaud him for the effect but I felt like shooting someone myself! Klimov's bravery as a Director was phenomenal. There was no fear of the truth and there was no fear in shoving the truth down the viewer's throat. We are taken on a journey with Florya - Klimov gives his character a huge arch and by the end we too like Florya feel a reason to fight - a reason to join - an explanation of what victory is. I would recommend this movie for the tough-hearted or anyone that is searching for the truth of our world."
casperbf24,"Jan 18, 2022",10/10,"It's now been two days since, I watched this... It really left me speechless, and I just couldn't get it out of my mind...Personally I have never been affected by a film in this way before, and this is maybe the best film, I have ever watched.It's an anti-war film, that displays the pure brutality of war in a disturbing and realistic way. I would say, it has one of the best soundtracks ever with so well done sound design. Aleksei Kravchenko acting is flawless, and the whole cast masters there roles. The actors' horrific facial expressions are honestly haunting, and it makes the audience uncomfortable in a perfect way. The imagery and cinematography are evocative and powerful. With so masterly done POV-shots and dreamlike camerawork. This is cinema, at it's finest in my opinion and the director Elem Klimov truly made an almost flawless film.This is a must watch and a MASTERPIECE..."
isabelfrost,"Jun 9, 2008",7/10,"This film was truly unlike any film I have ever seen. This Great European ""Auteur"" was a heart- wrenching coming of age story of a boy Florya; from leaving his mother to joining the partisan soldiers to falling in love. Florya starts off as a boy playing in the sand looking for guns yet as the movie progresses he has to use the gun for more then just play. The aging of Florya can be seen on the boys face through out the movie and is made even more apparent with close up shots of Florya staring straight into the camera. The camera movements can be disconcerting but it only adds to the emotions running rampant within Florya. He seems to almost go crazy at points. This movie left me in a quite shock. Its images where haunting and powerful."
Enesy_1907,"Jul 3, 2025",10/10,"It carries all the familiar elements of Russian cinematography. Village, wooden houses, poverty, forest, swamp, dirt. It reminds me of Tarkovsky. As the movie begins, we find ourselves among people experiencing hell on earth. In Belarus. I can say that it was the most realistic Second World War movie I have ever watched. Pain, sorrow and tears. The struggle for existence of a nation whose right to live and freedom has been taken away. It is also a movie that makes people feel ashamed of their humanity. It is also extremely ironic that Germans describe themselves as a modern, developed society. At best, this would be barbarism, and it is. The movie is a tense drama. While watching, I couldn't breathe easily even for a second. A must watch. It should even be brought to the attention of the unintelligent Nazi-admiring masses, just like in Clockwork Orange."
CinemaSerf,"Sep 3, 2023",7/10,"This has got to be the perfect antidote to the Hollywood treatment of a war film. It's bleak, grim and repulsive - and all in a great, intentional, cinematographic fashion. The thread centres around the young ""Flyora"" (a superb effort from Aleksey Kravchenko) who is taken from his Belorussian family farm at gunpoint (along with anything it's possible to eat) by the invading Nazi troops. What now ensues follows this young man as he escapes his captors, finds an old rifle and determines to join up with the communists who are fighting almost insurmountable odds to thwart their encroaching, heavily armed, foe. What really resonates here is the simplicity of the production. There are no specials effects, no CGI to create many when there are few - it tells the simplest of stories in a manner that is truly brutal at times, then truly evocative at others. Man's inhumanity to man and all that - but writ large and depicting an invading army devoid of any semblance of humanity on just about every level. The experiences of this young man are truly horrific, but the presentation here is not especially graphic - though it's not for the faint hearted. We are shown what is happening, but Elem Klimov leaves plenty of scope for our own imagination to augment, if that is actually possible, the true grotesqueness of war, of random killings and destruction and all quite possibly exacerbated by the fact that the conquerors had no real idea what they were doing, or why - the film almost imbues them with the characteristics of the wildest of animals who enjoy their regime of torture and malevolence for the sake of it. The ending has a certain degree of vindication about it - but oddly enough it's not especially satisfying. The emotional exhaustion of the viewer has long since set in, and the true fate of what I can only really call these uniformed bullies is just, yet somehow inadequate. The film is gently paced, it could almost be a video diary as young ""Flyora"" meets and hides from those he encounters and we share his fears and risks en route. This is really well worth a watch but it's not an easy one."
robert-edquist,"Jan 13, 2021",4/10,"There is much to learn about the atrocities of WWII, but it can not be learned from this film. This film appears to want to be artistic and make a point, I don't understand why it is placed among the best, brute force can't be used to convey tragedy. It could have said much more with less, the length would have benefited from some serious editing.It was very hard to watch, not due to the difficulty so much of the brutality of the events depicted rather due to the relentless overacting and completely unnatural performances of the actors. The actors over the top acting and expressions make it appear as the characters are psychotic in almost every scene, and the camera is often positioned right in front of their faces."
Yobyoni,"Dec 9, 2019",10/10,"This is perhaps the most horrific, gripping movie I have ever seen and the best war movie I've ever seen. It painfully displays the harsh reality of war and is not afraid to shy away from every detail.This movie is not an easy watch but will keep you glued to the screen, even during the most disturbing parts.It has been more than a day since I watched the film and still hasn't left my mind, which has to justify exactly how impactful this movie has been to me, even as someone who does not particularly enjoy the majority of war films.To conclude, I definitely rank this among my top 10 movies of all time, although I most likely won't want to rewatch it any time soon."
david-byrne,"Dec 20, 2011",10/10,"Rarely does a film like this come along. In fact, it puts a whole new dimension in film making. Although the film starts out somewhat slow, the viewer is immersed into the realism of rural life and partisans in Belorussia during WW2. As the film evolves, the viewer experiences to some extent the bleakness created by the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The bleakness suddenly turns to chaos and then a level of brutality only a Hun could be proud of, where all senses of morality and decency are absent. The acting in superb, even down to the facial expressions of the partisans. Rarely do you find such fine acting, even in the West. But of course one must consider most of actors would be well educated in the Nazi occupation of Belorussia and the evil unleashed from the monsters who killed off a third of the population of Belorussia. A sense of anger and even hopelessness is felt watching this intense war film. The film exposes in a very bad light another chapter of German crimes against humanity few in the West have learned of, crimes for which Germany can never repay now or in the future. The camera work is brilliant in the film, where the bleakness is highlighted in dull tones throughout. I would strongly advise children do not watch this film - it is simply too disturbing, to the extent it makes Saving Private Ryan look like a G-rated cartoon show. Even adults with a conscience would have difficulty coming to terms with the brutality of war as shown in this film. I suggest too the viewer researches further the German atrocities in Russia in World War 2."
nqure,"Mar 1, 2007",9/10,"Gripping, harrowing portrayal of Nazi atrocities in Belarus during WW2 - a film full of startling imagery and sound (the buzzing of flies when Alexei returns to his village with Glasha), the sound of German folk music and accordions amidst manic laughter as Nazi soldiers (and their Belarussian collaborators) torch a barn full of desperate villagers.The film's greatest achievement lies in conveying a hellish world with a nightmarish poetic quality (Alexis & Glasha struggling through a marsh bog, dolls lying grotesquely on the floor of a hut as if they have been machine-gunned) but our horror is only intensified by the fact that what we witness - through the eyes of Alexis as he journeys from wide-eyed recruit to a young man aged by what he has seen - actually happened.Too many films take an almost 'pornographic' PlayStation view of war - WW2 was a war waged against civilians and 'Come & See' is a grim, savage as well as truthful account of man's inhumanity to man."
Artimidor,"Apr 20, 2013",10/10,"The horror first rears its ugly head only in the corner of an eye in Elem Klimov's shocking WW II masterpiece. Almost as if it isn't real, just an illusion, a dark thought, maybe an omen, but nothing more - how could years and years of family and village life be torn away in the maelstrom of one disturbing instance? This particular shot lasts only a moment, just one character observes the irrevocable truth and there are no words to describe it. By not talking about it maybe it will all be muted, made untrue forever - for that one person and for everyone. But the brutal war reality that strikes a young Belorussian boy and his girlfriend doesn't stop at that, it is merely beginning...""Come and see"", a passage from the ""Book of Revelations"", is indeed an apt title for a film that makes it clear that the end of the world as we know it has come upon us: Welcome to the theater of war, to the shocking and unremitting images of the horsemen of the apocalypse sweeping over Belarus as if there is no tomorrow. ""If we show the brutal truth, people won't see the film,"" Klimov warned his writer Ales Adamovich, but got countered with: ""This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace."" Klimov himself didn't make another film after this one. He said it all here. Right. As this is not a film about soldiers fighting bravely and earning their medals, a tragic story with an optional melancholic undertone to it that makes you sigh and move on. This picture is about the innocent victims, the shameless atrocities committed to them, the dilemma of the few survivors who are forced to fight for their mere existence. This is the unvarnished documentation of a nightmare, shot in earthy tones between beautiful idyll and the grisly aesthetics of war. It is merciless, haunting, traumatizing, not to be forgotten. With non-professionals in the lead Klimov uses close-ups upon close-ups to get in their eyes, the mirrors of their souls, where unparalleled devastation lingers. Come and see the raw cataclysm of a doomed generation living not too long ago, back then when the unspeakable happened, still present in the corner of your eye. Be prepared."
LeonOriginal,"Nov 2, 2017",N/A,"Only thing this movie is good at is violence. It is boring, not so well made movie about war. Yes, there is the terror, yes there is some drama, but done in such a boring way you feel like you could just walk away from it all and everything would be just fine. I don't understand the hype, but as a trend follows, foreign movies tend to get good reviews mostly because of patronizing commentators, who want to seem smart and profound.Boring, low-quality overrated garbage. And there is this constant babble about how Hollywood can't make this. Hollywood is not always at it's best, but we all know it can surpass this crap by a mile anytime. Shindler's list, for example, is way better than this. This is waste of time, with good promo story. One of them is, that kid acting went back to school with gray hair. Oh give me a break will ya'.Don't believe hype about everything. There is a reason this crap of a movie is not so well known. The most horrible things are faces, that are made to look almost like in a horror flick. Yes, war can be horror, but movies that rely on brutality are usually crap and achieve their impact through gore and violence. There is much more impact behind deep storytelling than this.Intermezzo: When you watch reviews you see many saying ""he actually walked through mud to film this"", while no one says SHE DID TOO.Crap on crap is crap. This movie is brutal, boring crap. And playing Mozart in the background is beyond stupid since it is only for molesting viewer. No Mozart is playing in the real world and no sinister sound is in the background. To get real feel set this to mute in every mayor scene. Not that big of an impact. Only well brutal with horror soundtrack in the background. With that music, baking chocolate chip cookies can look as a deepest horror flick ever."
wade-kayleigh,"Jun 5, 2012",10/10,"The fact that my professor kept on assuring my class that we would never forget this film became worrisome at some point. Why was I not going to forget this movie? Was it scary? Would I not be able to sleep that night? The answer to the last two questions was yes, and the answer to the first was because it would truly be the most unforgettable film that I would ever see up to that point. The anxiety and depression that I experienced after the film was unbelievable-how could a film stir such a reaction from a person? I was in tears as I told my mother about the film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for several days, and I couldn't get Mozart's Requiem out of my head for a while. Viewing this film truly requires and demands the implementation of all 5 senses and more. It is the most effective and realistic war film that I have ever seen, and I feel that every person who is considering joining the armed forces should watch it."
marina_hnry,"Feb 10, 2012",7/10,"After you see the first couple of scenes of this film you wonder if you are watching the work of a surrealist. The story fragments do not seem to connect and the characters are hardly appealing or even understandable. However as the film moves on the story emerges. The film is set in German occupied Russia in 1943. A young boy joins the partisans but is deafened and disorientated by a bombing attack. He wanders around moving towards his own village. Around him moves a group of German SS troops leaving carnage as they massacre the women children and elderly men in the villages. You do not see the Germans till the last part of the film but their presence is everywhere.The climax of the film is his meeting with the SS unit as it moves into and destroys a village. In the end the film is one of the most gripping and realistic portraits of war ever made. The film has no heroes, there is no message yet the film captures you in its intensity. None of the characters are attractive and the feeling is one of realism.In the last few years a number of films have been made about combat on the Eastern Front. For instance Enemy at the Gates and Stalingrad. Both films look like sanitised television shows by comparison. The film is both effective as a work of art and also of a portrait of the reality of a brutal conflict."
seanmcbeth,"Aug 5, 2023",5/10,"This definitely isn't a bad film, but I feel compelled to review based on its inflated rating. There's hardly any substantial dialogue that makes you find the characters interesting. There's also a lot of over dramatization. It's a movie that's hard to watch but not because of the brutality, it's because the scenes are so drawn out and dull. Platoon came out a couple years after this and Full Metal Jacket 6ish years before so there's not a lack of fantastic war movies from this era. This movie just isn't one. I'm convinced that Russia has nothing to offer in the books and film department (last hundred years or so)."
mott59,"Feb 6, 2001",10/10,"Which is no slam against either of those flicks.""Come and See"" is simply in a class by itself in the way it brutally depicts the horrors of war. It is thoroughly uncompromising, and determinedly unique. A harrowing, hallucinatory trip through Hell via WWII.Though it will challenge the squeamish, it is a magnificent film about a grim subject."
johnnyboyz,"Jun 5, 2007",8/10,"Although seemingly a war film, Come and See really presents itself as a drama of sorts centring around one person and their horrific journey through a wartime period. The fact that this protagonist is, indeed, a 'fish out of water' adds to this theory. He doesn't seem to have a particular set mission and once the film gets to its hour and three quarter mark, the only mission aim I could see was: just damn-well survive!Very rarely do we get to see films about the Second World War, set on the Eastern front and made by the Eastern Europeans themselves. When we do, it would seem; we are royally treated. Back in the 1920s, something known as 'Soviet Montage' was the Soviets finding their film form. This is put across most notably in 'Strike!' and 'Battleship Potemkin'. In Come and See, despite being made in the 1980s, there are numerous Soviet Montage references that proves at least to me that director Elem Klimov knows his stuff. A series of disturbing images is put across to us without much in the way of dialogue but also relying heavily on music of the classical variety  this is Soviet montage and this is what happens during the truly memorable moments in Come and See.The film begins on a light-hearted note of two children 'playing' wars on a battlefield that has recently been fought for but this is only the hint at what's to come  one of these children is going to wish it had stayed a game. Then, he his taken from his home and tossed into the Eastern front. This event setting up a fascinating twenty-five or so minute sequence set around a woodland base where he meets other soldiers, gets his picture taken and indulges in some good old fashioned propaganda  he also accidentally yet seemingly randomly steps on a nest full of eggs when out on patrol; I feel this is an indication to the death and the crushing of the innocents to come.The film cleverly moves from one thing to another be it bedded down in a woodland base camp, taking cover in a field during a gun fight between two sides he is, quite literally, stuck in the middle of or perhaps the most famous: stumbling across a small town that the Nazis have targeting for utter eradication. It's no secret that the Germans destroyed villages by killing the inhabitants, destroying the buildings and then burying absolutely everything to cover up evidence and what happens in Come and See is as close to that as I have ever seen in any other film  maybe no other film with a better example even exists.With regards to the Soviet Montage references, when Come and See was made; Russia as we know it now was still the Soviet Union and its depiction of events is not only shocking and disturbing but also loud and forced upon you  such is war to a young man without too much life experience. From the fact an actual skeleton is dressed up to look like Adolf Hitler; just so it can be blown up again, seeing burnt out corpses lying there to music of some kind to the overuse of faces and peoples reactions in close up and, more importantly, montage format is enough evidence to suggest this is not only a modern, mind numbing war film but also a throwback to the old days of Soviet film-making.What also works is the constant use of horrible, horrible sound. The loud, disturbing noise the aeroplane makes when it hovers overhead constantly reminds us and the lead character of the first time it happened when bombs were dropped relatively close by; thus rendering him (and us) temporarily deaf. It is a nasty reminder of the psychological effects of war. The way the town is dealt with through suspense and screams is particularly horrible as is the way the Nazis merely leave alá the Vikings did centuries ago. They came, they burnt, they pillaged and then they left  torches aloft just like the Germans in Come and See.Come and See is not for the feint hearted nor is it for people who aren't heavily into film. At over two hours long, it's difficult to sit through and concentrate on fully all the time but not only this, it presents some of the most disturbing scenes in the eeriest of ways I've ever seen in a war film. Truly memorable film-making."
real_hiflyer,"Nov 22, 2007",10/10,"If anything, this movie is more powerful than Schindler's List and All Quiet on the Western Front. It personalizes the trauma war brings by concentrating on one main character, a boy who plays war with his buddies and then suddenly finds himself thrown into the maelstrom of War playing him. It shows us how war traumatizes us, then hardens and changes us until cruelty becomes our own means of surviving. And germinates those first seeds of anger which reside in all of us.So this film is both timeless and universal. Like the child soldiers in Africa and other countries, like those children who even now are being raised on a diet of hate and propaganda. We are reminded here that war is horror, that the innocent usually always pay more heavily than the guilty, and without unavoidable provocation should always be seen as a last resort.It should also remind us that over 600,000 Iraqis have been killed in a war America instigated, based on lies. It's way past time that those in the administration who caused this abominable tragedy be brought to task for causing the death and suffering of both our young soldiers caught in the crossfire,and the indiscriminate killing of the innocents who live and die there now."
rpduffy861,"Nov 2, 2013",10/10,"I've always been deeply intrigued by the atrocities committed against humanity during war, specifically WWII. I thought I had seen every WWII war movie there is to see. I accidentally stumbled across this gem when I was searching for the best Halloween movies and #100 was Come and See. After reading all the reviews here on IMDb I absolutely had to watch it for myself. I was not prepared for anything this spectacular, it's truly, like many others have already stated, ""A MASTERPIECE!"" I watched it last evening, alone and was crying by the second scene and never really stopped crying. It's exhausting, painful, and an emotional drain but quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen thousands. I would not recommend this be viewed with young children. If you are in high school and you are learning about WWII history you might want to check this one out but be prepared to become mildly depressed. I haven't been able to really think of anything else since watching it last night. I almost feel like I need some sappy, happy-go lucky book or movie to make me feel better. They don't make movies like this one very often, in fact, I can't think of anything in recent history that even comes close."
Polaris_DiB,"Apr 19, 2006",10/10,"Have you ever had that dream where you're trying to run as hard as you can but don't seem to be moving very fast at all? One scene in this movie is that dream recreated amazingly! This is a Russian war movie about WWII, or rather, about a young boy eager to join the ranks in WWII but is immediately sent through about every torment personal and psychological imaginable.A lot of it is very visceral, gut-wrenching fear and agony at the atrocities being shown, but at the same time it has this flowing neatness about it. This movie loves the land that's being destroyed around it, the trees and the birds and the sounds, and with long smooth tracking shots it seems to suck in the idea of beauty everywhere it goes... even if the camera is focusing on the charred remains of a still-living but barely comprehensible human being who was torched by the Nazi army.It's also a very subjective based film, dealing almost entirely through the eyes of the young boy who is perfectly acted by a kid much younger than me! In order to increase the pov feel of this film, much time is spent having the characters or faces looking directly into the camera and talking to the audience, something that is effective in a lot of situations anyway but in this film basically traps the audience Clockwork Orange style into sitting and watching every minute of it.--PolarisDiB"
Screen_O_Genic,"Nov 4, 2021",6/10,"A failed undertaking of epic proportions, ""Come and See"" (Idi i smotri) is a laborious effort to convey the horrors of the Eastern Front during the 2nd World War. Focusing on the tale and travail of an adolescent thrust into the cauldron of the world around him the film conveys in crude, ugly and grimy scenes the filth and misery war thrust on the Russian peasant class. With minimal battle scenes the movie instead portrays in tunnel vision the narrow world view of individuals and their place in a momentous era in world history. The filmmakers fail in almost every way to do justice to what could have been a gripping tale by flopping in pacing, music, cinematography, etc.; the inability to convey what they simply set out to do. The scene where atrocities occur is too flat and erratic to successfully show the nightmare of such and the film's attempt at a flashback is childish and amateurish enough to elicit pity and disbelief. While the acting is good and there are moments where the hell of war howls through they're far too few to make it work in this loooooooooooong and tedious work. Another clunker ballyhooed by the hipster twerps as essential this is two and a half hours of your life you won't get back. You've been warned."
lukedela,"Jul 7, 2006",10/10,"Put simply, 'Come and See' is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is also one of the most effective anti-war statements ever produced and many of its images still resonate today, particularly the dark and bleak ending. It works better as an experience rather than as entertainment and should definitely be watched in a single sitting.Amazingly shot, filmed and acted, it serves as one of the pinnacles of Russian Cinema. That being said, it is not a film for the faint of heart. Althrough the actual atrocities in the film make up only a small part of the film, the scene is unrelentingly brutal and there is a prevailing sense of dread throughout the film.Also, there is much controversy about the ending sequence of the film and many people view the film as anti-German and merely Russian propaganda. Personally, I view the film, at face value, as a warning about the dangers of fascism rather than being anti-German. 'Come and See' is not simply a case of condemning Nazism but rather a wider view that everybody has the capacity to do what Hitler did.'Come and See' cannot fail but provoke a reaction in an audience, which very few films actually do and because of this it is universally worth seeing. It is definitely a film that lingers in the memory."
Mr-Dahman,"May 26, 2020",7/10,"It's really pretty good , it's realistic ,it describes the horror of the war from a civilian view, it's not very propagandist and partisan"
Reebox,"Oct 23, 2006",2/10,"A war movie should educate the viewer in any of a number of ways. We should appreciate courage and sacrifice, we should empathise with the cold, hungry and terrified. We should be told about historical events and their impact on the final outcome.This film sent me to sleep during the first 60 minutes. Time that should have been spent providing some base detail about Floryan's life was spent with long shots of expressionless faces and inconsequential wildlife. I tried hard to see the relevance but it escaped me. As a result I did not bond with the lead characters.The tuneless soundtrack was delivered at such a level that I couldn't make out the most important bits of dialogue. I had to switch on the subtitles to follow the story. I say follow the story but I'm not sure it had one. It was more a jigsaw of loosely connected events. I was unable to reconcile one scene with another. You find yourself asking "" How did he get there"" and "" Where did so and so disappear to"" The DVD blurb mentions the movie having ""realistic battle scenes"". Nonsense - there isn't a single battle scene where you see the Belorussians v the Nazi's in a conventional fight.The blurb also states that "" this is a film that Hollywood would never make"". I agree, it wouldn't make any money.This film contains nothing that hasn't been done before.The only reason I give this two stars is that the film educated me about the Belorussian landscape.Most disappointed !"
macunak20o,"May 24, 2003",10/10,"Being from the country, where the movie story took place, sharing the same cultural background gives probably bias to my comment, but it also touches me deeper. When I was a child Belarus was still in USSR and they used to show many war films on TV. I saw this movie also, but I didn't really like it. There was not much of war for me at that time, lack of skirmish. Ironically, at those times it was not the best movie to show to soviet people. The screen play was written by Ales Adamovich, belarusan writer, who didn't stand a high esteem of soviet government. Some scenes in this movie tell about things which were forbidden by soviet propaganda machine (that actually ukrainians collaborators, not (only) germans burned the people, how partisans were ""heating up"" - acting in in police uniforme, things about belarusan collaboration, about ""samaachova"" etc). The WW2 in USSR was something holy, and only one version of it existed, the government one.So, for movie to exist, and to come to audience, Elem Klimov had to have some ""right propaganda"" things in there. This is there irony is - now, then Belarus is independent, the scene with shooting Hitler's portrait looks ""toooo"" propaganda. and  now this is also not the best war movie in political point of view. But don't take me wrong, Klimov could actually believe in those things, and there is nothing to condemn here.And the movie. Unfortunately, there are many things which hardly can be understood if you are not from Belarus. The way Florya Gaishun speaks, faces, houses. and pain, and fear and degradation, and ambiguity. ambiguity people had on occupied territory, ambiguity of times when movie was made. but the movie is not a propaganda of any kind, if one can go above he and she will see - it is on psychology of civil people during the frightful war. Camera and its dynamism in the movie are just great.A year ago, I saw the movie 2nd time and now on the big screen. After my friend and I went off the cinema, i could not speak, i could just walk. there was nothing to speak about. ___________________to Daniel Karlsson - common, Klimov did NOT want to be Tarkovsky. this is an absolutely different type of movie, different directoring. this is YOU who sees here shadow of the most ""pop on west"" soviet director. this is not the tarkovsky type of art, but it should not be of this type to be a genuine thing."
Jonah-7,"Aug 22, 1999",10/10,"I have never been so affected by a film. At no point in my life have I hated war as much as I did throughout the watching of this film.  Now I understand why Come and See was used to educate East German students as a sort of ""Just Say No"" propaganda film against neo-Fascism.   However, while I watched it not once was there a moment of self-reference in relation to the film or intellectualizing over the mise en scène.  This is owed completely to the effectiveness of Elem Klimov's intentions.  The title, ""Come and See,""  is his direct invitation to the audience to join in the horrors of 1943 Byelorussia. We are not permitted any moment to wander through the scenery.  This is a polar contrast with Tarkovsky, who gives us the gift of time and silent contemplation as if we were reading a spiritual text.  With this film every moment is charged with a negative beat tied to an even more negative beat looming on the horizon. The sequence in the forest with Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) and the girl (Olga Mironova) is an ominous allusion to innocent love, yet through sound and the handling of the camera we are not allowed to relax in the children's fantasy.  It suggests a traditional youth-in-love sequence, but a constant unsteadiness of camera and a cacophony of discomforting sounds mocks the viewer.  We are not allowed to find solace in their relationship, because the viewer possesses a sober omniscience of what is likely to come thus separating us from their delusion. Klimov uses unsteadiness of camera and erratic panning to keep the viewer dreading the coming events.  Even when the subject is not moving through the scene there is a subtle chaotic motion of the camera, contributing to the feeling that the very air that the characters inhabit is thick and unbearable, that to move through nature is to traverse a battlefield."
gbill-74877,"Feb 5, 2020",9/10,"There's a moment in 'Come and See' when director Elem Klimov directly references Tarkovsky's classic 'Ivan's Childhood' - it's when the boy peers down into a well and sees his reflection in the water - and there are probably all sorts of other parallels as well, such as that beautiful scene when he's in the forest shaking the tall trees with the girl to make the water splash down. It really made me want to see the films back to back and compare them in their imagery, camera technique, and what they tell us about the Russian experience during the war. This film is certainly darker (much darker, my god), and a part of me thinks that Klimov was building on the great Tarkovsky's work and saying that this was Ivan's real childhood, a nightmare of apocalyptic proportions.I don't think anyone who watches the film can ever forget the horrifying images of the German army running amok over a Byelorussia village and burning its people alive. That it's accurate - and just one of 628 such atrocities - is truly mind-numbing. But Klimov also gives us indelible visuals earlier in the film, such as the when the boy and girl run down the muddy road in search of his family, and she looks back to see a pile of corpses against the house, or later when they wade through the muck of a bog that comes up to their chests and looks like it might drag them down to their deaths. The scene in the fog on the farm as they scavenge for food and steal a cow is memorable too. The German army is distant for much of the film, bombing from above in the forest scene (for which the audio effects are extraordinary), shooting from afar, and driving troop trucks by in the mist. They're distant, that is, until they're not, and then it's overwhelming.The Soviet Union made some tremendous films about the war ('The Ascent', a film from Klimov's wife, the great Larisa Shepitko, also comes to mind), and this is certainly one of the very best; it has to be on a short list for greatest war movies of all time. There is a patriotic feeling to the film in the stern look the partisan leader gives the Germans and a pride in the perseverance of the Russian people, but mostly this is a sorrowful film about the horror of war coupled with a desire to never let what happened be forgotten. It certainly succeeds in that, because that's what this film is - unforgettable.Quote, from Revelation 6:7-8:
""And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."""
SteelBlue82,"Jul 24, 2020",N/A,I didn't find it to be anti-war. I found it to be pro-soviet. Two things led me to this conclusion. The larger than life emotions from the protagonists and the sadistic ineptitude of the antagonists.The over-the-top emotions and scenic landscapes were very lovely at the beginning.
devosjohn,"Feb 27, 2021",9/10,"The reviews convinced me to see this 36 years old movie in 2021. It blew me away, even today it's still the best war movie ever made. Great cinematography that makes you really feel the horror of war in the most intense and allegorical way, in stead of just showing it. Everything about this movie is state of the art: the darkness, acting, soundtrack, editing, story development, and so on. A movie that crawls under your skin, it's day + 1 i saw it, and i just must write this admiring review, and see it again tonight"
phxmike,"Jan 27, 2021",1/10,"A typical soviet propaganda film of the worse kind. They have created many like this. The only difference that in this movie they simply went further and more brutal. The soviet hordes rapped all europe and kept easter europe occupied for 50 years making even more terrible things. This movie is heavily one sided hence my warning, propaganda and not art!"
paulclaassen,"Jan 19, 2024",9/10,"I've seen many war films but none are as powerful and realistic as 'Come and See'. The film is so exceptionally well made that some of the scenes were difficult to watch. Please note: Jews will find this film very disturbing, so choose your audience wisely if you intend showing this at movie night.This is not an action packed war movie like most of the Hollywood box office films. It is not sensationalized, nor is it propaganda. Instead, this is a deeply emotional journey told predominantly from a young boy's perspective.The young boy in question is Flyora (superbly portrayed by Aleksey Kravchenko who was just 15 when he made his debut in this film). Whilst playing on a beach with another boy, Flyora finds a rifle buried in the sand. At that moment a German plane flies over, noticing Flyora. The next day Russian officers visit Flyora's home to enlist him.Commander Kosach orders Flyora to remain behind at the camp when the forces move on, and he then meets a young nurse called Glasha, who has a crush on Commander Kosach. Shortly afterwards, the camp is bombed by German forces and Flyora and Glasha flee.What follows is a harrowing tale of a young boy losing his grip on reality as the horrors of war unfold around him. I can't stress enough how absolutely perfectly cast Aleksey Kravchenko was as Flyora. He carried the film with ease, and conveyed so much emotion with a simple stare or facial expression. He was bloody fantastic!! (It is such a shame he gave up acting for more than a decade after this film. Thankfully, he returned to acting in 2000.)I have something to confess: during the film's first act there were moments when I thought some scenes were too long, and I found the film noisy with people talking very loud, shouting, screaming and crying. I was being naïve and judgmental. The film indeed took it's time telling us about Flyora and Glasha, but I now understand how necessary this was.The film became increasingly disturbing and some scenes and events shocked me to the core. This is a very emotional film, and one of the most powerful war films I have ever seen. I can't unsee the final thought-provoking moments. This is a one of a kind war movie!"
signe-nowak,"Jun 4, 2012",10/10,"Come and See is probably the best World War 2 movie I have ever seen. It is also the movie that has affected me the most, leaving me with a feeling of unease for days afterwards. And this is not a bad thing, that is exactly how a movie about war should be. What is impressive about this movie is that it is 100% real, everything that happens is real and that is very obvious to the viewer which is why it is so beyond moving. This is a movie that will not leave anyone unaffected seeing that, even though it is fictional, all of what happens in this movie actually happened in history, but in an even bigger scale. This is what is frightening and what creates the feeling of unease. Klemov does not leave anything to the imagination of the viewer but show in a brutal way just what the Nazis did to the villages and the people in Byelorussia at the time which is a clever way to prevent the reader from ever being completely able to think that ""this is just a movie"". Horrible, clever, beautiful, frightening, real, absolutely beyond excellent - I cannot praise this movie enough."
johnandrewberardo,"Dec 14, 2007",10/10,"Not many films can capture the bottom of the jar of realism. Come and See, directed by Elem Klimov is one of the most realistic films that captures the terror of World War II in Russia. Nazi Germany invades Russia slaughtering villagers and massacring Jews. The story centrals on a young boy, Fleor, who witnesses his family's death, escapes dropping bombs, escapes a burning building, and still has his gun in the end.Come and See is a kinetic piece of cinema that will stick with me for the rest of my life. After watching Spielberg's Schindler's List, I didn't think it was possible to be effected as I was. Klimov does a fantastic job in disturbing his audience by showing the true terrors of the war. He assaults the audience with his images of violence. He expresses the ""glee"" of the Nazi's to a perfect T. Yet, behind all the horror, Klimov centrals Come and See on a young boy who doesn't lose his soul in a time when it would be easy to give up. If you want to watch a film that will expose you to the actualities of the Nazi's, then watch this movie. Klimov's Come and See is a film that is in pursuit of something real, and it finds just that, if not more."
joex-94,"Sep 15, 2022",N/A,"This is, by no small margin, the most excrutiating of exercise in pure agony that I've ever been subjected to. And in the end, I'm damn happy I was. Because as brutal and savage as it gets, this movie ultimately accomplishes its objective: to give us, the audience, the most unbiased and unpolished view into war, what it truly is and what it does to the mind and soul of the men and women who experience it.Hats off to all of who participated in the making of this horrible yet beautiful masterpiece. For after this I can truly say that I have stared into the abyss, if only for a short while. I have seen true evil, I have seen the Devil in the details, and it frightened me. And boy, am I glad it did. For if nothing else, I can now say without reservation that I have a soul, and I believe that it will be strengthened by this that I have just witnessed. Even though, at times, it certainly came close to breaking.So ultimately, my critique of this movie is this: A poignant, moving and, ultimately, utterly devastating piece of cinematic history that must be experienced by all who claim to have a soul. For in the wake of this horror, it shall truly be put to the test."
BillGarrett9189,"Feb 11, 2011",10/10,"I am a sucker for good war movies. In other words, I am a sucker for war movies that do not star Nicolas Cage, or sometimes, Mel Gibson. I find this genre fascinating when I feel that the experience of war is accurately depicted with no overzealous glorification. Elem Klimov's Come and See adheres to that particular condition.Come and See feels real because of the hardships the protagonist, Florya, must endure throughout the film. Florya is found trudging his way through swamps and dodging bullets. Unlike an American film, Come and See stays true to reality in that it is very violent towards the adolescent protagonist. This element of the film serves to remind the audience of the reality that war knows no age.There is no glorification here. The movie serves as a reminder to what war really is. In this film, one can come and see that war is merely a undertaking of survival, not a game of planting a flag into the soil and declaring a nation conquered."
Soroush_Jozani,"Dec 13, 2010",7/10,"Ellem Klimov's masterpiece about the German invasion of Russia. This film truly captures the feeling of war. You can even feel the quick mud and cold weather in this film. One thing that is truly amazing about this movie is that although it is an anti war film(and the best, in my opinion), it doesn't whine about war and how the soldiers are treated(unlike ""Born on the fourth of July""); instead, it gives us the true feelings of the people who are under attack by others. I don't recommend this film for people who(like me) lived through these situations since it brings your most horrible memories in front of you. But other than that, it's highly recommended for people who are interested in cinematography and sound design, since it has some new ideas used in it."
robert_zucker,"Apr 5, 2020",1/10,"I was extremely disappointed. I watched this film after seeing the title in a list of ""most realistic"" war movies. I found it to be quite boring. I should have turned it off early, but other reviews led me to think that it would get better as I watched a bit more. It did not."
bmmason-57615,"Aug 28, 2020",10/10,This movie is incredible! The acting and effects are amazing for a movie made in the Soviet Union in 1980's. When people say greatest war movie people often say something like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's list but this is by far the best war movie. This is about as real as a war movie can get because the director went through the nazi occupation of Belarus. Something that is also really good about the movie is the use of natural light so there is always some sort of eerie ness in the movie. This may be the scariest and most realistic war movie of all time.
sayantan_xaverian2004,"Oct 3, 2007",10/10,"The tag line of another great war drama Casualties of war seemed to me as the most appropriate line to describe Elem Klimov's poetic war drama COME AND SEE(Idi i Smotri).Unlike many traditional war films,'Come and See'-has no heroic catharsis or narrative symmetry .Instead Klimov's apocalyptic vision ,which mixes poetic and brutal imagery,focuses on the destruction of a young life and the horrors of war.I am glad that this movie finally made into the top 250 list but i personally wish that a movie of such a calibre should easily make to top 5 ,if not the best. Most war movies deal with the heroic deeds of a single or a group of soldiers ,but what attracted me most about Come and See is the fact that the two main characters of the movie are SOUND and VISION.I never believed before watching this movie that a wonder can be created without the help of any war hero.It remains the best war movie i have watched till date taking into consideration the likes of Appocalypse Now ,Saving Private Ryan,Glory,Platoon,Patton ."
oshapiro24,"Feb 9, 2012",10/10,"If there was a single movie that showed so much emotion, hardships, pain mentally and physically it was ""Come and See"". This movie truly showed the world how eastern Europeans fought and what they endured in order to protect their land from the Nazis. Taking place in Belarus, Florya did not show himself as a heroic soldier who fought for freedom and justice. Rather the 13 year old boy showed the audience what it means to be a boy in war torn Belarus. There was no heroism, no dramatic or artificial killing scenes done by Florya. He simply displayed the psychological and emotional pain that he endured as did the many other villagers. The goal of the movie was not to lavishly portray the Russians and fellow eastern Europeans defeating the Germans but rather show the fight that each soldier had on and off the battlefield. Both of my grandfathers served in the Red Army and fought in Belarus. This movie had one of the biggest impact of my life. I felt proud to be a native Russian because this movie was not propaganda movie. This movie showed the fighting spirit in an average boy. If I were to place myself in the same situation, I suspect I would be no different than Florya. Elem Klimov said : ""I understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay coauthor, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: ""Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace."" One must never forget the tragedy and the great costs that took defending one's land from invaders. This movie calls for peace because in such a situation a young boy loses his innocence, his childhood in a brutalizing way. We must never forget the horrors. ""Come and See"" truly gave the world the true perspective of how people fought and the costs that they had to pay to be free. For me personally, this movie will always be engraved in my heart and mind."
Member,"May 14, 1999",10/10,"A truly profound look at the short period of time during which a young boy is forced to face horrible things in Soviet Union during WW2. A gripping, poetic vision, that has a personal edge to it, unlike most Hollywood war films."
lilihieraxx,"Apr 27, 2025",N/A,"When people say how shocking, brutal and impactful this movie is, they're only talking about the last 40 mins or so.They're *not* talking about the initial tedious 1.5 hours of kids walking around, staring at each other and wading through bogs and forests. It only becomes the ""great anti-war film"" once the Nazis show up and the barn fire happens (an intensely confronting scene, to be fair). I think people just don't want to admit this. But it seems to be the only part people cite when saying how brilliant the movie is. That one scene.I first watched Come and See when I was in a deeply depressed state of mind. Usually I watch disturbing movies when I'm depressed because I want to feel something; awaken my senses. So I put on this movie. What I felt was boredom (again, for the first 1.5 hours). On my first viewing I quit half way through. Almost nothing that happened in the first half made me interested in seeing the rest. Second viewing, I get to the infamous finale sequences. Then the penny dropped as to why people rave about the movie. ""Ohh it's because of this one scene right at the end and not the vast majority of the rest of it.""It's not a *bad* movie at all. There are certainly impressive filmmaking elements and harrowing moments. It's just... not what I expected after hearing all the hype for it. Maybe Russian/Soviet cinema just isn't my thing. Or maybe my depression made it hard to be emotionally impacted.But I don't think I'm dead inside... 'Grave of the Fireflies' made me cry like a baby. 'The Zone of Interest' chilled me to the core and made nauseous. But this one... this one made me go ""woah"" about 4 times in a whole 2+ hours. I could've watched two Deep Space 9 episodes in that time.Watch it if you want, idc. Maybe just skip to the last third. You're not missing much before then."
sablauet,"Mar 2, 2003",10/10,"I just caught this film on tape, where did it come from?  -I had never heard of it before and yet it may very well be the greatest war film i have ever seen.  It starts out more or less like a small art house picture and by the end it is epic.  Surely Steven Spielberg must have studied this one before making Schindler's List for it's portrayal of the systematic, town by town liquidation, of jews, gypsies, woman, children... in bellarusse during WWII, and it is absolutely devastating.  Spielberg's film feels like hollywood hokum by comparison, and i really liked Schindler's List, or rather, i thought it was a great and powerful movie.  but there are so many unforgettable images in this movie, images that will forever haunt me, from the opening scene where young boys pry rifles from dead soldier's cold fingers, to the roving eyeball of a dying cow.  Make no mistake, this is a difficult film to watch, but should be required screening for all."
ShootingStar82,"Mar 15, 2025",7/10,"At times, Come and See can be a very difficult film to watch. Not solely because of its content, showing in graphic detail the brutality of the Nazi invasion and devastation of Belarus, but also because of the way the film switches between hyper-realism and surrealism. There are scenes which go on for longer than is (probably) necessary, and other scenes where the cacophony of noise is almost unbearable. Despite these difficulties, Come and See is an extremely powerful film. The atrocities of the Nazis in Belarus is a story that needs to be told. There are also moments in this film that are captivating, eye-opening and educational, and it's put together in a way that is both imaginative and daring.What I found most heartbreaking about Come and See is in reflecting how little humankind seems to have learnt from the past. Cruel and heartless wars still persist today, and the brutality within these wars is all too readily ignored by those who don't want to see it. This is a film that stirs emotions and tries to shake us out of our slumber, which in my eyes can only be a good thing."
robc-26,"Jun 18, 2012",1/10,"I'm going to really stand out from the crowd on this but I thought it was dreadful. Poor acting, poor direction, desperately slow, lacking content and with a childlike obsession with re-using the same image over and over again. I'm sure the plane in the sky is meant to be symbolic. To me it just showed the director only had the budget to buy one piece of archive footage.I'm a lover of slow paced films so I am by no means a modern impatient film watcher. And I love films, but really films are supposed to be entertaining. Or shocking. Or thought provoking. This is so tedious it feels like the director is calling the viewers bluff.i doubt anyone on here will agree with me for fear of appearing like a philistine that just didn't get the 'deep direction' but hey ho.And one more thing. The sound effect used (repeatedly) like an orchestra warming up and crescendo-ing has been done before, properly, by Kubrick in 2001. Copying it like this doesn't come off as homage - just plagiarism.I became so bored I resorted to fast skipping some parts towards the end which I never do. But it's still almost 2 hours of my like I'll never get back."

Germans killed his cousin near that place. So, he walked into the forest and I followed him. Suddenly my father turned to me, trying to not show me the grave: «Do not go farther. You should not».

And we crawled under the truck They came from home after us, but they did not find us. Mom was lying on me and I heard her teeth clattering... In the morning we returned to our home, after Germans leaved it. We entered home and found our grandma on the bed. She lied, tied to it Naked! Grandma... My grandma...

And I shouted and shouted and can not stop...» Luda Andreeva, 5 years oldThey took 13 children, everyone they managed to find and set us in the head of the convoy because they were afraid of the mines, set by partisans. We walked and they ride after us on tracks. If they need water, they send one of us. Boys were not afraid, but girls cried. I remember it was early spring and we were barefoot Germans walked around the village, entering all homes in turn and they herd all parents, they suspected that thy have children fighting as partisan... And they behead them in the center of the village... They ordered: «Look». They did not find anyone in one house and they caught and hanged their cat. It pouched like little child».

I looked in the window and found that they were heading to our neighbors. Me and one of my brothers run into the mud room and fasten the door by hook. Then we sat on to the chest near our mother. The hook was feeble and German broke it in one moment. He overstep the threshold and shoot at us salvo fire. I had not time even to discern, is he young or old. All of us fell onto the floor and I fell behind the chest... When I came back to consciences, I feel something dropping on me It was dropping and dropping, just like water. I raised my head and found that it was my mother's blood and mom is lying killed. I crawled under the bed and all the floor was covered by blood. And I was wet of blood...

s_gangas,"Mar 13, 2002",10/10,"Theodor Adorno in an instructive essay titled ""Education After Auschwitz"", claims that all education should be geared towards identifying and understanding the social causes that led to the immense catastrophe of WWII. In other words, through critical theory he wishes to negate in a determinate way the Holocaust in order to both avoide a similar event in the future, but also to create the conditions for the emancipation of humanity from barbarism. Elem Klimov's film points to this direction. The Nazis are portrayed as total beasts for the reason that these collective atrocities transcend individual character. Cyclical camera - movement creates appropriate disorienting effects that match the inferno of war, while hand-held camera gives this horrific experience an immediacy that most films lack. Klimov celebrates in a lyrical way the power of nature and innocence in contrast to the Nero-like scortching of the Byelorussian village. The dialectic between terror and visual splendoour in not resolved in favour of the latter. Rather, Klimov uses superb visuals in order to emphasize the political dimension of the film without resorting into a sterile aestheticization of war and violence, a vice that permeates most Hollywood productions. Overtly influenced by Bergman's ""The Shame"", ""Come and See"" keeps the memory of these atrocities alive; that in itself is the most noble political function that great art can offer!"

coldwaterpdh,"Sep 9, 2009",10/10,"The reviews are right, this one is amazing. I was shocked at how well it is done.Effectively portraying the Nazis for what they are and were, ""Come And See"" pits an innocent young boy against an animal movement that destroys his village, his entire family and his life for no real reason. He and his 'compatriots,' mostly farmers and other kids, try to do what they can against the invaders. He witnesses brutality and savagery at the hands of the Nazis in a swirl of confusion and exhaustion that is seemingly endless.Not for the faint of heart, this one, like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" should go down as a World War Two film that must be seen to be believed. It is not funny or fun or light-hearted at all. It does not make a mockery of tragedy, nor does it glorify or simplify the actions of the SS; it paints a vivid portrait of destruction and death that becomes one boy's reality in the midst of what seems like a nightmare. The effect on the viewer is incredible and that makes this an important piece of film-making. It stuck with me for weeks and I will never forget seeing ""Come and See.""The fact that the budget was probably minuscule in comparison to other films of this emotional magnitude says a great deal about the folks involved in the project. Plus the fact that it was made in 1985! Wow. A solid 10 out of 10, kids. See it."
Dubhghaill,"Jan 2, 2004",10/10,"I saw ""Come and See"", only once (on the big screen, in 1987) and it remains one, of very few, dramatic works that have had an immediate, and lasting, impact on my life.  This movie's artistry, emotional power, and integrity, combined to produce a profoudly disturbing affect, on me, at the time of viewing; its lasting legacy, is that it made the onset of  ""shell shock"" seem, not just readily understandable, but almost inevitable, among combatants, in a total war situation.  Even though World War Two may seem historically remote, to some, I would, unreservedly, recommend this film, to anyone who would like a greater insight into, any, post-Soviet society."
farineports,"Aug 14, 2006",10/10,"It is truly the most engrossing film one could see from the start. I will have to see it again and that is one reason for its greatness. It's a long time since I've seen it but I know I must. The feeling I remember from it and I did make sure I remembered the title was one of being in the presence of a work of greatness and a classic that I recommend time and again to all those who are serious about film as an art form. This film can and should take its place in the pantheon and it is a shame that not enough people know about it. Even people who are not fans of ""World Cinema"" will find it moving and engrossing. Please see it and recommend it. It deserves the publicity and the humanity it can engender."
oovag,"Jul 17, 2019",7/10,"It's a pretty good movie. At least it is exact at showing the way of proceeding of the SD Einsatzgruppen. As for their cruelty, it also shows that of the predecessors of the Einsatzgruppen, the cavalry in the USA.
Unfortunately, the movie shows Stalinist Antisemistism too. The film denies the Holocaust. The activities of the Einsatzgruppen are directed against Russians, not against Jews."
mholmez,"Aug 22, 2022",1/10,"Obviously I am in the minority but to even call this a movie should be a crime, to be honest I am not even sure what I watched, the whole thing was a confusing, poorly edited low budget mess and I don't even know where to begin in terms of explaining just what a terrible film this is.Firstly the acting is atrocious, heavily overdone and the dialogue must have been written by a mad man because most of it just came off as completely bizarre, human beings don't talk like this to one another, they don't act like this even under extreme duress, it was just straight up nonsense with very little character development.Secondly the soundtrack and audio was also a complete mess, poor sound effects, poorly edited, constant screeching during the middle of the film so as to depict hearing loss from the main character but comes off as just infuriating for the viewer. The cinematography is not much better, the camera work is poorly done and again it shows the shoestring budget here as well.I get they are trying to shock the viewer with a lot of the scenes but all they did was annoy me to no end, they even shoot a real cow with machine guns purely for shock value because like you know can't shoot real humans so let's just shoot some animals, yeah that will show em what real war is like.Honestly overall, utter garbage, I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
jimi99,"Feb 25, 2003",9/10,"""Come and See"" is unique in style, particularly the use of sound, as in the first half of the film when the boy is shell-shocked and deafened and hears a surreal mixture of the natural world and his own thoughts and memories. It was haunting to say the least, especially as it is counterpointed by an idyllic interlude with the girl in the forest before the Nazis arrive in earnest.What is not unique about the film is its ""How bad were the Nazis?"" portrayal of the casual evil of atrocity and murder.  It is shocking even as it is trite, the horrendous violence that was perpetrated with an almost incomprehensible and unanimous joy.  The whole world seems unable to get enough of the recreation of this time of plague of human evil, even after 60 years, and some things should never be forgotten, the sacrifice and nobility of the martyrs and resisters especially.  ""Come and See"" has plenty of that spirit, of the outnumbered rag-tag Russian fighters, and its nationalist pride is understandable.But it is the nihilistic, crushing aspect of war, no matter who the combatants, that make this and all films about war so meaningful, regardless of the historical setting."
Leahdeelya,"Jul 30, 2012",10/10,"This film was so powerful and so stunning in its realism, writing, cinematography, sound and editing that I get chills simply revisiting the film in my mind to write this review. The shots are as beautiful as they are horrifying. What starts as an innocent curiosity transforms into a humbling sequence of terrifying events that push the boundaries of sanity. Despite its intense depictions of human casualties and psychological warfare, the film does end on a redemptive note, and I highly highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in an original film that depicts the resolve of the human spirit in spite of the atrocities and horrors of war."
incomparablemessi,"May 19, 2017",10/10,"I have watched this film 3 times now. The third time was almost too much for me as i had become very emotionally attached to the lead actor. I have read a tremendous amount about the Holocaust but this film is in a class of it's own. This is the first time i have actually seen the despicable Nazi mobile killing squads in a film. Accuracy of them 100%. It is a ""must watch twice"" film but beware, it is emotionally powerful beyond words.I would give it 20/10 if i could.We need more films about the Nazi mobile killing squads but it will need a true genius to put one together.Thankyou if you have read this. you can contact me at incomparablemessi@gmail.com if you wish."
seinfelduk,"Jul 5, 2005",10/10,"I'm from england, and i had never heard of this film before i came across it on t.v on film four. its a shame quality films pass so many people by in this way yet some of the rubbish that is made is widely available, really it should be the other way round, with the quality films more accessible and the dire ones harder to find....never going to happen though.i have no problem with subtitles, most of my best loved films are not in English, and this one ill come back to time and time again. the transformation of the lead is mesmerising to say the least, going from child to somewhat of a middle aged shell is acted out spot on, if only for his emotional expressions alone. The darkness of the piece is what first grabbed me, the dark dusky lighting of the Russian forest adds to the impending doom and gloom of certain danger at the hands of the Nazis, the darkness is broken for a wonderfully shot dream sequence dreamt by the boy, only adding to the nightmare from which he may never wake nor recover.9.5 / 10"
blank703,"Jan 5, 2025",6/10,I was excited to watch this film as it is very hyped up by other reviews. Unfortunately I was let down by the quality of this film. While it is gritty and well acted it's nothing special. It recounts basically 2-3 days of a young soldiers life and doesn't really provide any insight to the war or it's causes. The sound quality and score were both annoying at times and it should have been edited better. Overall I found this to be a decent film but nothing compared to what other people have hyped it up to be. It's worth a watch if you are a history buff but don't expect a masterpiece or you will end up disappointed.
gennadylevitsky,"Apr 4, 2017",10/10,"I will not write about the movie per se. This is my answer to those reviewers who claim that the movie is unrealistic, Soviet propaganda and so on. I will tell one story I heard from the residents of the small Byelorussian town called Starodub. They told me that during German occupation German police caught a woman who supplied information to the local partisans. She was interrogated but kept silent. Then Germans brought her to the watch-tower at the local fire station so that she could see how they will burn her house. She had three kids. Germans told her that they will throw them into the fire and let her to watch it unless she will give information about the whereabouts of the partisans. And when she refused they tied her elderly son and threw him into the fire. After that the woman jumped down from the tower committing suicide and thus saving lives of the other two kids. It is up to you to believe this story or not but I don't see the reason why the residents of the town (not just one but several) would lie to me. In other words, if you are spoiled by the good life naiveté - you may continue to be one or you may wish to become more educated. Make a choice."
Euromutt,"Feb 2, 2005",8/10,"Overall, I enjoyed (if that is the word) ""Idi i smotri."" The imagery is powerful, the scenery is magnificent, the military hardware is an anorak's dream, the overall plot is gripping and the climactic points in the action are nothing short of terrifying. In depicting the gruesomeness of war, this film pulls no punches whatsoever, and from that it derives a lot of its power. Even if you've seen ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" etc., this film will still shock you. The characters' motivations and thought processes are often somewhat incomprehensible, but given the situations in which they find themselves, this is understandable. However, the film is significantly longer than it needs to be, mostly because a great many scenes drag on well past the point of annoyance. Watching this film on DVD, I was mercifully able to fast forward through segments where nothing would happen for minutes at a time. Another point that niggles is the behavior of the Germans. Their almost casual brutality, even towards the Byelorussian police and militia collaborating with them, is perfectly credible. But there is a point in the film prior to which the Germans' behavior is cold and methodical (""gründlich""). Then, from one moment to the next (at the start of chapter 11 on the DVD), all discipline goes out the window and they start behaving as if they're at Club Med instead of in territory crawling with hostile partisans. This is rather jarring, and detracts somewhat from the film's credibility. All told, though, I thoroughly recommend this film, albeit it primarily to war movie buffs."
habbfan,"Aug 7, 2025",N/A,"This is a once in a lifetime experience because you are not the same afterward.A slow starting carefully crafted film that slowly draws you into its existence. At a certain point you cannot stop but continue on and once there, you are lost to the past you knew.Beauty has no place here. It is not a moment by moment examination of humanity, it a slice of life from human experience.I warn everyone before watching it that you will see who you are by the end of it. Like it or not.A final warning that this film is not for the easily disturbed or weak of spirit. It contains images and ideas that will haunt.A must see film despite this."
dhti,"Dec 22, 2018",7/10,"Amazing movie, really shows the Russian suffering. The depiction of the Germans is sovjet propaganda though. It conflicts with everything known about German culture. The Germans act as sovjets. A shame of an otherwise great movie by a great director."
chicuatepedrocesar,"Dec 29, 2024",6/10,"*""Come and See""* is a harrowing and unforgettable masterpiece that delivers one of the most unflinching portrayals of war ever captured on film. Told through the eyes of a young boy, it plunges viewers into the visceral and horrifying reality of conflict, where innocence is shattered, and humanity is stripped bare. With hauntingly realistic performances, stunning cinematography, and unrelenting intensity, the film eschews romanticized depictions of war, exposing its brutal, dehumanizing core. Every frame is infused with raw emotion, forcing the audience to confront the devastating impact of violence on individuals and communities. Profoundly disturbing yet deeply necessary, it's a powerful cinematic experience that leaves an indelible mark on the soul, challenging viewers to reflect on the fragility of peace and the depths of human suffering."
heymansruben,"Mar 28, 2024",4/10,"The movie is so damn weird, the acting is bad, they keep staring in camera. The gore and gruesome things in the movie are not that bad or at least nothing you haven't seen. After being in my watch list for years I finally decided to watch it but man it sucked. The social effects are really bad but that's fine it's not a big Hollywood movie. It does show the some of the WWII horrors but in such a weird and bad way. The most terrifying footage is real life footage near the and they could not even do it themselves. Weird weird movie I just can't recommend it. It's also a very long movie they could have let out a big part of the (very weird) start of the movie."
SpelingError,"Jun 13, 2015",10/10,"Come and See is clearly the most powerful and violent anti-war film ever made.After a boy finds an old rifle, he decides to enter WW2. However, he finds that it is much more horrifying than he imagined and he experiences the horrors of it.What really makes this film so violent is that a mostly young cast is experiencing and acting in this. This movie has some of the most powerful massacre sequences ever put on screen. Rape is often described as forcing someone to have sex in cinema. But this movie doesn't need to be graphic in order to be powerful. In this movie, it is seen as hate-fueled violence being committed against other people. Unlike other movies, you cannot imagine the women in Come and See ever healing from their scars.This movie's ending is up for interpretation. It can be interpreted many ways. Viewed certain ways, it can be seen as one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema history. It's great how it's open up for interpretation but I honestly wish that it made it more clear what its ending meant. Its ending was too thin. Movies don't need to make everything 100% clear but they should at least give clues so it doesn't leave the audience scratching their heads.Going off topic for a bit, whoever thinks that this movie contains propaganda are clearly prejudiced against this movie simply because it was produced in the Soviet Union. Those people are the same ones who wouldn't raise a single finger if this was produced in their country. If you still think that this film is propaganda then you need to watch it with a far more critical eye. Propaganda films should make war look like fun. They should make people want to join the war. They should glorify the acts of killing and ridicule of the enemy. Kubrick even made a parody of this in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. There was probably much more propaganda in 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan then there was in this entire movie which is nearly 2 ½ hours long. Come and See makes your stomach turn every second. It makes you feel disgusted just at the thought of war. It is by far the most effective anti-war film ever made.So in conclusion, this movie is the most effective anti-war film of all time. Its ending is a bit too thin for my taste but everything else in the movie is masterly done. It displays some of the most powerful massacre scenes in cinema and it handles violence expertly."
mikeyjwill,"Jul 28, 2020",10/10,"I have seen quite a few war films. However, this is the best portrayal of real war and it's horrible consequences. The film does an amazing job-for example the main character look at his face expressions in the first 1/4 of the film compared to the last 3/4th of the film. What an amazing job of displaying the horrors of war and way ahead of its time. 1985 release."
alexandremedeirosfilho,"Jul 3, 2020",10/10,"In «Hacksaw Ridge», Doss was a war hero. In «Schindler's List». Schindler was one hell of a hero. But the message this movie spreads is that in a war there are no heroes. There are only two things: casualties and disturbed survivors."
pang99,"Feb 18, 2001",10/10,"Idi i smotri, or Come and See, is the movie that has left the strongest impact on me on the awfullness and sickness of the nature of war and what it does to humans. The scenes are so powerfully made and the acting so real that you feel this must be the true hell of war. No other movie on the subject has struck me so hard as this one. I really hope it will be available on DVD all region, so more people can see this truly masterpiece."
seinfelduk,"Jul 31, 2004",10/10,"the user who said that the boy involved underwent a massive change thro the film was right.I showed this film to a couple of mates who have just started to watch subtitled films, but they have to be good to grab and sustain their attention. This did. The emotions that the lead lad shows is wot makes this film great, when the lad sees the old man burned and the man turns to him and speaks the lad breaks down, is one of the films highlights. this is a really dark film portraying a dark time....5/5"
patricnovac,"Dec 15, 2021",10/10,"This movie is the last war movie one should watch. Because it is the best. There are a lot of great war movies but none of them is close to this one. This movie is the realest war experience someone who's never been in a war can have (hopefully). One of the most intense movies of all time , so grim and hopeless. Do not watch during winter."
jd_joslin,"Feb 27, 2006",N/A,"This excellent film has a haunting and surreal quality that is difficult to describe. The setting is 1943 in Belorussia behind the Russian-German lines. The Germans are carrying out their policy of annihilating the Slavic races. The Nazis seem to have their evil eyes everywhere symbolized by a forked-tailed reconnaissance plane that flies periodically over the landscape.As the movie progresses death appears inescapable as the protagonist, a young Beylorussian boy who joins the partisans, returns home after being left behind on a partisan raid. He and Glasha, a young woman he's with, discover that his village's population has been slaughtered. His twin younger sisters who were introduced earlier are especially cute and delightful kids. Their deaths and that of his mother, who had berated him for taking a risk in joining the Partisans, is made to look Kafkan in its incomprehensible and inescapable evil.The climax of the film is the sickening scene of the Nazis SD troops torching a farm house after forcing all of another village's inhabitants inside. The scene ends with yodeling music as the troops continue a pillaging rampage with flamethrowers. One shot which sears ones mind is a close up of one Nazis infantryman rapidly shaking his head back and forth jiggling his cheeks as if he has just taken a shot of whiskey. While enjoying the intense high of the slaughter he smiles at the camera. This is the all too human serial murderer's psycho-sexual high captured in a nutshell on film.However, for some reason another scene sticks out most in my mind. This is the scene shot from behind of a German motorcycle with attached sidecar in a dawn fog putting along a dirt road leading into the soon to be torched village. The motorcycle is carrying a dead villager with a sign that says ""I insulted a German soldier"". Klimov does a great job at building a feeling of impending doom. You just know that when the fog lifts that day there is going to be hell to pay. I wonder how many of those German motorcycles with sidecars and accompanying machine guns traveled down dirt roads in Russia and the rest of occupied Europe in WW II (many thousands no doubt). They must have often brought just this since of impending doom captured in the film.The partisans ambush the Nazi SD troops in a wood after they leave the village. Somehow this act appears sordid and mundane as does the village slaughter and it does not give a vindication as would a Robert Mitchum or John Wayne movie. Klimov has certainly brilliantly captured the horror and brutality of war in ""Come and See""."
drystyx,"May 8, 2025",6/10,"Come and See is an avant garde style war film set in the WW2 Western Russia area that was full of horror from Nazi atrocities.On the surface, the movie appears to get much of the grit correct, so that makes it more important to get the reality correct as well. It's the same with other ""grit"" movies that try to deliver realistic settings and atmosphere, but fail to deliver, making them ""style over substance"" movies.This one is totally ""style over substance"". The atrocities are realistic enough, as is the chaos. The ""contrived"" matters make it less than meets the eye.The events are seen through the eyes of a boy who loses a lot in becoming a partisan against the invading Nazis. His attitude and his emotions are totally believable. That much is well done.However, the writer director team only pretends to be anti Nazi, when in fact we get too much worship of Hitler's number one ideology of the blond pale woman being immortal. There are many women in this moive, but the only woman who is an evil Nazi serving their propaganda machine is also the only woman in the movie who is not an Aryan blond woman.This cannot possibly be an accident. Instead, it is on purpose a celebration and praise of the most unnatural and foremost number one ideology of Hitler and the Nazis, that women were the fair sex, totally pale and blond and Aryan. This was their number one goal, and it is what they preached above all else.Which makes this movie actually a Nazi propaganda movie. Germany lost their war, but Hitler won his war, thanks to directors and writers who preach Hitler's sermons even today.It's too bad. This could have been a better movie, but instead it preaches too much for what it proposes to be against."
henry's_cat,"Feb 4, 2001",9/10,"This is one of the first films that truly shocked and scared me, as it is really terrifying in its plain brutality and stark portrayal of the second world war from a very human perspective. The shell shock scenes are some of the most poignant that I can remember seeing.An excellent but harrowing film, highly recommended."
dudumnz,"Jul 4, 2022",6/10,"It's hard to describe such aggressive content, it really makes you sick with a clear purpose of delivering a message or a lesson, the worst is that it's not fictional.It's made for people who like the genre war, have patriotic feelings or admire any army aesthetics."
martinandmartin-80414,"Sep 17, 2022",1/10,"I could NOT care LESS about the Protagonist, outside of being a little boy I dont see why I should care about him.This looks worse than a student film and by student I mean High School student. It is pretty much a kid in the middle of a psychosis ans really the entire story is trash. Just slowly disintegrating without really any other goal than shocking you. If they had made a proper film about the war and only later had this kid break down mentally it would have been much more logical, easier to follow and much more impactful.This reminds me a lot of modern day mary sue movies only this is the opposite, the kid is immediately useless and weak and constantly loses and runs.There is no build up, so there is no pay off.Not worth my time and I watched it completely just to write this."
Brittan09,"Jun 7, 2010",10/10,"This film is one of my favorite films I have ever seen because it has left a lasting impression on me. While I don't particularly enjoy war movies, finding the violence often to intense to find anything worth fill in watching it, this movie was different because it was not centered around the actual physical brutality of war, but the mental impact it has on the soldiers. In most war movies I have seen the typical soldier is portrayed as a desensitized character who does not seem to be effected by the murdering and the cruelty of war, which is very unrealistic and a unhealthy message to send to society. What is particularity nice to see in this film are the steps the Flior goes threw to become dehumanized, which is more true to reality in my opinion. Kilmov does an excellent job at making the viewer not only see but also experience the realities of war and the anguish it leaves our soldiers in. In many scenes of the film the viewer experiences the events with Flior through their own senses. For example, when Flior crawls threw the mud pond I felt like I was there with him smelling the mud and it made me actually cringe. Also, the scene when the cow is shot and we watch it die I felt a sense of loneliness and it pained me to watch it. However, this could have been attributed to the fact that I am not accustomed to watching the actual murder of animals, as their deaths are usually faked. At first I thought this movie was an anti-war film, however, the more I reflect I believe that in this case the movie tells us that the war was completely necessary and sought to reveal the courage the people of the Soviet army revealed under such grotesque circumstances."
la_montespan,"Apr 25, 2008",10/10,"I won't go into too much detail because other users have gone into much more technical detail but it's important to reiterate the complete brilliance if this film.I probably watch this movie about every two or three weeks and every it has the same effect every time, read total amazement, heart palpitations, panic attacks, vomiting, paranoia, psychotic episodes etc. etc. (figuratively speaking).I think I have thought about this film everyday since I first saw it about 6 months ago, of Florya's face in the forest, Glasha green dress, the twin girls, the church, the Hitler trap, the swamp, the flying bullets. And the music is equatable to taking shelter from an earthquake in an amplifier.This film will change your life. There can't possibly be a better compliment than that."
bernardz-70-165011,"Jun 26, 2022",10/10,"Despite what people tell you, this is not an anti-war film.It needs to be seen to the end. If you want your kids to see it, then you need adult supervision.One point I will say on the new *improved* version, some of the sound is off but much better then the orginal. The photography is much better. Some of the surreal moments have been cut out and I doubt that improves the movie. Also the word Jew is translated into English as Yid."
goatrope67,"Oct 18, 2022",10/10,"I watched this amazing film last night and it has stuck with me through the evening and still pops into my mind this morning. It was made in 1985 and recently had a 4K update done to it so it looks beautiful. It is a subtitled movie, so if you are not one for that, then avoid this one as it's 2 1/2 hours long.It is about a boy who finds a rifle and wants to join partisan fighters in Russia in 1943. He starts the movie as an innocent boy with a huge grin, willing to do anything to be part of the fight. By the end of the movie he has seen so much that he looks like an old man. It is stark. Violent. Raw. Beautiful. Horrifying. I cannot even begin to describe it other than saying I believe it to be one of the best war films I've seen in a very long time. Throughout the movie the director focuses on faces, showing us how the war eats people alive from the inside out. At first I was caught off-guard by that, then I saw it for what it was and now can't get it out of my head.Hopefully you read this before watching because you need to know there is a TRIGGER warning for my veteran friends out there. The filmmakers used live rounds during the making of the movie, which makes some of the scenes truly hard to watch. But, it lends to the overall feel and appeal of the movie. So, watch with caution."
markmuhpin,"Nov 7, 2019",10/10,"Yes, the real war not just a Hollywood fantasy , for me one of the best because realistic film about war , I don't remember a movie like this where you can see, feal and yes even smell the fear , I know what I talking about I now what the real War is ."
moritzherz,"Apr 9, 2023",6/10,"I did not know the russians could do such great movies. Dersu Uzala, a cooperation with the legend Akira Kurosawa was great and now Come and see delivers again!This is a great anti war movie, maybe the best anti-second world war movie.It's usage of sound and the incredible visuals is masterclass. The beginning of the film was superb. The ending is as shocking as brilliant. Overall this is anti-war as it should be. It may be out of a russian persoective but it is definitely not a propaganda movie so do not fear that!In summary you have to watch this! It's dark, brutal and serves as a warning!"
Jakeyolive,"Jan 28, 2021",10/10,"I wish this film had more acclaim. It's right up there with many Great War films. The most truthful, raw portrayal of WWII to date. Relentlessly miserable. Watch with caution. You are watching real events through the childhood eyes of Ales Adamovich. The scariest film of all time; and it isn't a slasher film, nor a ghost story. A shock to the senses. Masterful cinematography. A journey into the depths of hell. ""Come and See"" is spellbinding, essential viewing for any cinephile."
mendyzucker,"May 21, 2022",9/10,"When it comes to graphic intense World War II movies, it's hard to find meaningful words to describe how powerful or how shocking the scenes that play across the screen can be on the eyes and soul.Come and See realistically depicts one of the worst moments in human history and tragically shows how far humans can remove themselves from humanity and embrace the depravities of war.This film is truly heartbreaking."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 10, 2024",9/10,"Florya finds a gun, and joins of resistance fighters, to help his fellow Belarusians take on The Nazis.Wow, this film did not hold back, I've seen very few Soviet made films, but those I have seen, including a terrific version of Agatha Christie's And then there were none have surprised me.The bleakest of the bleak, this is a war film that certainly aimed to show the dark side of war, and boy does this film do that, some of the scenes had me forced to look away, it's brutal, harrowing, those who are easily upset, take the warning.I have a feeling this will live with me for some time, it really did have a big affect on me. I wouldn't want to sit though it again any time soon, but I'm grateful to my friend for the loan of the dvd.It has a staggeringly good appearance, the sets, costumes, bikes etc all look terrific.Not exactly a bundle of laughs, but it was never meant to be, as a war film, this is bang on the money.9/10."
inigovik,"Jun 16, 2009",N/A,"Emir Klimov depicts through the most raw events, the reality that the Belarus, USSR's population suffered at the hands of the Nazi movement in 1943, and how humanity harms to itself to a maximum level. Florya is a teenager whose excitement and nationalism moves him to defend what is ""his'"" along with the soviet partisans, he later realizes that there is nothing more bizarre in life than losing your family, seeing someone else's life fading away into the arms of war. After he has no one, Florya finds a truly purpose to join the military and fight with a cause. With such an striking control of the stead cam, Klimov makes us experience the war in a closer level to reality, his manipulation of sound, time and space makes us see beyond what the characters feel, and even if there isn't violence on the scene, a gesture, a movement, or a smile takes your breath away."
jondavidfalcon,"Apr 23, 2023",1/10,"I have been looking forward to being able to sit down and watch this movie for a couple weeks. Everything I read online made it seen like I was about to watch the best war movie ever. All the reviews saying how hard it is to watch, well yeah it is hard to watch bc it is terrible. I was expecting a low budget film, thats not a problem for me. But I wasn't expecting it to be shot, edited, and acted high school film student project. The plot makes no sense, the acting is so overdone. I still have 30 minutes left and it is taking all my strength not to get up. There are certain movies that are considered ""masterpieces"" that I might not like, but I still recognize why it is so acclaimed or why people love it. This one, I genuinely have no idea what is considered so great about it."
davidpedersen,"May 19, 2002",9/10,"This is a real war film.  It is not pretty.  It is not a movie such as I've ever seen and I cannot say that I enjoyed it, but non the less it is a film that should be watched for anyone interested in what man is capable of. It should be seen so as to know why we must control ourselves to be as morally aware as possible and to try to get along with each other so as not to repeat the same patterns of history again and again.  The film is very interesting in the way it was made, it is so unconventional that it is hard to relate to it.  It actually gave me the feeling that I was a witness to an event that was absolutely intolerable and despicable.  Watching this film was like being there yet your mind cannot take the pain and torture so it becomes a dreamy nightmare that one cannot escape from until wakened by the live reversing footage of Hitler's Europe imploding at the end of the film. Quite a work of art.  This film should not be seen by the faint or those that try to escape trying to understand human depravity at its best."
sxstyle,"Dec 12, 2007",10/10,"It is a disservice to call what the actors in this movie do ""acting""; they are LIVING the movie, and because of this it feels as if you are really watching what the Eastern front must have been like in 1943. The main character, in particular, actually ages VISIBLY over the course of the film, his youthfull face aging into a reflection of all the horrors he has seen.The film is full of memorable moments, and will definitely hold your interest. Upon final scene of the movie one starts to understand that there are no heroes or winners at war, there are people who forget that they are people and live according to the animal instincts."
freemantle_uk,"Apr 21, 2009",10/10,"Come and See is a bleak and violence look of the Second World War in the small nation of Belarussia in the USSR. It is a powerful, tough but rewarding watch.The film focuses on Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko), a teenage boy, I guess around 16, who finds a Soviet rifle buried in his village. He is quickly recruited into the Soviet Partisans to join the fight against the Nazis. As the troops are about to leave their base in the forest Florya's commander decides to leave the young man behind. Florya befriends a young, but mad girl, Glasha (Olga Mironova) who was fancied by all the men in the base. Both head back to Florya's village but find that the whole population, including his family had been murdered by the Germans. Florya withdraws and joins a small platoon, leaving Glasha behind. After the platoon is killed Florya ends up in another village just in time for to the Nazis exterminate the population.Come and See is a war film, but not in the traditional way. You don't see any set piece battles. The director, Elem Klimov, treats the film as an art house film, focusing on Florya's character, lost of innocent, and physical ageing. Many shots focuses on character faces and is shot in a grim style, a symbol of the war. The main theme of is the destruction and madness of war. It show how horrible the war on the Eastern front was, with massive civilian casualties. In historical terms the Germans scored a big own goal because the Soviet population hated Stalin and his regime. Their treated the Germans are liberators, but the Germans never used this public support and ended up killing a large proportion of the population. The character of Glasha to me represents the madness, but surprising incitement, of war. Compared to Florya who was innocent and looses it during the film. Their is also a religious subtext to the film. The title Come and See is a reference of 'The Apocalypse of John'. During the film the Horsemen of the Apocalypse are referenced. The title could also mean seeing the apocalypse that the Nazis were causing. Finally whilst watching the film it sort of reminded me of the Medieval period, with the Partisan forces living in a forest in wooden shacks, the villages being medieval in style, with technology and the wooden houses, to the athorities the Nazis forced on the locals.It is a powerful film about the madness of war. A must see."
litvania,"Oct 7, 1999",10/10,"This award-winning movie may become a real eye-opener for overseas audience. Apart from ""Saving Private Ryan"" American cinematography for the most part ignored the other side of WWII.""Idi i smotri"" shows the German occupation in Belarus through the eyes of a teenager. His village gets burned, his relatives get massacred, he becomes the witness of many other atrocities, joins underground partisan group.The movie is very similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that it shows the grim, the real face of the war. Yet it is quite different from Spielberg's masterpiece for it does not really show the happy ending, the way out, but rather leaves the reader to ponder over these tragic days."

gluegat08,"Dec 12, 2010",N/A,"This movie was very sad to me. It really brought out the true colors of the Nazis during WWII. I felt that most war re-enactments are too scared too show the gruesomeness that this movie showed with ease. The main character shows a true character arc. He is timid in the beginning. He is naive and scared, but after witnessing with his own eyes the destruction and death that has been brought over his people. He becomes obsessed with the fact that he feels revenge is the only way to get even against the Germans.Not to mention he looks like he aged about 30 -40 years through out the movie. Over all this movie is not for the faint of heart but if a person is looking for a movie that clearly depicts the horrors of WWII, this is the movie for them."
forzosky,"Dec 6, 2024",6/10,"I'm sorry but just not as good as people made it out to be. I feel like this is a common 70s movie trope where certain plot devices become so abstracted that it becomes difficult to understand parts of the movie. Yes I know what symbolism is and all that, if I wanted a whole movie about symbolism I would read a poem. I don't know what else to say other than that I really just didn't enjoy this film. I wanted to really badly but it just didn't happen for me. If you are a ""movie person"", you probably will like this but if you are just a regular enjoyer of movies than I don't know if you would enjoy it."
eschranck,"Dec 15, 2011",9/10,"I've seen my fair share of films about the first and second World Wars, but none quite like ""Come and See."" This film tells the story of a boy of fourteen years, Florya , who joins the Russian army in their efforts to defeat the Nazis. His excitement at going to war in the beginning of the film is enough to make you want to get out of your chair, somehow penetrate the screen, and slap him into realizing what he's about to have to witness—and worse—do.Florya's excitement, however, doesn't last long. Over the remaining two hours, we (the viewers) watch as the hands of war reach inside his very core to steal what's left of his innocent soul. With every image of Florya's perpetually aging face, we are reminded that he is just one of thousands of young boys who faced the same fate—fighting to survive.Klimov's film only depicts the fate of one Byelorussian town—there were six hundred in total! Truthfully, after watching the film, I was speechless. I didn't want to talk to anyone and I didn't want to think. I wanted to go home, crawl into my bed and hope that the ruthless brutality that had played out in the film wouldn't terrorize me in my dreams.Intense, I know.This film is a must-see. Although very difficult to watch at times, it's important that we expose ourselves to that which makes us uncomfortable; to that which we sometimes just want to forget."
JayWolfgramm,"Oct 10, 2025",7/10,"The movie revels in making its audience uncomfortable. There is very little background music. There is an abundance of long shots where the actors stare right at the camera, or switch to a straight POV shot. It is a war movie with no battle plan and no big picture. We are just given the keyhole view of a young soldier, who learns firsthand that war is the worst. Both sides are full of perverse immature deviants doing monstrous things. The main character is often lost in the shuffle of things. Everyone and everything is filthy in many ways. Given the description, you can understand the movie's strengths and weaknesses. It is not a ""feel good movie"", it is a ""war is the worst thing ever movie"". You can figure if that sounds like the type of film for you and see for yourself."

There is no other way to put it.Not sure why this has such high ratings but they probably didn't watch the movie or are paid trolls.The movie is boring, no, it is extremely boring. The acting is the worst. There is animal torture.There is no reason to watch this movie since there are many good war movies out there.Some claim this is some arty movie or whatever but you shouldn't believe that. Unless you don't mind wasting 2 hours of your life for one awful experience.Did I mentioned that the movie is extremely boring? It is slow and agonizing boring. As as war movies is concern, this one is awful."

XxEthanHuntxX,"Jun 10, 2020",8/10,"A deep, dreadfully macabre and hyper-realistic terror in film were you beg it not to be true, but you are never allowed to comfort yourself that it would not be real, It is the events, which are profoundly shocking and, based on well-documented history. The movie is portrayed from the perspective of a young boy, emotionally ravaged and terrorized. He gets to see and experience more than any human being should, even less a child. The stunning and powerful events are depicted in a hyper-realistic way through bomb-stunned ears in a fantastic and terrible sound world, where iodine boys and Mozart penetrate screams and detonations in a literally indescribable way.It is filmed at the same time chaotic and perfect, with a mesmerizing and horrifying dreamy feeling, which here almost invariably takes the form of a nightmare. The movie faces the overbearing horror of war, without hesitation and in a very realistic way, like no other war-movie I've seen, with both being artistically infernal, politically important, visual setting and psychological devastating.
In addition, this maran does not settle for less than, in a strange sequence at the end, also to plant a few other thoughts of one than hate and delayed revenge."
lyash-71861,"Jan 19, 2022",9/10,"The film ""Come and See"" I first watched in the same 1985 at the cinema. I left the theater with a headache. I was not then mentally prepared for what I would see on the screen.The film is so realistic that it is true, as the author of one of the reviews wrote, you can even literally feel the smell of fire and corpses. When the Nazis dragged the old woman out of bed and left her there to watch the conflagration and die a long death, I almost vomited there, in the cinema hall.This is later. When I watched the film on TV, I already reacted to the film more calmly.The director of the film very talentedly showed the horror of that war. I had the impression that the shooting was carried out live.I have never reacted so much to a war movie as I did when watching this movie.Here, this whole horror is emphasized by both music and sound effects.Well, I'm generally silent about the actors. The actor who played the boy Fleur performed his task simply brilliantly.I advise everyone to watch this movie. Maybe then at least some people will understand what fascism is. And then I often hear statements lately that the Nazis were safe ..."
lalyaob3,"Feb 10, 2012",9/10,"""""Come and See"" is an astonishingly unforgettable, nightmarish vision into the reality of war. We the audience, watch as a young boy, a civilian, transition into a soldier. This change, makes this 12-13 year old boyage about 40 years in a matter of a few days. To endure such horror and atrocity, would definitely create such a drastic distortion to anyone. To have a film, that has the ability to even convey such profound and surreal emotionmaking us, the audience, able to feel, hear, smell and perhaps taste.. is quite daunting. One must realize, that the story line perishes, and we literally feel as if we are trapped in a nightmare, in which there is no escape. Klimov's micro cosmic approach to this specific war, was quite intense; to even think he only showed one village, out of the 628 that were brutally executedto put simplyis incredibly agonizing. I recommend this movie to all, because it will truly leave an imprint on your views towards war, and violence or humanity overall."
ubercommando,"Dec 23, 2003",8/10,"This is probably the most harrowing war movie ever made...I can't think of any other war film that hits you over the head and stomps on your guts as much.  It is a very Russian movie, I can't think of another part of the world where a movie like this would be made in that style.For me, some scenes stand out because I have never seen anything like them. The boy in the woods concussed from the explosions as the German paratroopers arrive.  The soundtrack goes to a high pitched ringing.  The two children running through a deserted village, they stop at a house to eat a cake left in the kitchen.  All around are flies, but where do they come from?  They run out of the house and out of the village; in the background, you see why there are so many flies; the bodies of the villagers are just piled high against a building, but the children don't notice them.  The Germans herding the villagers into a barn and burning it.  Later, the Nazis are herded themselves by Russians and douse themselves with petrol as they go mad.  The effigy of Hitler made out of mud and grass.Apparently, this movie was originally planned to have been directed by Klimov's wife; the brilliant Larissa Shepitko (who directed ""The Ascent"") who died in a car crash before the project got going.  ""The Ascent"" deals with a lot of similar themes and shares the same premise of partisans struggling to survive under Nazi invasion, but goes into the human side a lot more."
nht125,"Nov 14, 2021",6/10,"Realoistic movie of war. Has shown the cruelty of war . Everything is okay. But killing real animal for the sake of film what i did not like.The film's plot focuses on the Nazi German occupation of Belarus, and the events as witnessed by a young Belarusian partisan teenager named Flyora, who-against his mother's wishes-joins the Belarusian resistance movement, and thereafter depicts the Nazi atrocities and human suffering inflicted upon the Eastern European villages' populace. The film mixes hyper-realism with an underlying surrealism, and philosophical existentialism with poetical, psychological, political and apocalyptic themes."
Niklyor,"Oct 4, 2025",7/10,"76/100Come and See is more than a war film - it's a descent into the darkest corners of human cruelty. Through the eyes of a young boy, the audience witnesses not just the physical destruction of villages, but the psychological collapse of innocence itself. The plot unfolds with haunting realism, showing the dehumanization of war without filters or comfort. Every frame feels alive and painful, as if the viewer is trapped inside the nightmare with the protagonist.Aleksei Kravchenko delivers one of the most haunting child performances ever captured on film. His transformation from a hopeful boy to a hollow-eyed survivor is almost unbearable to watch. Elem Klimov's direction intensifies that horror through relentless close-ups, handheld chaos, and long, immersive takes that turn the film into a fever dream. The sound design - mixing silence, distorted noise, and distant echoes of death - drags you deeper into the mental disintegration of the story.Unique detail: the movie was filmed using real ammunition and explosions to evoke genuine fear from the actors, adding a level of authenticity few war films have ever achieved."
li0904426,"Aug 12, 2022",3/10,"As one of the reviewers noted and I couldn't agree more, director Elem Klimov tried to emulate Andrei Tarkovsky, but failed miserably. This movie is far from being a masterpiece, or even a great movie. Klimov uses exaggerated allegories and metaphors that disarrange the dialogues and images. There are many scenes like that and they are clearly noticeable in the first segment of the movie, it seems the director introduced some of these scenes just to increase the length of the movie. Then Klimov shifts gears and presents us with the realism of the shock by showing us the atrocities of the Second World war. In this ""mixed salad"", what is left is little of art and more of the repulsive, sickening gut feeling to the rawness of the images of war.Perhaps I've watched a different movie than most reviewers, but a masterpiece, unfortunately, this movie far...far from being one."
paddy-2,"Jan 25, 2000",10/10,"Quite simply - one of the greatest films ever made. Not for the faint hearted, and paced to try the patience of those accustomed to fast edited pap, this movie has stayed with me since the day I first saw it. Every few years I gather the courage to watch it again, and it never fails. I doubt if Hollywood - or any other film-making centre - will ever be able to equal Come and See in terms of intelligence, strange beauty, and sheer emotional power."
briancham1994,"Jul 31, 2021",10/10,"I haven't been this affected by a film since Schindler's List. It displays the pure brutality of war in a naturalistic, lingering way that does not allow the viewer to ever take a break. The imagery and cinematography are evocative and disturbing. The main character shows us what war is like through the eyes of a child, and the horrific expression at the end matches how haunted the audience feels as well. This film is incredibly depressing with no hope or redemption at all. The sense of realism is terrifying, and all the better for it."
ntjhforesthill,"Jan 8, 2023",10/10,"One of the most challenging and intense viewing experiences ever, but immediately becomes one of my most important movies.The film combines a brutal naturalistic representation of Nazi war crimes in Belarus with nightmarish surrealism to form a truly unforgettable and nearly unbearable account of war's impact on humans.The acting, especially the lead, is incredible. The 'effects'--all done in camera--are powerful. And the audio soundtrack is amazing, really reinforcing the hellish disorientation of conflict and barbarism.Watch it. Let it sit with you. Choose how you respond to its horror.Some say this is just a propaganda film, but the movie accurately reflects historical atrocities carried out by Nazis and collaborators like the Koriukivka massacre, the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre, the Khatyn massacre, and the Dzyatlava massacre. Burning innocent civilians to death was a common tactic employed by the SS, Wehrmacht, and collaborators."
SameirAli,"Dec 30, 2016",10/10,"Hitler and Nazism have been widely used in films in various languages. Still it is a hot subject.The movie begins with some kids digging for gun. One of the boys want to join the Communists, who are fighting against Hitler invading Russia. The boy meets a very beautiful, mysterious girl at their camp. Soon, the camp was attacked and most of them were dead. The boy and the girl then try to go back to his home. But, nothing good was waiting for him. The village was washes out by the Nazis. The misfortune and tragedy follows him wherever he goes.This is a very depressing movie. The disturbing sound design helps with this. The impact will remain in you for a long time.A must watch masterpiece. Do not miss.#KiduMovie"
bryce_little_jensen,"Jun 5, 2012",N/A,"I must say I jumped quite a bit through this film, though I am not easily startled. Being a combat veteran, this film brought the realist intensity of war that I have ever seen. The point of view camera angles made me feel as if I were truly there. I caught myself trying to make my own schemes of operating in those conditions. It was a n incredible feeling to be so involved throughout this entire viewing. Though the most important aspect of the film to me, was not the film itself but how it affected those watching it around me. They were experiencing war for the first time. And for the first time it was not a story of heroism, nor glory, but instead survival. War is a hell of a thing based around decisions, that you make and decisions that you will live with. I think it is important that people understand it is not a game. And that this is what really happens. I appreciate the awareness of war that this movie created for the people I was viewing it with because I think it is so easy not think about it when its not around you. But it is taking place everyday. By the end, everyone was startled and feeling uneasy. I laughed. That was only two hours. That wasn't real. I get to go home now. These people only got a taste. That left me with a good feeling."
tacohemingway,"Jan 19, 2021",7/10,"Worth seeing as it tells a dark aspect of WWII that seems as to not be known in foreign countries other than former country-members of Soviet Union. As it comes for the film itself, its artistic side is extraordinary. It has a specific tone with a lot of scenes that are consider to be a metaphorical (or maybe even surreal) way of showing the terror which those people experienced. Moreover, merely the shots with the protagonist's facial expressions, which are highly reminiscent of ""The Scream"" painting, is a great example of both the artistic side and the specific tone.
Highly recommended, especially for war-movies-to-see lists."
Bry-2,"May 17, 2006",10/10,"I habitually use the IMDb to find treasures I might not have seen in my day-to-day movie watching, but am rarely as pleased as I was when I found this film.Come and See is the story of a young man who joins the Byelorussian partisans in their resistance to the invading fascist hordes during World War II. The title comes from the Book of Revelations, according to the director in an introductory interviewed contained in the two-disc DVD I saw.The film is based on a group of incidents observed by A. Adamovich during his youth. Director Klimov also grew up during the Patriotic War, but in the Stalingrad area.Filmed exclusively in Byelorussia, the movie has a wonderful feeling of versimilitude, due to the real locations, the naturalistic acting, the wonderful costumes (many of which are authentic WWII issue uniforms, apparently), and the overall somber tone. Special effects are minimal, most are ""in camera."" Most effective of all may be the scene in which the boy hero and his mentor steal a cow and are then shot at by the Germans -- who are never seen until the final forty minutes or so of the film.Highly recommended, especially if your notion of the War on the Eastern Front is derived from ""Hogan's Heroes"" reruns -- with the comedic threats of getting Sergeant Schultz sent to the Eastern Front as punishment. Even _Stalingrad_ was not as gritty and real as this film."

But what the director Elem Klimov actually is intended to show in the movie is to manifest the permanent physical and psychological changes of war on individuals in a short period of time, in the case of this young boy
Over the period of two days we see the drastic changes not only in his brain but on his face and hair too, as he grows like an old man.Great horrific blasting scenes and
the massacre of the rural people of the village are the best features of this movie; but one of things that is bothering about the movie is this continues image of pitifulness for the boy throughout the movie, in fact the movie doesn't give us a right and neutral picture of the nature of war, there's also a revenge scene at the end of the movie which looks like that the director only wants to cool his audience with, regardless the story line."

searchanddestroy-1,"Jan 31, 2019",10/10,"I comment this awesome war movie, the best ever made - which all the other comments have already described far better than I will do - because I just watched another Russian war movie directed by the wife of the director of this one, Larisa Sheptiko made herself another masterpiece: THE ASCENT for which Elem Klimov - her husband - gives here a sort of tribute to. Very similar topic if you watch closely. They are not just propaganda war films, as were so many USSR features describing the horrors of the Russian front. COME AND SEE and THE ASCENT just told the real truth about the atrocities that the Nazis commited. Because I consider that showing the regular German and Russian armies fighting against each other on the front doesn't require to point out who are the good and who are the evil guys. That's my own opinion. How could we here showing the Russian partisans as the bad and the Einsatzgruppen the good ones?"

s3276169,"Jun 18, 2015",10/10,"Come and See is by any definition probably the greatest anti war movie ever made. Its strips away the bravado and flag waving found in a conventional war films and shows in graphic, awful detail, the savage reality of war.This is not a film to come to lightly. Its deeply disturbing and in no small measure upsetting. What it does achieve and it does so humbly and without pretense, is to dissuade anyone from the perspective that war is something to be wanted and embraced.The acting is superb and the story is, sadly, historically accurate. You will never look at war the same way after watching this film. Ten out of ten from me."
claudettecolbert-286-352840,"Feb 9, 2012",N/A,"""Come and See"" director Elem Klimov, takes us to a tiny town called Byelorussia, where we witness two boys digging in the sandy beaches looking for treasure, which turns out to be a gun left from the war between Russia and Germany. Floyra, a young boy from the town, takes his treasure home because with this weapon he can now join the resistance, and stop Germany's invasion. His mother begs him to stay there with her but, he is full of pride and is taken away by the resistance soldiers who help themselves to farm animals.Floyra is led to a camp where resistance troops, laugh and joke about their conquest as they make fun of Hitler. This will be one of two scenes of innocence and laughter in the film, because the twists and turns that occur through out this film are shocking and horrifying. The photography and landscape are sometimes soothing, until the Germans bombs saturate the forest in their quest to kill the resistance fighters. With this occurrence Floyra's life is turned upside down, and he will be forced to learn what ever it takes to survive the atrocities committed by the Germans. In addition, he does survive, but he is forever changed. I won't spoil the film by telling you all that occurs, but it is a must see. This film manages to affect all the senses, smelling, hearing etc. This telling of the bravery it takes to keep your sense of respect and honor is what this film truly reveals. I was not prepared for this film, as I am a devout fan of comedy. This is a film my professor prefers to show in each of his classes, and I agree that we should all see this eye-opening film of the fight that a little town with a big desire for freedom can accomplish. One more note is that the movie poster says it all, in just one photo."
nathanseg,"Jul 27, 2011",10/10,"Films such as"" Come and See"" can mark people's mind to the point of affecting a government's decision; thus it wouldn't be surprising if Klimov's brutal, breathtaking, and above all, truthful depiction of atrocities committed during the last World War influenced the Soviet leaders not to enter into a third World War at the time the movie was made. Klimov provides a sample of the horrors committed by the Nazis on Soviet civilians during their invasion; the dreadful experience of watching the film is fueled by Klimov's unsettling, but effective, mise en scene shaped by a Soviet approach to film making. Indeed, in order to reproduce historical events in a realist manner, Klimov has used unorthodox, but highly efficient methods, such as shooting animals or hypnotizing the main actor. The heritage of Soviet cinematographic philosophy is also present in a scene in which an ominous bird walks around the two young characters before the arrival of the Nazis; previous Soviet filmmaker such as Eisenstein understood that metaphorical images –such as a dreadful bird or the accidental crush of eggs –had as much impact on the audience as details advancing the plot.""Come and See"" is particularly relevant to people considering joining the army or any person in favor of declaring war to another nation. Florya's experience is representative of what could be anyone's journey through war. First, the boy is excited at the idea of participating and has a glorified image of combat. Although he sets his mind to engage in battle, it is war that comes to him. Klimov shows us that, during War time, no component of one's life is spared: family, friendship, romantic love, even leadership are all pulverized by the atrocities of war. Thus, his mother and sisters are assassinated; his new comrades are killed by mines and sub gun machines; Glasha –like the second girl appearing in the film –is probably raped; even Kossach is haunted by atrocious nightmares.As horrendous scenes unfold, the public cannot help but to ask: why such inhuman behavior? It is towards the end that Kossach, looking ""through"" the audience, tells us to ""listen attentively"". The answer comes from a Nazi who makes us understand that German treatments were devoid of humanity for the unconceivable, yet simple, reason that they did not see certain people –the communists in that case- as fellow human beings.Symbolically, the last shot going upward starting from the bottom of the trees comes in contrast with the first shot of the trees going downward starting from the top ; these opposite camera movements contrast the Nazi invasion with the Soviet riposte. Indeed, the German soldiers were ordered by their leader to ""come down"" on the Soviet Union whereas the Soviet's counterattack is orchestrated by common men –such as Florya –eager to defeat the invaders –with the help from the blessed Russian snow, falling –in the last shot –in a holistic manner on the lens."

And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."" This 1985 anti-war film directed by Elem Klimov opens with two boys playing at war, but in a terrifyingly surreal manner, heightened by the younger boy emitting grotesque, chilling words that sound more beastlike than human. A hyper-realistic quality inhabits the entire film, made more horrifying by sound design which sounds as if we are experiencing everything through 14 yr old Flyora's eyes AND ears...there are sounds that occur throughout...both identifiable and all too realistic, but just as often not identifiable but sounding alive/organic, what cringing or squeamish might shound like...or like life slipping away. Aleksei Kravchenko* who plays Flyora has an incredibly expressive face ...and closeups force us to feel what he's feeling. The entire film was mesmerizingly painful. I'm going to have to go read up on the cinematographer and sound design to try to understand how that contributed mightily to feeling submerged into, suffused with and overwhelmed by Flyora's experience. *In reading through Critereon's ""ComeAndSee_press-notes_r1_original.pdf"", I just learned that Kravchenko ""had never appeared in a film before""...astonishing given his masterful performance in this film...in fact none of the characters were professional actors."
monastiraki,"Oct 10, 2025",8/10,"If anyone finds the argument exaggerated, let them think that today's Gaza is the 1943's Belarus.It seems that war with drones is a cleaner one, but is the same cruelty. I say that, because someone can find this film unrealistic. If not in your TV, you can find images in the Internet. It seems that we never learn the lesson..."
kessler_aungst,"Dec 17, 2007",10/10,"See this movie! It's fantastic. From the haunting soundtrack to the enigmatic characters, it is definitely worth your time, whether you are a war movie fan or not. This film breathes with a fierce realism that is unparalleled in most war movies. I am so impressed by the portrayal of a time in history that has always been so interesting to me. The camera movements achieved in this film are excellently executed and fitted to the emotional content within each scene. Going through the journey with the protagonist will leave you with a feeling of devastation, horror, and disbelief. There are numerous scenes in this film that will always stay with me and remind me of how simplicity is often the best way to approach a movie."
slicemaster,"Feb 19, 2009",10/10,"This film is ""must see"" category. And it's clearly propaganda. A good one. An excellent one. If U looking for some eye-candy or funny tale it's not here. Nobody going to entertain You. But You can be sure, once You watch it, You will find feelings. And not a pleasure one. But hell as intensive. Personally I'v felt so much anger of helplessness i can describe.In ex/USSR there is and was a ""little"" problem ""Few deaths - tragedy, millions - statistic"" (Stalin don't said that BTW) I't common knowledge that Germans killed millions of russians in WW2, burned villages and ets. Common knowledge from one side, and unimaginable scale from over side. As match, as it loose it's own sense. That's why this film was shown to as many school-kids as possible in USSR at times.If U would see throw through comments here U will see that it mostly quite polar. ""Very good"" or ""Very bad"". It's simple. It shows people who let themselves to feel the meanings of film, and who don't. I understand the second ones. It's not the feelings, U normally want to feel. To distant yourself is as natural as move the hand away from knife blade. And to people who says ""it is unlikely dramatized"", ""I don't by it"", ets, I should remind, that author live himself through such as these. And what is shown was far not the cruelest that was in real history.""IDI I SMOTRY"" helps to understand what is it means: ""ethnical cleaning"",""guerilla warfare"" as good as it possible for film. U wanna know it? Come and see!P.S. I oftern see in reveiws ""it is unrealistic"" and latest ""german soldiers not behave like that"". I'm 42years old Russians. Iknow at least 4 people PERSONALLY whos relatives survived under fire or saw how people were killed by german soldiers. As civilians. On purpose. By regular troops, not SS. Including my father when he was 4 year old.
German soldiers did behaved like that."
markbeau,"Jun 25, 2013",9/10,"Drive-ins & youth. Today Google's opening page honors Drive-in's 79th anniversary with a bubble-gum pink 'Admit One' ticket see-sawing in front of a sign that reads oogle. Last night I saw one of the most unforgettable films of my viewing life, which got me to thinking.The power of film! I am still reeling from an unconventional movie made in 1985 called ""Come and See."" Not since my younger brother and teenage me saw Jaws at a Galveston drive-in (double-billed with Capone) and next day had to build courage to step into the Gulf, has a film disturbed me so.I gave the film a chance because 1) It was on the AFI top 250 list and I never heard of it, 2) The filmmaker tells the story of a young boy. Ever since Mark Twain and Harper Lee, I'm a fan of stories told from a child's point of view about adult experiences. Come and See is a startling tell.After a vile runt of a boy shouts invectives to his tall likable friend, the camera rolls with two excited Russian boys as they search for a forgotten battlefield. They pull up war gear and rifles deep from the sands of an overrun Russian position of the unstoppable German invasion of 1941. The runt dons found Nazi battle gear, imitating a meanness that he believes will suit the German occupiers he later meets. The eldest boy carries home a Russian rifle to join the Partisans. He charms away his little twin sisters and anxious mother to run off a meet them. The Partisans reject the hopeful lad along with their favorite pretty girl mascot. Sending the innocents home from their forest camp, the Partisans head for the front. The boy and girl share disappointment of their rejection. The next day, left alone, they enjoy an idyllic time until the look to the sky. Strange parachutes open, the SS descend, and the boy and girl face their helpless fate together.At first it is uncomfortable to see actors and actresses emote deadpan, full frame, directly into the lens. But the director does not want you to be comfortable with the subject - and focuses us on this - one extermination of over six hundred villages in Belorussia. The focal length is short, making the actress cross-eyed, adding a sense of idiocy to her naivety of the world.You can forgive the film for some too-long takes because the pacing sets you up for a final thirty minute run which is perhaps the most breathtaking, non-stop war scene ever filmed. The uniforms and obscure gear are entirely authentic of 1943. Some of the scenes are genius - a flash that we see with the girl that would mean everything to the boy as they are fleeing. After some courage, she utters the image in short words. The rolling camera has more juice than the napalm & helicopter Ride-of-the-Valkyries vertical assault in Apocalypse Now!, or the terror of the Omaha Beach landing in Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. The camera rolls and floats with the endless victory of cruelty, shear madness, and horror that a few actors actually experienced in the invasion of their homeland in World War Two.There are few predictable moments. Sometimes you get stuck in a scene with a Quentin Tarantino cruelty we must endure. At other moments there is a Fellini-esque vitality of raw moments that I have never seen in a Hollywood depiction of war. There is no stand-out villain Nazi like Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds, the entire mixed-German platoon wheels an invisible zeal of distinct beer house characters - except they are dead sober, being at war for years. The film is a marvelous intertwining of direction (Elem Klimov), writing (Ales Adamovich), and cinematography (Alexei Rodionov). The actors may have been over their heads, for how can a boy credibly act, react, and emote such witness. The unsettling soundtrack and original music complete the film's psychological pacing. I admire a film shown from a young boy's point of view that avoids the easy way out of first person narrative overdubs. Raw images, raw acting all the way. This is a cinema experience no US teenager will ever experience from a car seat. And that is unfortunate, not because this is one of the early heroic uses of a steadicam when they weighed 100 pounds, but because you walk away feeling in your gut the horror of something that really happened to us, the human race."
ibrahimkhan-30185,"Mar 29, 2022",9/10,"Amazing film amazing directed . Watched horror of war and I imagine how would like with those poor souls who died like that .Starting of movie maybe slow but it's amazing till end so close and felt like real war ,never watched that kind of movie.Of course saving private Ryan was one one best movie but this was some thing else."
katyusharac,"Nov 24, 2009",10/10,"First of all, Come and See explains the violence and cruelty of War never falling to agitation or exaggeration. Film shows what had happened during WW2 with all of its reality. It is worth to see violence and inhumanity of Germans (not Nazis) and sense of humor of Russians. It is very ironic finding an empty vodka bottle in the forest. Film is only reason why I am hating Germans.Come and See is better than Saving Private Ryan. Acting of Aleksei Kravchenko is legendary.I felt myself as I was living in Belarus during WW2 which was invaded by Germans. It is the director's ability. It is very disappointing that babies being killed could not have find chance of living."
Daniel Karlsson,"May 12, 2003",4/10,"I strongly disagree about this movie being a piece of art. Maybe the ending sequence, but that's about it. I was very disappointed by this film due to the high IMDb rating. It feels like the director wants to be Tarkovsky; but he isn't. Filled with flaws and clichés as well as being propagandistic and biased. Could have been much better. The intro is weak and all through the movie there is a lack of framing. Music could have been used in a much better way. The only really good thing I found was the camera movement which were pretty realistic and made the movie captivating at times. As a whole though, this movie is far from a masterpiece in my opinion. I believe there are much better Russian films and much better war films.2/5"
natasha_c5,"Jun 3, 2012",10/10,"I am not only speaking for myself, I am speaking for many of you out there when I say that this movie makes such an impact on you and leaves a scar of an unforgettable story.It is not an antiwar movie, it is just a genuine portray of what war is all about. Without any censoring you get to experience the young boy Florian's horrific journey in Belarus throughout World War 2 where 628 villages were brutally and inhumanly destroyed by the Nazis. The most powerful impact about this movie is how the young boy's appearance changes during the course of the movie, before your eyes he literally changes and looks like an old man in the end.I was left speechless for a while, never before has a movie made me use all my five senses, made me feel, smell and hear every second of the film. Elem Klimov is brilliant in the way that when you are just telling yourself ""it is just a film"" he takes you right back to Florian's atrocious reality."
tararockstar,"Dec 10, 2007",8/10,I think this movie was amazing. I think that there has been a lot of films that have been made about the time of Hitler and the tremendous tragedy that all felt. The way this film portrayed this time in history made you feel deeper than any film I have seen before. Your heart always hurts when you hear about the war but this film makes you feel like you are there experiencing it in the moment. I also enjoyed the parts of the film that were almost dreamlike and surreal and you wonder if the characters are floating to another reality or if this was reality and the insanity that was happening around them was a dream. I loved its raw beauty and tragedy. I highly recommend this film.
clavi012000,"Dec 17, 2007",9/10,"This movie invites you to see, or witness the atrocities of WWll. The story is about a young boy named Floyra who witnesses the events that happened in villages in Russia. The young boy comes of age in a very hell-like way. He witnesses many, or all of the things that happened in the war. He returns to his village after being taken to be part of a resistance and finds nothing there. Throughout the film, he stares at the camera inviting you to keep watching; an invitation that everyone takes but doesn't like. Personally, I felt very disturbed by all of the events that the young boy goes through. His face is one that is not easily forgotten. His lips are dry, his eyes look dead. The last scene shows news reels of the Nazi troops and people cheering and Hitler; all going backwards. That scene alone makes you wonder how could people allow something like that happen and how could a little boy grow up to massacre so many people?"
ota_jimamao,"Dec 10, 2010",10/10,"I had a nightmare after watching this movie. With many shocking scenes, the movie describes the REAL. The movie absolutely is branded on your memory, and it doesn't let you go. This is something very important you should watch and understand before supporting the War in Iraq. This is absolute realism. On the other hand, you never meet such a movie in Hollywood. A young boy gradually understands the real during the war. What he experiences is pretty dramatic: death of his family, many of dead bodies, slaughter, rape, and many paralyzed hearts. His experience represents the victims. This is not a propaganda movie that make particular country look great, but tells that the war creates losses. The movie doesn't entertain you, but it educates and cultivates you."
wasabiteabag,"Jun 10, 2021",10/10,"...via a low quality YouTube upload.This film has been sitting in my watchlist for a few years now. Forever checking if it's available to rent/buy/stream in Australia. Every time, a big nope. Today I finally gave in for a 480p version on a 4K OLED TV.I'm grateful for the low quality in hindsight, the loss in detail might have been a silver lining filter to the gruesome realism depicted on screen. Every shot put the viewer in the kids rotten 2nd hand shoes, made us walk with him through the nightmare. We follow Flyora, played by the brilliant Aleksey Kravchenko at just 13 years of age at the time. We slowly see this boy lose his faith in humanity as he experiences first had the atrocities of war. He ages 20yrs in 2hrs. It's absolutely insane.This is an anti-war film, the only way war films should be retold. Almost documentary like. No one is glorified or happy here. It's a must see, as a reminder of how fragile and violent humans can be."
jose-cruz53,"Sep 29, 2012",1/10,"The best thing I can say is: watch Grave of the Fireflies instead, it is one million times better, more realistic and is not as biased as this film.Come and See is a WW2 film about the horrors of war. However, it is not remotely as good as people seem to think it is. I found it terribly mediocre and extremely boring. The characters lacked real emotion and the sadness seemed really forced, each character behaved in a very strange manner and nobody looked like real people. Instead they moved around like corpses without emotion.Also, the cinematography looks very amateurish, as if I had shoot this film at my backyard. The soundtrack is boring, without any decent music at all.And I liked some Russian movies, like those by Tarkovsky, which are monumental pieces of art.Besides being a failure as a film it is also a piece of Soviet propaganda. Indeed, it shows WW2 as ""the nice Soviets versus the evil Germans"", however, that is ludicrous. They depict the German soldiers as Nazi devils without any hint of humanity and driven by the sole purpose of exterminating the Soviet population. However, the truth is that German soldiers were people just like the Soviet civilians and while there were a few psychopaths in the SS, the vast majority were normal people.Indeed, this is not a realistic film in any way, shape or form. Saving Private Ryan is also very unrealistic, but in another way. Both films fail to attain realism and depict the war in a satisfactory way. Both firms have an anti-German bias and a nationalistic bias. The general problem with WW2 films is that any film made in a country that won the war tends to have nationalistic biases and so they tend to be really offensive and become implicit propaganda. This movie is not implicit propaganda, it is explicit propaganda of the Soviet regime, which had Joseph Stalin at its helm at the time, a murderous regime equal to Nazi Germany in their lack of humanity.The good WW2 films are always German or Japanese. Since losing the war make them more humble and they don't tend to depict their enemies as inhuman monsters.Its propaganda, devoid of any artistic merit. I give it the minimum score because of its extreme pro-Soviet bias, which makes the film offensive and indeed Soviet propaganda. Ignoring the bias I would give 5/10, since it is a mildly interesting film for WW2 buffs.Obs.: I have not seem 100% of the film, in the middle parts I slept for 20 minutes, due to its boring nature."
jefflived,"May 23, 2021",10/10,"And there will NEVER be this forgiveness as long as the terrible truth of war is passed down from generation to generation!And we, who live today, have no right to forget about it!

PeriodDramaFan88,"Jun 11, 2021",10/10,"This movies is pretty personal for me since my grandma's village in Belarus was burned down in a similar manner as depicted in this film. Although it is very hard to watch I think everyone should find the strength to experience this very moving, dark, and scary film!"
Naoufel_Boucetta,"Jan 12, 2021",10/10,"DevastatingMore than a film, this is a horror documentary that presents veraciously the nightmare of war. With its phenomenal work of cinematography and sound engineering Come and See brings the true image of the madness, the terror, the sorrow and the pain that comes with war. A monumental performance by Aleksey Kravchenko, And also an insane amount of effort by the film crew. A masterwork"
tobydale,"Oct 23, 2021",10/10,"Have just re-watched Come and See for the first time in many years.Forget the Holywood blockbusters like Saving Private Ryan et al; clichéd and ""for entertainment"". Some movies (very few) go beyond sanitised versions of war. Some movies are not ""for entertainment"". Come and See is one of them.Where do you start with a film like this?First of all; it's a breathtaking portrayal of a place and time that we cannot know, nor would ever want to. Extraordinary and beyond shocking.I suppose that Come and See is classed as a ""war film"", but it is so much more than that. It makes so many statements and uses so many devices in the story-telling that it rises fully above categorisation in any genre.There is innocence, revulsion, horror, incalculable evil. The viewer is confronted with the prospect of becoming a young Belarus partisan in 1943. We see what he sees, experience what he experiences. It is well beyond our comprehension. We are taken to a place where there is pure undiluted terror.Come and See is a masterwork in psychological filmaking. We are brutalised in sitting though it. Our knowledge of the human condition and what we are capable of is expanded through work of this nature.One of the greatest movies of all time."
dvl12,"Oct 21, 2017",10/10,"This movie captivates to tell us the story of Belarus during WWII. Simply mesmerizing, brutally real, highly visual truth. It doesn't leave a good impression, but it shows how broad human nature is. Both, the evil and the good. Highly recommend watching it to anyone interested in history and the art of filmmaking."
supatube,"Jan 25, 2023",4/10,"It's good...ish but because it has such a notorious reputation I was expecting so much more. I was expecting to be captivated. I expected open mouth staring at the screen. I expected Tarkovsky meets Lynch. I got bored. Over and over again. Felt like I was caught in a Minghella film - overhyped, over decorated and boring.First it doesn't feel like reality. Everything seems stilted and obviously posed. The film carries a heavy symbolic theme that I find it strange people say this is like real war. It's surrealist so... yeah, totally confused there. What was based in reality? Location shooting? The few bullets? The few explosions? The dirt?Second, the acting, I can't help but disagree. The acting is so off I couldn't help myself from giggling. Felt like a priest was phrasing things weird in church and I'm not allowed to laugh because it serious. It's not good in my opinion. It's corny. Really corny, childish acting. Very sad, very mad, very glad.I had to watch this film in three sittings. I lost interest, went back, tried to pay attention and stop giggling alas to no avail I giggled myself to sleep. Twice. If this film is based in reality then I know how I would have died in WWII - boredom."
stefankrs,"Sep 7, 2021",10/10,"This film is a WWII film showing the true horrors and effects of the war. Watching this movie is like it was filmed during WWII it feels completely real and it is terrifying. This film had great practical effects with the bombs and gunfire which was real to add to the realism. It wasn't afraid of being brutal either, showing the terrible things the nazis did. The acting is completely superb from the main actor he genuinely looked horrified. This movie is the greatest war movie movie of all time."
JoelChamp85,"Mar 19, 2021",9/10,"This film hints both at what humans are capable of and what we can endure. It's big, in a real way, with mass extras and practical effects. The Nazis act like they're on a pub crawl from town to town wreaking havoc and creating entertainment. In reality these events deeply disturbed a lot of the German soldiers, hence inventing the gas chambers. Very well made and the use of constant portrait close-ups harness the raw emotions."
tameradelkamal,"Oct 7, 2021",9/10,Very strange the movie not even nominated for oscars best foreign language and this movie is much better than Oscar best picture movie winner out of Africa.
justinfashola,"Feb 3, 2022",9/10,"""Come and See"" was a really eye-opening movie for some brainwashed war-loving people. It shows the true moral of war. The victims, the genocide, the countless murders, ...
Nobody wins in such a conflict. Everybody loses. And some lose everything. Watch it and you'll see war in a different way I guarantee you that."
eeversol,"Jun 8, 2008",10/10,"Elem Klimov is absolutely relentless in the direction, tone, and physical production of Come And See. Combining real time long takes, overwhelming audio, and journalistic acting the audience is forcefully put into the protagonists POV. The viewer endures bouts of earsplitting blows followed by lengthy deaf periods. These periods take place over endless shots while instilling a palpable ambiance to the scene.A story that historically receives less credit than it deserves is told with brilliant direction, photography, and acting (a rarity these days). Its cinematic worth is proved time and time again as it influences directors like Spielberg in their blockbuster productions."
