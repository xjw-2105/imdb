0U,"Feb 20, 2020",6/10,I think this movie suffered from lack of a good script and bad acting.
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nov 26, 2008",5/10,"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10"
The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Nov 21, 2008",4/10,"NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of ""so bad it's ALMOST good"". Yes, I just invented that category.The 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.Okay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.As far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good."
taj-james-holmes,"May 9, 2020",7/10,"There's an atmosphere to Twilight and that much you simply cannot deny. I can't help but be engrossed by the way that this movie captures the beauty, dreariness and nature of the Pacific Northwest. A memorable score and soundtrack heighten Catherine Hardwicke's broody, yet still enchanting tone. Elliot Davis' cinematography under her direction replicates the indie flair prominent in her other features, this is what separates it apart from the commercially realised sequels that followed. It's a hot and cold, gothic romance with just enough high stakes to enchant you until the very end. If it's raining, you can best believe that I'm slipping into something comfortable and putting Twilight on."
black_heart_night,"Feb 26, 2009",3/10,"Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great."
hazeleng,"Aug 7, 2018",10/10,"If I saw the movie now for the first time I know I probably will hate it, but the 11 year old me was so love struck with it. Honestly no movie these days makes me this happy anymore. Also I think this one (the first movie) is so much cinematically pleasing. I enjoy the dark blue rainy vibe & the shaky camera a lot. This movie is my guilty pleasure. 10 for the nostalgia feelings."
a-07779-75123,"Aug 15, 2020",7/10,"This is awesome part of franchise ""Twilight"" because gteat atmosphere, cool soundtrack."
tiggyjokneale,"May 17, 2020",8/10,"This movie deserves an 8 purely for the soundtrack - one of the best movie sound tracks EVER (in my opinion) and beautiful scenery and cinematography. sure, the acting isn't great, nor is the script writing, however this movie is an enjoyable watch and a romance classic"
AnnaShade,"Nov 21, 2008",N/A,"I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a film. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight fans. I probably won't ever want to see it again, but it's okay at midnight with some school friends who like it or something."
abphadore,"Jun 19, 2024",7/10,"Twilight, directed by Catherine Hardwicke and based on the best-selling novel by Stephenie Meyer, is a 2008 romantic fantasy film that has garnered both passionate fans and vocal critics. Starring Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan and Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, the film explores the intense and forbidden romance between a teenage girl and a vampire.Plot and Setting:
The story follows Bella Swan, a 17-year-old who moves to the small, rainy town of Forks, Washington, to live with her father. There, she becomes fascinated by the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen, a student at her high school who turns out to be a vampire. As Bella and Edward fall deeply in love, they must navigate the dangers that come with their relationship, including the threat posed by other vampires.Performances:
Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Bella is characterized by her understated and often introspective performance, which some viewers found relatable and genuine, while others perceived it as lackluster. Robert Pattinson brings a brooding intensity to Edward Cullen, capturing the character's internal struggle and romantic allure. Their on-screen chemistry, while sometimes awkward, effectively conveys the magnetic pull between their characters.Direction and Cinematography:
Catherine Hardwicke's direction emphasizes the moody and atmospheric tone of the Pacific Northwest setting. The film's cinematography, with its muted color palette and frequent use of natural light, enhances the ethereal and otherworldly feel of the story. Notable scenes, such as the iconic meadow sequence and the thrilling baseball game, are visually striking and memorable.Soundtrack and Score:
The film's soundtrack, featuring artists like Muse, Paramore, and Linkin Park, plays a significant role in establishing its emotional and youthful vibe. Carter Burwell's score, particularly the haunting ""Bella's Lullaby,"" complements the film's romantic and dramatic moments, adding depth to the narrative.Themes and Reception:
Twilight explores themes of love, identity, and the struggle between desire and self-control. Its portrayal of a love that transcends the ordinary resonates with many viewers, particularly its target teenage audience. However, the film has also faced criticism for its portrayal of romance, with some arguing that it promotes an unhealthy dynamic and idealizes problematic behavior.Cultural Impact:
Despite its polarizing reception, Twilight has had a significant cultural impact. It sparked a global phenomenon, leading to a successful film franchise, merchandise, and a dedicated fanbase. The film also played a pivotal role in the careers of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, propelling them to international stardom.Conclusion:
Twilight is a film that elicits strong reactions, both positive and negative. Its blend of romance, fantasy, and teen drama struck a chord with a vast audience, making it a cultural touchstone of the late 2000s. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, its appeal lies in its ability to tap into the emotions and fantasies of its viewers. Whether you love it or loathe it, Twilight remains a significant entry in the landscape of young adult adaptations, leaving an indelible mark on pop culture."
corneliaklumpp,"Mar 7, 2020",10/10,"Perhaps I Have to tell something so that people who hate this film do understand why I review like this. My Dad died in 2008 when Twilight aired. I watched the movie again and again. And today, I still watch it again and again. I always have problems when I read a book and they made a movie of it. Because most of the time the movie just sucks. But not with the Twilight movies. They are like the books, and this without a big budget. So if you have a hard time and you need a simple but nice movie to watch to leave into another world. Please watch this."
roedyg,"Sep 26, 2014",7/10,"As a gay 66 year old man, I am clearly not part of the intended audience for this film, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.The film is filled with handsome teenage males, and many homely ugly- Betty goonily-dressed females, including the lead Bella. The boys either strut around looking pretty, with blank expressions, like runway models, or they act like silly hyper active grade 4 school boys. The boys are so inept in their attempts to impress the girls. Bella rudely dismisses them all with a look that says, ""You have got to be kidding. You thought I would have anything to do with you?""Bella is cranky, rude, not very bright, without interests, hobbies or talents. However, she is new to the school, which gives her some appeal.Edward, is considered the ultimate dreamboat by all the girls, but he allegedly considers himself too good for any of them. I thought the explanation was that he gay, but it turned it out was because he was a vampire.All the ugly girls get cute boyfriends in the end, but that fantasy- fulfilment story is very much in the background.To my great surprise the plot of the first half of the film unfolds with the ponderousness of a Jane Austen novel. I never expected that from a teen movie. There is great push pull between Edward and Bella. Edward is trying to control his urges to kill Bella and drink her blood. Bella blithely ignores what he is telling her. The reticence builds an incredible tension. It is similar to the sort of tension people in an earlier day felt trying to avoid sex before marriage or gay sex.What makes no sense is why Edward is attracted to Bella but not the other girls. I decided to pretend it had to do with scent or some vampire-only discernible attribute. The real reason has to do with fantasy fulfilment.Robert Pattinson does a brilliant job of portraying Edward the vampire. His approach is similar to Stephen Moyer playing the courtly vampire Bill Compton in True Blood. He is calm, patient, breathy, intense, old- fashioned. He is handsome, but in an almost non-human sort of way.At one point he says roughly, ""I am the most dangerous predator on the planet. Even my face, by voice and my scent are designed to lure victims."" You look at him, and imagine his exotic scent, he is speaking literal truth. It is like an electric shock. Photographs of him are not sufficient to show what I am talking about.Like the Superman I movie, Edward gradually reveals his powers to Bella. Unlike Lois Lane, Bella is completely unimpressed.The movie shifts gears to comedy, when Edward takes Bella home to meet the ""family"".Then the movie shifts gears again, stealing the special effects from Superman II, where the titans battle.Bella always chooses the most dangerous possible thing to do at each stage. It obviously helps the plot, but it made me want to smack her for being so stupid.Bella within almost minutes of meeting Edward decided she wants marry him. Then a week or so later she decides even marriage is not sufficient commitment. The want him to commit for eternity of life as a vampire. The belief that there was only one true love for me caused me untold misery. I might even go so far as to say it ruined my life. I hate seeing that poison being sold to unsuspecting young girls."
pyrocitor,"Dec 7, 2008",4/10,"After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels.Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film.However, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the ""Harry Potter syndrome"", feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow.But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary.The film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his ""sultry, moody glances"" delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through ""stern but absent father"" clichés to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob.While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to cliché and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy.-4/10"
angievlismas,"Nov 12, 2022",10/10,"Absolute lover of twilight. Really brings out the best in all of us. Recreates the literature great saga in a way that makes me still want to have a marathon 14 years on. Impeccable acting, lighting, outfit choices and scenes. I was originally team Jacob, then Edward... but now I have realised that all along I have been #teamcharlie. This saga makes me feel wild like a rat.To top it all off, the way the cast absolutely despise this movie and the franchise as a whole really makes the balance of watching this satirically vs seriously quite perfect! Would recommend for anyone with mild anxiety who needs to have their daily dopamine fix."
I_Ailurophile,"Apr 12, 2022",7/10,"To say that 'Twilight' carries baggage is a dire understatement. The books' reputation precedes them, carrying questionable writing and strong themes of abusive relationships, and it's impossible to watch the movies in 2022 without being aware of much derided special effects, acting, and more. At the same time, one tries to approach movies with an open mind, and it's important to recognize in the first place that these titles were written for a ""young adult"" audience, and all the horrid awkwardness that immediately greets us with scenes of high school age characters is actually very fitting, for good or ill. And secondly - there are a lot of recognizable performers here that have more than proven their capabilities elsewhere, before or and or since; I think most viewers should be well-rounded enough to recognize that even the best actors, given poor material to work with, will look bad in a lackluster feature.I don't think 2008 film 'Twilight' is especially great. However, I'm frankly astonished to find myself thinking it's not nearly as bad as everyone has made it out to be in the past 14 years. Here's the thing: all the ham-handedness, the overt and kitschy flourishes, the bluntness - and above all the stilted and gawky writing, acting, and otherwise execution - doesn't feel accidental. It's bewildering as a movie-goer, absolutely, and hard to swallow, and to whatever extent the approach here was intentional, I don't think it was pulled off with all due success. Yet this is a movie about teens, for teens, with supernatural elements forced in, and at the same time that the picture comes across as unnatural and inorganic, nothing actually seems out of place. It's a flummoxing, indelicate balance, distinctly imperfect, and I can't for one moment begrudge anyone who honestly engages with 'Twilight' and dislikes it. For my part, though, speaking as someone who has watched films of all possible styles, genres, quality, value, from silent classics to Asylum mockbusters - I see what this wanted to be, and what it could have been. I can understand and appreciate the ways in which this does work, and those in which it doesn't. If the series were produced not as feature films but as a program on The CW alongside 'Riverdale' or the like, no one would bat an eye. I don't know if it's totally correct to say I like 'Twilight,' but... I get it.Hair and makeup, costume design, Elliot Davis' cinematography, Nancy Richardson's editing, the visual effects, Catherine Hardwicke's direction, filming locations, set design and decoration, the soundtrack - almost every possible aspect of the production design and art direction, more often than not, is painfully gauche, overdone, and a bit of a burden to bear. That's not to say that it's outright bad; sometimes a particular shot or scene is actually rather fetching, and were more care taken at large I can see where they would have fit in a title of greater repute. Artless as it may sometimes be, it's not sloppy.Of course, again, much has been made of the acting. To be frank: especially knowing what the cast are capable of, what I see in watching this are actors who worked with what they were given. At risk of repeating myself, the overwhelming awkwardness that pervades the picture from the very start is built into the characters and their interactions, the setting, the scenario, and every little detail, for better or for worse. In a story about young love, new friends, uncertainty, and personal and interpersonal conflict, all the somewhat halting, forced, or artificial expressions, movement, or delivery don't seem entirely wrong - but instead, kind of appropriate. Director Hardwicke has some noteworthy credits to her name, and if occasionally her contribution here is lacking, when it comes to guiding her cast, I think she was rather on point. Once more, it's a very fine line the production walks, an uneasy balancing act of ""just right"" that ever risks slipping into oafish gracelessness. Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Billy Burke, Nikki Reed, Anna Kendrick, and everyone else on hand did their best with what they had. None of the performances here are great - but by no means do I think they're altogether rotten.And that leaves the writing. Though I have certainly heard much about Stephanie Meyer's books, I freely admit I haven't read the source material, and I can only make assume that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay is reasonably faithful. It's worth noting as well that Rosenberg has a considerable number of credits and indeed accolades to her name. The same facets I've described with 'Twilight' broadly certainly apply here, too, as the dialogue and characters vary between tawdrily brusque and direct, inelegantly clumsy and unrefined, and or what feels like is simply suitable. The scene writing, informed by Meyer's own, similarly has some bright spots, while at times struggles with contrivance. However, I also get a sense that this is just one of the difficulties of telling a YA-supernatural romance story; I find it hard to imagine there are many ways of showing scenes of Bella and Edward's blossoming love, or the demonstrations of his powers, that wouldn't come off as strained and cringe-worthy. And the overall narrative has problems in the small details, and above all treads murky territory with the questionably handled overtones of domestic violence and abuse. Yet the bare essence of the tale - a human mingling with ""creatures of the night"" - is classic, with familiar themes, and is no less worthy just because of the high school setting. In the wide strokes, I think the screenplay is just fine.What I think it all comes down to is that this is a movie that, beyond the presumed target audience of teen girls, is best left for those viewers who are wholly receptive to all the wonderful, weird, wild, or woeful possibilities that cinema has to offer. I genuinely believe that 2008's 'Twilight' is quite far from a bad movie - but I also readily recognize that I say this from a place of having done my best to find the value herein. Apart from the thematic material in regards to relationships, the biggest issue I see are the special effects - done well such as they are, but not considered at the storyboard stage with particular mindfulness. Everything else, from writing, acting, and directing, down to the slightest rounding elements, are ""okay"" or ""apt"" but constantly border on tactless or unsophisticated. For what it tried to do, and be, I think 'Twilight' was more of a success than not, but it tripped over its own two left feet a little bit too much for it not to be noticeable. Color me surprised, though - I can't say I wasn't entertained."
Littlechicky_hotstuff,"Nov 28, 2008",3/10,"Okay, I just got back from watching ""Twilight"" and I must say, cheesiest, choppiest, worst characterization of a movie I have seen in years and by far the worst Book adaptation I've ever seen! It even beat my discontentment with Ella Enchanted.As avid readers, we do not go to a movie to see ""surprises"" or script changes! We go to the movie to see our favorite books displayed out in front of us to see how our minds and visuals compare.Bella was suppose to be funny, she was way too bloody serious! Kristen go get some facial expressions, terror is not love and looking insensitive all the time is not what the character Bella is all about! She's so clumsy it's funny, she's sarcastic, you took out ALL of my favorite lines! And their should have been more chemistry between Jacob and Bella, it's like hey look their vamps, haha now you can leave. She's comical, did you even read the book?Edward, don't' look so constipated all the time. Like jeez you're suppose to be tense, not looking like you had too much carbohydrates and not enough water. Not only that you didn't' portray Edward's genuine gentleman side at all, the loving chivalrous side! And where is that infamous half smile! Honestly i'll make a list for all of your characters! An essay about each and everyone on how readers want them portrayed and what scenes we could do with out.Alice was awesome, Jasper, very nice! Rosalie, hell down pat! Emmet, please face baseball cap forward, it's annoying. actually don't wear hats, Emmet's not wangster and you look hot without it. Carlisle please cause some more fatherly emotion but good! Esme, you do alright.One question plagues me though... WHY WEREN""T THEY GIVEN MORE LINES? Like jeez! I understand your need to save time because no one wants to sit through a six hour movie but if it had to be three and a half hours, we'd enjoy it!Jacob Black, awesome casting!!!! But give him more lines, I saw Tyler Lautner in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, he's a really good actor, ACTUALLY why don't you JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK!! Come on everyone loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I read those books and especially in Harry Potter didn't' have any troubles with their movie adaptations, actually i didn't realized when they changed something! OK maybe some chapters were taken out but it didn't ruin the overall point and it was funny loving and mischievous. I loved those books and those movies.The chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking.I actually didn't care to get up and go bathroom in between, i pretty much didn't' care to miss any of it. THIS IS A POPULAR BOOK! You're adaptation sucked major insignificant crap. I mean just look at your movie rating! For a book that beat Harry Potter's final book, I mean best seller's list and it was Eclipse the second last book of the series and it beat out the final book to HARRY POTTER. Couldn't you have taken a little more time on it. And where was Alice and Jasper and Rosalie and Emmet at the end in the prom scene?I honestly do not care if you continue on with the movies, actually I'd prefer it if you didn't. You have ruined my vision of it, you're killing your fan base. Unless you guys give the next one some extra spark and actually start listening to your fans, you can forget about a wide fan base. I absolutely hated the movie. I felt sorry for those who didn't read the books because they had NO CLUE what was going on it was so choppy!!! I couldn't even tell when the next day started, all of a sudden, Edward ""I would like you to meet my family"" next two minutes, ""wow you have a really nice house..."" um... hello did she sleep? DID I FALL ASLEEP? I think i missed something, oh no wait, you did. It's called nightfall. Where was the talk about twilight? How it is the beginning and ending of a day...? Or about her talking in her sleep. He looked like a weird serial killer stalking her in her sleep. WHERE WERE THE FUNNY PARTS! I had more fun and made my friends laugh by making my own commentary during the film, i even made people i didn't know who sat in front of me in the theater burst out laughing from my commentary then your boring movie did.As readers we expect the book to be taken seriously, and adapted to screen, NOT BASED, ADAPTED!!!!!! I've taken Communication Production Tech class in my high school writing my own scripts, so I know script writing agony, i'm also writing my own book. So if i was to ever sign off my book to make it a screen version I'd make darn sure it took more than a few SLOPPY months to make, with a CAST WHO READ THE BOOK FIRST AND RESEARCHED THEIR CHARACTER! Honestly, can you seriously give me an answer about how many cast members actually, i mean truly read all the books? I'm sure hardly any of them did.This by far is the biggest disappointment I have seen in years and I'm only eighteen.ADAPTION IS NOT THE SAME AS BASED ON!!! PEOPLE HONESTLY! Anyone who says they loved the movie did not care much for the characters or shares the same love as Stephenie Meyer does for her books. This was rushed, unorganized, ill plan, deceitful, and horrid.You're lacking the spunk, zest, fire, passion, integrity, and the complete ethics of what made the TWILIGHT SERIES!"
bob the moo,"Jul 13, 2009",N/A,"There is no point in pretending it – I'm a man in his thirties and I'm not target audience for this film. So the fact that I rented it is just a ""bonus"" few pounds in the pockets of the makers since they clearly weren't aiming this film at me. Who they were aiming it at appears to have been the army of teenage girls who have been reading the Twilight books religiously – again. I'd never even heard of the books so this is really something off my cultural radar. Regardless I decided to give the film a try without really knowing the plot or what it was meant to be. What I found was the first part in a longer story about a human teenager who moves back to her small town and falls for a boy who turns out to be one of a group of teenage vampires who feed off the blood of animals rather than people.I have no problems with the teenage aspect of the story but somehow it really failed to engage me as it was not only too superficial but didn't even really do that particularly well. The film plays like it has been written around events without a great deal of depth, complexity or characterisation in it, which is a surprise considering the fertile ground the world of teenage love and acceptance is. Sadly it comes off all too bland and obvious for my tastes and I rarely could bring myself to care about what was going on. The direction is a bit too serious at times but it also lacks passion and the breathlessness that the material suggests it must have once had if it did captivate a teenage audience. Of course I could be just missing the point because perhaps the cast are a big part of it working and this is lost on me.Certainly the appeal of much of the cast is lost on me totally. Stewart has something about her but cannot translate it into something meaningful here, leaving her character feeling a bit one-dimensional. However compared to Pattinson she looks like one of the finest actresses of her generation because he is about as dull and vapid as he could have been without trying. OK maybe his immortal, unsleeping character has to have something weirdly ""dead"" about him but this should not be a detrimental part of his performance as it is here. I shan't bother to list those below them because nobody really captured my interest in terms of their characters or performances.Twilight is not a bad film, it is just a very bland one that lacks passion, heart or excitement. Maybe the target audience will strongly disagree (I'd be shocked if they did not) but having watched this for myself I fail to see what not only the fuss is about – but why anyone would really consider this to be a good film."
Xstal,"Aug 24, 2022",6/10,"What would you do, if a vampire captures you, sends your heart into a spin, vessels bursting out your skin, only drawback is he's keen, to suck the life out of your spleen, though he'll hold back at his leisure, to ensure you get your pleasure, competition soon arrives, puts your man in overdrive, all the passion and the gory, to lay claim to all your glory."
PrincessHotDog,"Feb 21, 2023",10/10,"10/10 sorry but it's so iconic.I think the first movie is the best from all. The atmosphere, the colour palette, the costumes, the details, the music (omg the music is so fantastic) and the most important is the landscape, the nature its all giving THE VIBE.The acting well not the best but honestly I can deal with that cause all the things that I listed above saving the whole movie.Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson such an iconic duo. To be honest I'm so happy to see that after this saga they went to another movies, genres and proved that they have so much talent. I think it was such a learning curve for the actors."
dreamflower530,"Nov 21, 2008",6/10,"I just got back from a midnight premiere, and the movie blew me away. I'm an avid book lover and college lit major and VERY hard to impress as far as book to screen adaptations go. I have NO complaints! (Take that mom and best friend!) Kristen and Rob are the perfect Edward and Bella. They were captivating from start to finish. I sat back in my seat and listened to my whole theater erupt in laughs, gasps, sighs and jumps at all the right places. Granted most of us in there were young women, but the movie just plain rocked that way. It sucks you in and tells the story just right. Even my friend who hadn't read the books was just as enthralled as the majority of us fan girls.The humor was Twilight's greatest asset. The baseball game was amazing and the mirror fight scene was tense. I enjoyed the music, the non-overdone visual effects, the adherence to all major plot points and characters and the ending. The ending was pretty much the best. I walked out really salivating to see the next 3 on screen, just like that.If you give Twilight a shot, you shouldn't be disappointed. It's that good."
beckettwarner,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"Twilight is a comforting cult classic with mostly good actors in a very good adaptation of questionable source material. Hardwick brings her A game translating a cheesy book to the screen, and I belive intentionally makes it a b movie. The soundtrack is on point, the vampires don't have fangs, we made italiano, the setting is great.If you like gothic horrors you will be amused by this contemporary take. If you like vampire movies, you will be confused by their unique rules. If you like YA romances, this is entirely your jam. Is it trash? Absolutely, but it's my trash and it gets watched monthly! 🐀"
da_zeon,"Feb 1, 2009",6/10,"OK, so from what I know about this movie, people either love it or hate it. The truth, of course, is somewhere in-between. While the movie is not perfect, it is very good fun and delivers as long as you don't expect a masterpiece. So don't raise the bar of your expectations too high - this is NOT going to be an Oscar winning masterpiece and it is NOT going to enter the IMDb Top 250.The story is simple - Bella Swan is a common girl which falls in love with the vampire Edward Cullen. Cullen's family are ""vegetarians"" - they drink only animal blood and do not attack humans. Then, however, are the ""classic"" vampires that would not hesitate to do it, and Edward protects Bella from them.I guess those who hate the movie do not know what a bad movie really is. You can call a movie bad when you regret that you watched it and when you feel that you have lost two hours without any good reason. ""Twilight"" is not that kind of movie. It has a sense of direction and it is not just ""flowing around"" like other movies. Acting is pretty decent. Although I thought Kristen Stewart was an awful actress, Robert Pattinson (Ed Cullen) and Cam Gigandet (James, the villain vampire) excel in their roles. Although the story is not one of the most original ones, it does not bore people and if you have nothing to do, I would recommend seeing ""Twilight"".Oh, and by the way, for all the girls who adore ""Twilight"", I guess I get them. After all, Ed Cullen is good-looking, super-strong, super-fast, sensitive, who wouldn't like him?"
OneTiredMom,"Jul 31, 2009",1/10,"Kristen Stewart was beyond horrible.The role of Bella was totally mis-cast, and that ruined the entire movie! How can you miscast the main character? She's a lousy actress to say the least.She put no emotion into her role.She STUNK! Additionally, the director didn't not put enough thought into this movie.It was like he just tried to ""hurry up"" and get it into the theaters as quickly as possible.If he would have taken more time, made the movie a bit longer (only if he would have followed the book more closely), then, and maybe then, I would have given this movie a higher rating. But again, Kristen Stewart totally ruined Bella. Instead of bringing her to life. She KILLED HER COMPLETELY!"
shepatna,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"I absolutely love Twilight! I watch it every year, at least twice a year. It's my go-to when the weather begins to cool down, and it's time to pull out a hot drink, and loads of fluffy blankets! This movie improves my mood, and brings me back to good memories, while simultaneously making new ones!As my children have aged, I've also had the delight in sharing it with them! I made sure they read the books first, of course, but now they all understand my guilty pleasure.Did you know that vampires sparkle? Top quality graphic work, right there. I certainly couldn't have done that myself.Team Edward!"
onurish,"Dec 28, 2008",7/10,"Before I begin, let me just say that I haven't read the book, so I'm not some die-hard Twilight fan or anything. In fact I hadn't even heard of either the book or the movie until a couple of months ago when my cousin (who had been reading the entire series) showed me her books and talked to me about it. She even said that there was a movie for the first book that was going to be released in a couple of months time. I remained uninterested, and I still lacked the enthusiasm to actually want to watch this movie in the first place, despite all of the frenzy over it, particularly with my female friends who, at the moment, have gone absolutely gaga over the male lead, Robert Pattinson (who plays the role of Edward).It was only two days ago, when a good friend of mine who I hadn't seen since June (because I moved to another school), asked me if I wanted to go to the cinema with him to watch Twilight. There really wasn't anything else on that could have been better, so I just thought ""what the heck, might as well give it a shot"". And so I did.This friend of mine is not really the kind of person to be watching movies like Twilight. Indeed, he is more of an action/superhero film type person, and so I don't think he liked the film that much (at the end I noticed an iPod earphone in his ear - need I say more?). Even now I'm still quite surprised that he even suggested watching Twilight in the first place.I, on the other hand, consider myself more open to different film types, and I enjoy a little bit of almost everything, Twilight being no exception.The choice of actors was simply a job well done; all of them fit into their roles perfectly. Pattinson, with his amazing, masculine good looks and pale skin, fits perfectly into role of the ""both-warm-and-cold"" vampire that is Edward Cullens. What I mean by ""both-warm-and-cold"" is that despite his cold looks and temperaments, he is an extremely likable character and his somewhat hopeless romanticism takes over slightly without tarnishing his vampire image. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else who could suit Edward's role better than Pattinson. Needless to say, he also makes really good eye candy.The choice of Kristen Stewart as Bella is also very noteworthy, as she also manages to fit her role as a pale, very reserved young woman really well. Bravo to her too.Just - bravo to both of them. Never have I seen such chemistry in a film. They are just such an item, and it's easy to see how much in love the two characters are thanks to these two wonderful actors.I felt that the film was filmed really well, too. I particularly love how every second of the film in Forks (the main setting of the movie) looks so cold and grim, and it kind of adds to the whole bleakness of it all.All of this, however, does not mean that Twilight doesn't have it's flaws. In the first half of the movie, despite it starting of well, it really seemed to have dragged on quite a bit and it wasn't until the second half that things started to get really engaging and interesting, and even exciting. Unfortunately I still don't quite understand one or two elements of the plot as much as I would have wanted to, so obviously that's a major flaw too.On a more minor note, the special effects could have been a little better, particularly with the whole ""speedy vampire"" business, which looked somewhat unrealistic, but despite it being unrealistic in the first place anyway, the special FX people could have made it seem more real than it actually did.Nevertheless, the above criticisms do not change the fact that it is definitely a watchable movie. It's not perfect, and it definitely could have been, but I guess at least it's kind of gotten me interested in reading the book, now. After watching that film, now I want to read the book so that I can finally understand those things that I didn't. In a way, my criticism of that may be considered a bit of an irony, but it is still no excuse to make the plot incomprehensible. Like I said, the film could have been much better."
mrpobb,"Apr 3, 2009",3/10,"this movie is really stupid but not in an obvious way. They have a secret 'subtly'running for the first hour which if you haven't seen a T.V you might not guess. My advice is to watch any Heath Ledger movie cause it has a far better plot and cute guy. Enough saidThe thing about this is that it is not a funny comedy, an eventful action movie, an emotion filled drama or basically any type of genre. I, for one, was confused. It was obvious what was going to happen to a three year old. FYI I watched this with a three year old who thought this was far to unintelligent. Although it may confuse am.... no one.Can I saw to summarise that I was confused as to the point of this. The director laughed his ""you know what"" off all the way to the bank. This movie contained more stars less tanned than me and i'm a red headed Irish man.But in closing, this film is an amazement to any person who cannot tackle the complexity of George of the Jungle"

RCWjr,"Jan 2, 2009",7/10,"I can't remember the last time that I was literally one of 3 or 4 men in an otherwise packed theater. Tonight was just the case when my wife and I took in Twilight. My interest had been peaked by a co-worker who is female and a big Twilight fan. My wife has not read the books (nor I) but did receive the first 2 for Christmas. We wanted to check out the movie and see what all the hoopla was all about. We were not disappointed.I really enjoyed this movie. It does play like an episode straight out of any female focused romance story that is currently playing on TV. But there is a maturity about the film that brings it up a notch. It is full on love story stuff, but being a guy who isn't afraid to embrace the chick-flick side, I was pulled into the story, even though I know basically the outcome of the whole 4 book set. Catherine Hardwicke spun a very nice tale, it is shame she will not be back for New Moon. I thought all of the acting was top notch, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson the obvious standouts. But it was the supporting characters; Edward's family, Bella's friends and family, that really helped with the enjoyment of the film.I had heard reports of laugh inducing dialog, never caught any of that. With any story that has a target audience that is in their teen years, one must expect earnest and often overly dramatic dialog and moments. It never goes into the day-time soap variety.There was a lot of online snipping from mucho-macho fanboys that mocked the film (without having read the books) and called in a Covenant clone. Too bad they won't let their geek cred take a hit and actually go see this film before bashing it. Not anything that will change cinema forever, but a very different and entertaining take on the vampire genre. The thing I enjoyed the most was the return of romance to the vampire tale. Recent films have taken a more action approach to the vampire tale. I can't wait for New Moon."
mrdeadhead7,"Apr 6, 2009",1/10,"I respect that some people are trying to take this movie for what it is, and respect this tween-horror-vampire-romance-coming-of-age-angsty-drama slop-fest.But I can't. This movie gives up all character development, plot development, and pacing for about 2 hours of staring into the camera with a perplexed yet upset look on a face, the most fairy-rific game of baseball ever, and about 15 seconds of what was supposed to be a Climactic Battle between good and evil, humanity and monstrosity, base instinct and morality.On top of all that, it also goes and takes they Vampire mythos, rapes it behind a Hot Topic, throws it some change and tells it to get itself cleaned up, then hops in its Volvo and guns it back to Sillytown. A vampire with no weaknesses is not a vampire, it's a blood-sucking-super-powered demigod. And what would a demigod that has no weaknesses and has apparently been around for centuries (if not millennia) do with their great power? Apparently, move to Washington State, start a family and make sure your kids do well in high school. Vampires need to burst into flame in the daylight, it keeps them in check, sparking gold is not a bad thing. All that would really happen is that a vampire would pretend to be a male stripper and then kill everyone.And don't tell me ""oh you can rip them apart and burn them!"" because no human can catch, rip apart, and burn a vampire without about 50 other humans getting killed, at which point another vampire shows up and kills the rest.The plot is illogical, dripping with teenage drama (even though you'd think that at about 100 years old Edward would get over it by now), and all classic storytelling techniques have been thrown out for what sounds like a myspace blog from a Indiana goth teenage girl with psoriasis and a nub that is technically an extra pinky toe.By the way, this movie would have gotten a better rating if they just had the damn Indians turn into werewolves and kick some ass."
firefly-27,"Jan 19, 2009",1/10,"I read the book and was so excited to see this movie, but was utterly disappointed. With in the first ten minutes I wanted to get up and leave. The special effects were cheesy, the running scenes were not what I would have expected to see, and seemed more cheesy than unreal.The characters never seemed to be natural they all seemed like they were being forced to say what they were saying and just awkward to watch. Edward looked constipated through out the whole film and it was just uncomfortable to watch. It did follow the book's storyline very well with some parts left out as usual, but the worst acting ever! I would not recommend seeing this movie, read the book instead."
cordellm1,"Jun 9, 2022",7/10,"I read a review saying Twilight is uniquely atmospheric, and I cannot find a better way to describe why it's actually pretty fine. Nostalgia may play a part in this."

My friend and I when we are having a bad day or a hard week will binge watch the entire series and feel a thousand times better. The movie might have some flaws but that makes it all the more better. Bella is suppose to be that way, that's who she is. We all are not perfect. I think her character is way more relatable than most other movies who are ""perfect"". Read the books and you will love the series that much more. It is quirky and shows so much love at the same time. Things don't always go to plan. It's showing one persons life story, yes there are red flags but we all have been in relationships like that... Her and Edward grow together and make each other better for it. He does love her and the more they are together the better he will love her. This movie does not deserve the hate it is getting. Life is strange, let it go."
brooke-98054,"Oct 24, 2020",10/10,"I love Twilight and the whole saga. I'm not ashamed of it because I personally think they are some of the best films. Every scene is captured beautifully and the romance is compelling. The story flows naturally and made me excited the whole way through. The acting definitely improves, but for what we're given, it's quite good. And I got some laughs out of it.
Overall, I love this movie and it's definitely worth your time."
alvinvigil,"Nov 19, 2008",7/10,"About a year ago I was already reading and hearing about a new film, something called Twilight, which was going to hit in the fall of 2008. Well, the buzz is bigger than ever and the film finally opens this Friday. Gathering from earlier preview screenings, this film is going to be big. Based on the very popular books by Stephanie Meyer (there are 17 million books in print), Twilight is a unique vampire movie about a girl, Bella (Kristen Stewart) who moves in with her estranged father (Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington. Having always been different, she meets an even more mysterious guy, Edward (Robert Pattinson), who at first is disgusted by her (she's human, he is not) but then takes a liking to her. He's unlike any boy she's ever met and finds that Romeo and Juliet connection. Edward's family is unique; they're all vampires but don't feed on human blood, as a matter of fact, they don't eat at all. They live comfortably in a ""green house"" somewhere in the forest. His dad (Peter Facinelli, Jenny Garth's husband) is a doctor at the local hospital and they have gobs of cash (the books reveal how well off they are, but in the film, there's no explanation). A clan of new vampires are passing through and they threaten the little Pacific Northwest town feeding on the small population, but one in the group James (Cam Gigandet), is out to get the young Bella.This modern day love story is the strangest vampire movie I've ever seen. It's sort of a cross between The Lost Boys and Gossip Girl, which if you think about it, is a pretty enticing combination. I have to admit, having not read any of the books in this four-part series, I didn't know what I was in for. I knew it was about vampire teens in some Washington coastal town and that's about it, but I was intrigued from the start. The young cast look like your every day teen, and the vampire cast are as pale as Casper the Ghost. Some move swiftly, some sprint up trees and some can see into the future, fast-drawing her visuals on paper. It's all quite impressive. The story primarily belongs to Bella and Edward. The teen vampire hasn't aged in 90 years and finally finds someone who isn't afraid of him. Unfortunately for him, she's mortal. She's definitely not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and he fights off the temptation of human blood. I'd say he's sort of like an addict that keeps fighting his urges. See... I told you, it's unlike any other vampire movie I've seen. Twilight is certainly no Interview With A Vampire (my favorite vampire movie) or Bram Stoker's Dracula (my other favorite) but it certainly stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire; it's passionate, exciting, intense and the Northwest locations are beautiful, you just want to drive there for a weekend get-away."
Kykuit,"Jul 31, 2009",1/10,"So, so very bad. Robert Pattinson, the male lead, is made-up like the Avon Lady. Nikki Reed looks like one of the black guys in White Chicks and Kristen Stewart was as wooden and flat as a living human being can possibly be. The special effects are not equal to 50's TV and the script was painful to hear. Perhaps that is why the actors performed on something equal to middle-school level.The sooner this tasteless little flick fades away, the better.I assume Summit is rushing to complete the rest of the movies before the fan base grows up and develops some sense of taste.Oh well, you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear."
k_beth91,"Mar 31, 2009",N/A,"First of all I'd like to say that not many movies ever accomplish the difficult task of doing their books justice, but this movie basically made the books look ridiculously lame and cheesy. Anyone who watched the movie first hoping for some insight to the books will NOT want to read the books afterwards because the love story seems so unrealistic..while the reason the books are so popular is because they SEEM like the love between Edward and Bella could actually happen in real life! Until the baseball scene, there was really no action, and the movie just kind of dragged along. Once the ""bad"" vampires came into play, things finally started to get interesting. I think they should've included more action like this throughout the entire movie to keep viewers attention."

abogadosolis,"Apr 9, 2009",1/10,"last night finally rented the DVD, expecting a chick flick, some action, good music and a sense of fantasy and adventure. what I got back? two hours of lame acting, poor direction, no action, stupid phrases. did I mention the lame acting? there's no development, you cannot care for the characters. I laughed out loud the first time I saw the vampire youngsters in the school. no one can go walking through life with that amount of powder in their face!!! you can tell a mile away they're blood suckers. and all that Stewart and Pattinson's characters do is look into each other eyes, sigh, talk nonsense. For the first time in years i used the fast forward button in the remote. seriously!!! It is a product made for girls up to 14 years old. There's no romanticism here, no fantasy, no sense of epic love. It's more an infatuation, a whim, opposites attract with no possibility of a future based in something else than the pale look of both of the main characters. If you're expecting something of a ""Harry Potter meets Vampires"" movie, you WILL be disappointed. wait until it's on HBO and save you money. Please do!"
marquitamcintire,"Nov 12, 2022",10/10,"This is literally one of the best movies to ever exist. And I say one of, because the other best movies is the rest of the saga! There is no love like Bella and Edwards, expect for maybe Bella and Jacobs. This film goes beyond all expectations with it excellent blue filter settings, bag of hard boiled egg props, and a script that will keep my book of pick up lines full.I do wish they didn't leave out Bella's ankle length khaki skirt that she wore in the book to meet the Cullens. That was a massive injustice to Smeyers. But I guess it's also a plus that Regurgitate isn't in this one. She scares me."
Pico_66,"Dec 7, 2008",6/10,"This film was awful. A non event and I would not recommend watching it. It was little more than a disjointed effort leading nowhere with the acting so poor I had to laugh. The scenes between the protagonists were awkward, unconvincing and lamentable. No one character was fully developed. There was much that was alluded to but never fully explored. How much was the budget? The problem here was directorial not financial. Some movies need polishing up; this one needs polishing off! I watched hoping it would get better - like some poor B movie. What I was left with was mild irritation, like a hangover after drinking bad wine. I can't believe I sat through this. I was so irritated at one point by the acting I almost walked out. I'm sorry this review is scathing but there was little to praise. I had little by way of expectation. I read fleetingly, in the tabloids, that it was a vampire movie. Okay, so it was a film aimed at the teenage market - but honestly, are teenagers, these days, so unsophisticated and banal? I suspect many will vote with their feet. I've heard nothing but praise for the book. I haven't read it. Was it meant to be a romantic movie? If that was the case then it was lost on me. The theme floundered like a damp squid. This was really a wasted opportunity. Give me a Hammer Horror movie any day. Movies starring the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are in a different league. Low budget but with kudos. These actors knew their trade and were proud of it. Not sure which genre I would place ""Twilight"" in, but perhaps the bin would be more appropriate. I remember vividly watching a stellar performance from a stunning Michelle Pfeiffer and the inimitable Jack Nicholson jousting with the irrepressible James Spader in the 1994 movie, ""Wolf"". Now that film was truly a joy to watch. I was moved to tears. The story and suspense had your gripped from the start. It was a roller coaster ride with superlative performances. The film evoked emotion. Memorable? Definitely! I predict that ""Twilight"" (2008), will fade with day break and be a distant memory."
thalassafischer,"Oct 22, 2023",3/10,"I never in the world would have sat still for this cinematic tragedy unless I had been bribed with a group viewing that featured pumpkin carving and cake. It was fun to make constant commentary as an ostensibly 100 year old vampire seduces a high school girl. The lack of subtlety in the writing borders on the insane due to the fact that Edward is inwardly an old man stalking 17 year old Bella, casually breaking into her room, and endangering her life by introducing her to his ""friends"" and family. Highlights include permissive parenting that has devolved into child neglect as both mother and father of a teenager never once question how her strange, new boyfriend ended up along with her in the hospital suffering a badly broken leg and massive blood loss. The Mormon church has some explaining to do.3 stars for Pacific Northwest tall trees and inexplicably blue atmosphere."
dsh-86364,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"I have watched this movie upwards of 75 times in my life and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. This movie carries memories of friendship, sleepovers, and midnight viewings in home made t-shirts. There is merit to a story when it captures so many people's hearts- and I see Twilight as that story. The books that inspired this film brought the love of reading into the lives of many young girls and the movies only furthered the excitement. Edward and Bellas romance may be flawed, but the thorough enjoyment I get watching this movie has never worn off even all these years later. If you are a lover of vampires and have never seen this movie I reccomend it. And to those who have seen it and love it, may we continue blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever <3."

When a truck is going to run over Bella, Edward uses an extraordinary force to save her. The intrigued Belle presses Edward to disclose his secret and he finally tells that his family and he are vegetarian vampires that drink animal blood only. Meanwhile three evil vampires are attacking the locals and Edward and his family protect Bella from the malign vampire hunter James (Cam Gigandet).""Twilight"" is an entertaining teen romance and I believe that the bad reviews are from people that read the book (I have not read the novel, but I know that adaptations of best-sellers are usually disappointing) or that are misguided expecting to see a horror movie of vampires. However, the vampire story is a romance like, for example, the excellent version of ""Dracula"" of Francis Ford Coppola also is. The different story and the acting are not outstanding but also not as bad as indicated in many reviews. Actually I liked this movie very much. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Crepúsculo"" (""Twilight"")"
Nelicquele_Eyzaathe,"Apr 6, 2009",1/10,"As a fan of the series I assumed it would at least SLIGHTY resemble the book.. I guess I was wrong..Half of what when done was inaccurate and the other half was rushed.. They took events that were supposed to ""take place"" over the course of 6/7 months and packed then into a 2 hr movie that played out like it was a week. Making the movie even more gag worthy.This was a great concept (in theory) but would have been SOOOOO much better as a TV show. 1 book per season. AND WHO CAST THIS GARBAGE!!!..So i don't know what else to say other than I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!~ Disappointed in CT"
Corkles_the_Clown,"Apr 8, 2009",1/10,"If you really wanna scare rogue nations, plunk a giant screen down in their country from the sky and play this movie! I pride myself on being a fairly big fan of cinema and have NEVER fallen asleep during a movie....until I saw this flick! Goofy metro sexual hair do's, a gang of pale faced uber vamp teeny clones....Now another problem. These vamp kids are supposed to soooo old..How in the heck are they able to attend school for all these years and no one realize they haven't graduated??!! I can't believe people fell for this. If you are going to have a brooding vampire movie, have them brood for a halfway decent reason. Twilight fails because the story forces itself along. Christopher Lee could carry a vampire because he was able to stir feelings and emotions of viewers. This movie doesn't because the talent lacks in that department....Sorely!!...But this is more due to trend riding than anything else. I think we are in overdose of the ""male vampire falls in love with teeny bopper"" story line right now."
CatfishOpinions,"May 18, 2020",7/10,"Listen. I KNOW it's hip to hate twilight. But come on. If you want some good ol' low effort fanfiction romance, this movie series is AMAZING. and you know what? This movie is actually not bad! The romance is pretty good, the music is awesome, the setting and the color and aesthetic are all really nice, and Charlie is a sweetie.I would love to say that I ironically like this movie, but the irony comes from the fact that I genuinely enjoy it. So you know what? No irony here! I like Twilight, and I'm not afraid to say it anymore!(Team Jacob, btw. fight me.)"
jon-larsen,"Apr 24, 2010",1/10,"This movie is simply awful! I don't hate it because it's a chick flick. I hate it because the acting was so awful, i just wanted to scream at the television!The story was so incredibly bad!There is no character's development, and the characters are so bad!This movie is a disgrace for vampires!Are vampires vegetarian? Do vampires go out while it's sun outside? Are they supposed to sparkle? Are vampires supposed to be driving and wearing sunglasses? No, they're are not supposed to drive and vampires do not wear sunglasses, because they're not supposed to be outside on a sunny day! Do vampires eat animal blood instead of human blood? And do they have souls? NO!!I gave this movie 1/10 because I enjoyed the cinematography!This movie is a great example of a bad movie!"
reneemadesbiens-29727,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"Seriously who wouldn't love this classic love story? A true masterpiece. The blue filter just pulls the entire movie together and gives it the air of mystery that really keeps you on your toes throughout the entire film. If you're looking for a brooding, mysterious bad boy, then look no further than here. Edward Cullen is every 16 year old emo girls dream. This movie made me start wearing knee high converse unironically and wear an excessive amount of eyeliner daily. This should be considered a cult classic at this point considering how many people continue to watch the entire series regularly and know it word for word."
deyoung-20959,"Mar 12, 2022",7/10,God I love this movie.. it's one of those it's so bad it's good but it also holds a special place in my heart. The 12 year old in me still loves this story even though I know how garbage it is. The bad writing and awkward acting is just the cherry on top.. I love it.
chocolatevibe,"Nov 22, 2008",6/10,"I admit, I am not a fan of Twilight. I tried the books, thought they were boring, and forgot about them. I don't hate it, but I can't say I'm a fan. Somehow, though, I ended up going to the midnight showing with a group of friends, all of whom were fanatical Twihards.This movie was extremely entertaining to me, but for all the wrong reasons. I found myself laughing at the cheesy, often poorly-delivered lines, Rob's stony, creepy expression, which he retained throughout pretty much every scene, and the headache inducing, cheap special effects. I wasn't the only one; there was plenty of nervous, sometimes incredulous laughter from almost everyone there once the screams died down. In several scenes, it seemed almost as if the director was parodying the book, rather than trying to make a serious movie.Now don't get me wrong, this movie was not terrible. I liked the setting, it was pretty beautiful, and Bella's father's acting seemed quite believable. The plot also sped along a bit faster than the book did, making it less boring to me. However, Bella's actor seemed wooden, and Robert Pattinson seemed awkward and uncomfortable at times. Sure, he's pretty to look at, but he didn't convey emotions very well and dropped lines in a disinterested, bland way. After a while the movie began to get extremely dull and repetitive to the point where I felt like tearing my hair out.I liked how they fleshed out some of the lesser-known characters and gave them more personalities, and I loved Jacob's actor. The lack of climax was disappointing, and I found myself getting very annoyed with Bella quickly.Even so, most Twilight fans will probably enjoy it, but people new to the story (especially adults) will probably be confused (my mom was) and left with an empty feeling. I didn't feel as though I was being tortured by watching it, but besides all the unintentionally comedic parts it didn't entertain me that much."
Heath618,"Dec 16, 2008",1/10,"Thankfully I didn't bring my husband with me when I saw this movie. I went by myself and I was STILL embarrassed by its sappy/corny screen writing. The movie doesn't catch the essence of the books at all. The effects were horrible. The ""blurs"" when the vampires were moving uber-fast looked like a sad mistake from a bad 1970s film, and the wire-work when Edward and Bella are leaping from Edward's room to a tree looks like NOTHING like a leap; they clumsily swing back and forth. yuck. Rob's American accent is generally pretty unbelievable--unless Edward is supposed to have a speech impediment. Some of the acting in the movie was pretty good--Charlie, Rosalie, and a few others, for instance. Most of the acting was Horrible--and here I'm mainly talking about the two MAIN characters. Not believable at ALL. Kristen Stewart is WAY too serious, and she doesn't let you into her head at all----which is a huge part of the books, I might add. It's like she's just looking for good camera angles the whole movie through. Rob Pattinson makes vampirism seem really boring. He doesn't do well playing a perfect character. In interviews he even says that Kristen Stewart is intimidating in real life and probably looks like the real vampire in the movie, because she made him nervous and clumsy....THAT's vampire-like! Bad directing. Does Catherine Hardwicke hate the light side of human nature, or what? It seems like most of the actors in all the movies she's ever directed hardly smile at all. nice going. i won't be seeing this movie again. Let's just hope I can get this out of my head by the time I read the series over again. Don't waste your time."
dpuczek,"Apr 18, 2009",N/A,"I don't even know where to start...Never read the book but one should be able to watch any movie today (if the movie is worth its weight) without having to do so - heck, Lord of the Rings pulled it off.The casting in this movie was dead awful - I haven't see this many cardboard actors since The Phantom Menace. The direction was equally bad - slow-moving and trying to be all artsy - and the hype centered around this movie is a crime that should not go unpunished. The special effects were laughable as no one's done the ""fast-running/fast-climbing"" thing convincing enough yet. With so much to work with material-wise, it's a shame that people can still muck things up like this. Any one with any creative vision would be able to do more with a cardboard box and some tape.I sat through this 2-hour crap-fest to please the wife, who was not pleased herself with the translation from book to screen. Ashame that they wouldn't give roles like these out to a more deserving and talented set of young actors - whoever picked these two - yikes! Just about everyone involved in this cast was terrible.At least there are some laughable moments in this film - though I don't think they were suppose to be laughable.Any Michael Dudikoff/Chuck Norris/Treat Williams flick has more heart than Twilight."

enaye,"Aug 1, 2021",6/10,"Don't let the ratings fool you, I'm not a fan of the twilight series but its an okay decent film to watch on a date night. It's like a 6-7/10 typa movie."
kaysiepolad,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"Honestly, this movie is bad when you think of it as a rom-com. But change your mindset to a comedy? It's actually one of the best movies ever. An amazing movie with great actors and actresses. Try the comedy trick next time you're watching. As the preview states, Bella and Edward are your main characters. You've got some side characters like Jacob, Jessica, Charlie Swan the sheriff, and the worm featured in a field trip. If this doesn't sound like a good time, I'm not sure what to tell you. Give it an honest and willing try when you are cuddling up with a blanket and have a bowl of popcorn in front of you."
excalibur212,"Apr 7, 2009",1/10,"I could tell from the trailer this movie was trash, but out of curiosity and boredom/insomnia i gave it a download (would never pay a penny to watch this). I couldn't even make it halfway through without turning it off. The storytelling was like reading a children's book: everything told in linear fashion, and then spelled out with ""flashcards"" two seconds later in case anyone was still too dense to understand (e.g. say wolf, then show a picture of a wolf on the screen...show a book she wants, then two scenes later show her in the library...gee, thanks, i wouldn't have understood without the spoon-feeding). I think this movie was meant for 12 year olds or people of very low intelligence. They should show movies like this to film students and do play by plays, ""OK, here's how NOT to shoot a scene/edit a movie...."" How do studios actually give people with no talent money to make crap movies like this??? Do yourself a favor: Go see ""Let The Right One In"" instead. That is, if you have an IQ over 80."
Psycho_sano,"Nov 8, 2024",7/10,"This movie, despite its polarizing reception, undeniably crafted a deeply atmospheric experience. For all the criticisms thrown its way, *Twilight* has an allure that, even years later, still resonates, especially when you examine the elements that truly make it stand out: the cinematography, the soundtrack, and the magnetic performances of its leads.First, the cinematography by Elliot Davis. He managed to turn the rainy, misty town of Forks, Washington, into a character of its own. The film is drenched in blue and grey tones, casting a moody, almost ethereal veil over the world of humans and vampires alike. It's a choice that subtly enhances the supernatural elements without needing to rely on flashy effects. The forest scenes, where towering evergreens are shrouded in fog, feel both vast and intimate, almost as if the forest is keeping secrets. And that iconic ""meadow scene,"" with sunlight dappling through leaves, evokes a surreal beauty-it's the stuff of fantasy, yet grounded enough to keep the romance believable.The soundtrack, too, is an undeniable triumph. With artists like Muse and Linkin Park setting the tone, and Carter Burwell's delicate, haunting score weaving in and out, the music captures the story's intensity and the raw magnetism between Bella and Edward. ""Bella's Lullaby,"" composed by Burwell, is a soft, yearning melody that perfectly underscores the sense of dangerous romance. And let's be real-Muse's ""Supermassive Black Hole"" playing during the infamous baseball scene? It's unforgettable, capturing the adrenaline and strangeness of vampires trying to blend in. The soundtrack elevates the story, not just as background noise but as an essential emotional force.And then, of course, the performances. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson gave us a fresh kind of chemistry. Stewart's Bella Swan is reserved, awkward, but refreshingly real-a far cry from the typical leading lady of fantasy romances. She brings an earnestness to Bella, grounding her emotions in a way that makes the unbelievable feel palpable. Pattinson, as Edward Cullen, brings a blend of brooding allure and vulnerability, capturing the pain of a vampire eternally suspended between life and death. He plays Edward with a haunted intensity, as if every word is both a confession and a warning. Together, they make the romance feel electric yet restrained, an intimate dance of attraction held in check by Edward's fear of his own predatory nature.In the end, *Twilight* is a film that holds nothing back in its commitment to mood, music, and a romance that, while unconventional, is as entrancing as it is uneasy. It's unapologetically itself, embracing its own brand of fantasy. And love it or hate it, you can't deny it achieved something rare: it became an iconic piece of pop culture, casting a spell that viewers have yet to shake off."
nmellark,"Nov 11, 2022",10/10,"This movie got me through my childhood; it may not be the best overall but it's the perfect movie to me. I wish I could experience seeing it for the first time all over again and the sheer hold it had over me in my middle school days. Even to this day, this whole saga means a lot to me and the first movie being my favorite.Word of advice, if you want to like this movie don't let anyone stop you just because it's 'Twilight' and 'its bad' because it's not actually THAT bad for it's time. Honestly wish we could dip our toes back into the saga and get a remakes that we deserve, but until then I'll continue to love the movie as is.🐀"
begleybeth,"Oct 30, 2024",7/10,"This is exactly what it's supposed to be, a teenage love drama. It has atmosphere, story and great music.Even years later I find it's still a great movie to pop on from one of the various streaming sights, easy watching and filmed well enough that it hasn't really aged too much considering the age of the movie now.The love story itself is also quite intoxicating and leaves you wishing that you had had that in your younger years.Now the music.....I find the music great in the full series of films and happily play the playlist on Spotify.The series of films does justice to the books and should be watched even if you don't like the romance side."
gab2012,"Nov 22, 2022",10/10,"I originally watched this and read the books when I was like 12/13 years old. I'm revisiting now at age 25. I thought I would not be into it still, but I was wrong. This series is just so entertaining to me. I think the movie missed a lot of nuance that was present in the book, as movies often do (them getting to know each other, tension, info about the characters that is important to who they are, etc). I also felt that Edward & Bella are much more likable characters in the book. Bella is a genuinely good person, but I think in the movie she comes across mediocre. Edward feels like less of a creep in the books too. Lol. Regardless, I find this movie hilarious and fun."
cschaka,"Sep 13, 2020",7/10,"VERY GOOD ! Heart-warming, sweet, romantic, super ! And very good choices for casting ! I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles !
And definitely not to forget: THE MUSIC in this film IS AMAZING !!!And now to so many of the people who wrote negative reviews for this film: people, just enjoy a sweet, romantic movie without ""looking in the horse's mouth"" !! I read some of your negative reviews and actually your reviews are poorer than the poorest elements of the film..So my message to Kirstin Stewart: girl, don't listen to the haters, you did well in this movie and I liked it !
Same to Robert Pattinson: well done, bro, you did well in this movie and I liked it !"
wot_106,"Sep 1, 2010",2/10,"As an avid fantasy reader, I have not delved the vampire depths, and I find the current fad of vampires as sex objects disgusting.I had planed to never watch this movie, but when I found that some of the former MST3K crowd (Mike, Bill, and Kevin) made their own ""commentary"" for it (rifftrax.com), I just couldn't resist.To sum up the plot in one word: AngstTo sum up the event that is the movie(in sotto voce): Line!So if I were to rate this as an MST3K film it would be about a 8 or 9. The acting on the part of the main characters was poor throughout, and the pacing was terrible. The only clue that time had gone by was in the dialog (I swear the clothes rarely changed!), and only in passing. Also, Bella's high school seems to only consist of parking lot, cafeteria and Biology. Ha!"
usm2203,"Jan 24, 2010",1/10,"MY pure opinion in this movie, which I'll have to admit, I did not see willingly.If there's one thing I can't stand about a movie, it's a huge hype up. 10 million screaming morons...morning, noon, and night...I LOVE EDWARD, I LOVE EDWARD, I LOVE EDWARD. This movie...THIS MOVIE...WAS ANOTHER HYPE UP FOR CRAP!!! The sauntering mentally disable actress, the mascera caked MEN(???), the extreme homo-eroticism between vampires, the dialogue back in the forth that went in circles over and over and over.I cracked open the book after the theater. Waste of money. Boring.That's the extent of the movie. Boring. Dull. Lacking anything particularly interesting."
Chrysanthepop,"Sep 14, 2013",N/A,"I've been avoiding 'Twilight' for years and was only open to watching it if it was on a had-to basis. And so, as that basis has presented itself, I watched it. After the immense popularity of the novels, particularly among the young crowd, a Hollywood movie seems to be the next step in further cashing in on the popularity these days. Famous examples include the Harry Potter films and 'The Da Vinci Code'.Cheesy and corny as it is, there are some unintentionally funny moments. The writing, directing, visuals and acting are quite poor. The special effects are sometimes so bad that it looks like a B-Movie.Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart became one of the most liked on- screen couple. 'Twilight' further made Stewart's lack of expression popular which may have overshadowed some of her good work (yes she can act at least sometimes as proved in 'Welcome to the Rileys' and even 'In The Land Of Women'). Pattinson does a passable job here. Most of the rest of the actors just follow formula. Special mention ought to be given to the lousy fight sequences.Overall, it's quite a silly film even dreadful at times but mostly (inadvertently) funny."
DaytonMetroSoccer,"Jan 9, 2009",7/10,"There were flaws, of course there were flaws, the book is over 500 pages and most scripts in this type of font are only about 60-180. That means the writers can not adapt everything to make all the fans happy with the film. The directing was amazing and the effects were around the B area, but the film itself is good. We all know that vampires don't exist, but it's a fiction. I really truly did not want to see this. But I was forced in and when the first ten minutes started, I was gripping the edge of my seat for the rest. It was very riveting and enjoyable, I'm sure most people will enjoy it and love it. I'm on book three and can not wait for the New Moon movie."
jackstarr777,"Jul 25, 2011",1/10,"How could a film as horribly awful as this be so popular? There are so many bad things about it, I don't even know where to begin. It's not just because it's a girl's film, or it's about romance. It's just so... dull, and plot less, and just plain bad.There is hardly any story to it. It just seems like a huge mass of pointless, uninteresting characters with awful acting. It's just so hard to get.Avoid this film at all costs. Honestly, it is very, very bad... don't even give it a try.1/10. Actually, 0/10. It's so bad, it goes off the scale."
tempestspirit,"Nov 12, 2022",10/10,"There is plenty to mock in this movie but also so much to love. The cinematography and soundtrack create the perfect mood to rekindle all the teen angst you thought you'd outgrown. It's okay to go back to that well now and again. Draw up the bucket and take a sip! Go with the story and have fun. You can laugh at the poor acting and script, and nonetheless be entertained by the plot and the romance and those lines that beg to be said aloud later and out of context. As for problematic themes, they are there and inherited from the source material (e.g. Unhealthy romantic relationship dynamics and whitewashing/shallow engagement with indigenous cultures, to name just a couple). There are also positive and empowering elements, namely the centering of the female gaze and privileging of a girl's experience (and the diverse, evolving fandom that bloomed from this franchise). Folks will still be discovering and loving this film decades from now, I'm sure."
muamba_eats_toast,"Mar 19, 2020",7/10,Growing up I always refused to watch this like a lot of the guys of school age but gave it a chance during these times of quarantine and have to say I actually did enjoy it!

bkmcdermott,"May 26, 2009",1/10,"I first saw Twilight with a friend on opening night. I had never read the books nor heard anything about it, so I went in with a clean slate. I found myself laughing at inappropriate times (such as when the film-makers tried to use a blue filter to mask the fact that the actors were standing in direct sunlight) and whenever Kristen Stewart went into one of her spazy-blinky episodes. Knowing the movies had such a following with the books, I promptly went home and read the entire series and went to see the movie again. I now own the DVD as something to put me to sleep.As someone who works in television I am frustrated that such a horrible piece of garbage made it to the big screen. The acting was sub-par (though I rather enjoyed Billy Burke's performance), the special effects were atrocious, and the script belonged on a low-budget day-time soap NOT a big Hollywood production (I continuously had to ask my friend, who had read the books, what the heck was going on and I'm not giving anything away when I say that the love story was nonexistent).So, if you want to veg-out for two hours as you stare at a screen of over-glamorized teen life and drama with absolutely no build-up, Twilight is the movie for you."
megggymag,"Jun 26, 2011",2/10,"Where should I start? With the story itself? With the actors? With the director? Anyway, I will definitely have some negative words from the people who like this movie but every one of us have different tastes, right? :) So I had seen the movie before I read the book so I had no (NO!) expectations. But come on how can you give the main role to someone who can just blink and shake her head all the time?!?! Then came the second disappointment. Robert. He did not act like he was suffering from the pain he was going through but really looked like he had to pee so hard... he should have been something like ""Adonis"" but do not go deeper into the look, I may have a quite twisted imagination of Adonis :))) When I read the book I realized that the actors are the smallest problem with the movie. Why oh why did they write over almost all the scenes??? The best parts had been simply cut out - they wanted to write drama or what? They should have kept the easy jokes and chatting in order to avoid choking the story into boredom...those could show the real side of Bella - a lovably woeful, inexperienced teenager girl instead of a depressive loser. The only thing I can give a 2 is because of the actors chosen for Alice and Charlie - I really appreciate them! Okok, Emmett is also fine :) All in all, if I could start it again, I would definitely not waste my time for the movie but reading the book over and over again (like I do it every day :)). I would rate it with 10 points but not the movie."
rayrodgpa,"Oct 15, 2011",N/A,"""Twilight"" has to be one of the worst films that I have ever seen in my life! It has some of the worst acting that has ever been captured on film, not a single one of these characters are likable in anyway, the antagonists were lame, same as the protagonists, the movie seemed to never end, it was just stupid. I've been a vampire enthusiast for a long time, I love vampire productions(Nosferatu, Interview with a vampire, Lost Boys, and above all, Buffy the vampire Slayer(the best show ever). So it is not that I dislike the vampire genre, it's just that this is extremely stupid. I really don't see how anyone could like this movie, or it's painful to watch sequels. I hope this review was helpful and convinced you not to waste 2 hours of your life that you will never get back. Thanks."

pokemon_trainer_lucas,"Jun 23, 2019",7/10,"This film is definitely aimed at teens. If you're not a teen, you probably will think it's lame and fingers-down-your-throat bad. I was 12 when I first watched this, and I loved it to bits, I would have given it 11/10 stars at that age! But now, I'd give it a lot less. But, to give an accurate review, I thought I'd better put a rating that was in the middle ground between my two opinions.The acting in the film is mediocre. Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think ""that was actually convincing acting!"" but at others you kind of cringe and think ""oh that was baaad!"" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!The script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers."

The amount of hate from some people is annoying. If your not into this kind of movie fine, but your judgement is useless to those who like these movies."
bkoganbing,"Jan 1, 2010",7/10,"When young Robert Pattinson enters the life of Kirsten Stewart he was sure like any other young man she was likely to meet in her small town in the Pacific Northwest. He was unlike anyone she was likely to meet just about anywhere.Pattinson plays Edward Cullen of the Cullen clan of vampires. And Stewart's character of Belle Swan and Edward Cullen have become cult heroes for this younger generation. Needless to say both older Swans and Cullens aren't crazy about these two kids going out. Still as another popular film of a decade ago remarked, somehow these two complete each other.This film like the Harry Potter series has inspired a bunch of sequels made and in the planning stage from the novels which are bestsellers among current teens. Pattinson and Stewart are an attractive pair of young people and vampire or not, I sure see what they see in each other. More importantly they do communicate love to each other and to the audience.The Twilight series is going to be quite a money maker for a long time to come."
elly43,"May 13, 2010",2/10,"I read all the books in this saga and I found them fantastic. The plot is engaging and exciting, but when I saw the film it was a real disappointment. From my point of view, the inability of acting of some actors has made this movie less special. There is absolutely nothing of the magic contained in the book and I am personally disappointed by this. Whilst I do not criticize the writer Stephenie Meyer, because her books are special and are the most beautiful I have ever read, it should have been better not to make the movie because it does not transmit the same emotions you get from reading the book . My vote is two for the reasons I listed."
jdpate,"Nov 21, 2008",6/10,"I had just finished reading Twilight yesterday and was prepared to go to the midnight premier with high hopes of criticizing the movie based on the book. All-in-all, it wasn't a horrible movie, however, there were some small flaws that I found quite inaccurate.First off, Edward seemed more awkward than graceful. In almost every scene, his words flowed almost hesitantly from his mouth. The book describes his dialogue as ""silky,"" ""velvet"" and ""warm honey."" Also I had imagined him to be more confident than he appeared in the movie.Another book-to-film ""mishap"" that irritated me was the speediness of Edward and Hella's relationship. In the book, it seems to build up and Edward is EXTREMELY cautious and reluctant to even touch Bella. The film completely overlooked this, considering the first day Edward and Bella were together, Edward threw his arm around her as if he had no problem controlling his thirst.The final aspect that irritated me was the ""meadow scene."" This scene was absolutely atrocious! I'm not going to spoil anything, however, I think Twilight could have used some nice special effects for this scene.This is not a must-see, but it was still worth my $9.50"

""Let the right one in"" dares to take the plot, characters and scenes in direction Twilight does not even dare to peek at.I know I am not in the target age group for this movie but i still enjoyed the books and was hoping that Hollywood would not ruin it totally - but alas. No ""New Moon"" for me, thats for sure...Do yourself a favor in the video rental store, walk right past this one.Next."
cligutan,"Nov 19, 2008",9/10,"Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helps understand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I've seen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. But hey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wide age range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job and should make New Moon."
davispittman,"Mar 11, 2015",7/10,"I think this extremely popular book adaption film, Twilight, was a pretty enjoyable film to watch. Hate me if you want to, but I don't care, I can't lie, I enjoyed the film while I was watching it! Action sequences, a romance, and blood sucking vampires! Now this is by no means going to win an Oscar, but for what it is, it's pretty fun and certainly not a drag. A lot of the men hate this movie along with the others, and yes I'm a guy, but you know what, I don't care, I enjoyed Twilight (2008). Now I didn't exactly love Kristen Stewart, just because I don't think she has much range as an actress, but I thought she was OK in this movie. I also love the way it ended, not gonna say cus of spoilers, but just know I thought it was cool!"
insultingfilms101,"Jun 23, 2022",10/10,"No spoilers! - Twilighti dont even need to say anything about this movie.. it is just so perfect in every way, definitely for a specific audience but oh my gosh it is so perfect.Would recommend and would watch again!"
SnoopyStyle,"Jun 27, 2015",6/10,"Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) leaves Phoenix and her mother to live in Forks, Washington with her dad Charlie who is the Chief of Police. He bought her a truck from Billy Black and befriends Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) but he goes to school in the reservation. She makes a few new friends but is more intrigue by the Cullens especially Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward can't seem to stand her at first. Then he saves her with his supernatural powers. There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson. They are good actors and it's not that bad as far as overwrought teen melodrama is concerned. They are teenage star-crossed lovers and there's no shame in that."
mkniec,"Jul 18, 2009",2/10,"I realized that many people have seen this and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I knew that the film was a vampire romance, two genres that should never be mixed, so I simply asked myself: sparking vampires who stalk teenage females, how bad could it be? To my dismay what I found was a very shallow, tiring, detestable film. Let us first begin by looking at the writing. Perhaps some of the funniest dialog that I have seen in years, this film becomes increasingly disagreeable with every passing moment. With such immortal words as: ""You know, your mood swings are kinda giving me whiplash,"" and best of all: ""I'd compare (my life as a vampire) to living on tofu and soy milk,"" it seems obvious that I cannot take this film seriously. I distinctly remember literally falling to the floor laughing for most of it. I would love to say that this was where the horror ends but of course there was the sub par acting to contend with. Awkward moments punctuated by horrific gazes, this was a clumsy performance from both main actors. I only wish they would spend their newly found fortunes on acting lessons. The only item which I believe was tolerable was the directing. While there was nothing new to add to the cannon, with such an atrocious script and actors, I realize the director had a lot to contend with.I would beg the reader to never see this film. It was horrifyingly bad on nearly ever level, not worthy of its hype or fan base. Please avoid at all costs."
aubrielarkey,"Mar 22, 2009",1/10,"This movie actually made me feel like vomiting.Acting was terrible and I felt really embarrassed for them...Cringing every time Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) said anything. I Hope I never have to watch her in a movie again....EVER!!!Girls, if you are crazy enough to like this movie. Don't make your man watch it!!! He will HATE you for it and it will result in a massive argument.I really feel like I wasted 122 minutes of my life when I pressed play. Actually I have to add on another 5 minutes where I had to work out how to use my grandmothers DVD player. So I actually wasted 127 minutes.This review took me around 15 minutes but I feel like I have just claimed a bit of my life back by writing it."
claptonisgod53,"Jan 6, 2009",1/10,"""How Old Are You?"" ""17"" ""How long?"" ""A While"" ""What are you?"" ""A vampire... are you afraid?"" ""...No""This is the perfect example of how the script is layed out in Twilight. If a script's IQ is judged by how many words are in a sentence, this movie would be mentally unfit to be in public. This movie is truly poorly written. I wouldn't mind the movie as much if it didn't have such poor dialog. Since this is a dialog driven movie, I expect a good script, but it was god-awful. This movie hardly had any good vampire action. Hell, the vampires didn't even have any fangs.I realize that the books are well written and popular, but the company who produced Twilight better get a better writer. Otherwise the franchise will fall extremely flat, and all the teenagers watching the movies will wake up... very soon."
yyureka,"Oct 6, 2011",N/A,"We all know exactly why this film was made, let's not even pretend this was ever going to be any kind of artistic endeavour. Twilight exists solely to pander to the young girls demographic with pretty sparkly vampires and a blank slate of a heroine you can easily project your personality onto. Complete and utter wish fulfilment. Does the film do this well though? No. No it doesn't.For one thing, as a person who never falls asleep during films, this was so tediously hard to watch I almost fell asleep during the ""action packed climax"" of the film. The acting is dull as a blank sheet of A4 paper, a myriad of pale, drowsy eyed teenagers not finishing sentences and mumbling their lines. The few good actors this film manages to boast are shoved to one side for more pasty, nauseating ""romance"" between our two leads, Pattinson and Stewart. On the topic of the romance, there is absolutely no chemistry between our leads yet the film wants us so badly to believe that this is some kind of breath taking romance. I didn't buy it for a second.Even for the trashy romance novel on film that it is, It just doesn't work. It's poorly acted and painful to sit through. Skip it."
wehrwolfwagner,"Oct 6, 2025",10/10,"It doesn't get much better than this.A generational relic. An amulet of the past. The first of it's kind. United users of Tumblr and turned vampires into an archetype fit for the modern world. I pity anyone so blindsided by their esteemed definitions of cinema and standards, as they will never be able to approach the soulfully enriching experience of Twilight and truly understand it's cultural, and personal, significance. This movie was a step towards utopia."
stentygee123,"Nov 9, 2014",6/10,"Fast-paced and mysterious, I love the way Twilight reels people in through their curiosity making them wonder things like ""are they going to get hurt?"", ""are they in trouble?"" or the general ""what's going to happen next?"". The film itself is packed full of action and thrills and has benefited by basing itself on the amazing storyline of the same name by Stephanie Meyer. The fact that the movie uses a fictional-fantasy idea that is also an action packed thriller it reels in an audience of an age group between around 12 to around 40. Although mainly for the teens and disliked by quite a few people, it had proved to include the whole family on some level. The film uses the latest equipment in film technology to produce amazing atmospheres in the film that make the dark forests and similar scenes seem both captivating and realistic.Whether the film may have been created to make the idea of the film seem like it could be real life is undermined, though, by the over dramatic performances by the main protagonist, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), and the almost forced emotional approach by the character Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson).Kristen Stewart was way too over dramatic in her part as Bella Swan and made 80% of her part seem like a sob story or a cry for help, reminding me sometimes of Elijah Wood's portrayal of Frodo Baggins from The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Although she did well to capture her audience by making her entrance as the shy, uncomfortable, new girl seem both realistic, believable and relatable.Robert Pattinson was overly forceful in his attempt to be emotional as the character of Edward Cullen. While he got the eyes of the audience placed firmly on him, he lacked the natural human expression when feeling a strong emotion. For example: during the first kissing scene of the film he looked uncomfortable and shifty instead of the actual nervous and scared; and when trying to look sickened he overdid it and looked, frankly, constipated (I'm just saying...); and finally, when trying to look scared, he forced it too much and looked overly sad or angered. However, I give him that he did manage to capture his audience and reached the goal, enough so, that he went on to star in the last 4 installments of the book series.Overall, I would give the film a 9/10 for effort, but realistically given my overall opinion of the film I think it only deserves a 6/10"
julihadley,"Jun 21, 2022",10/10,Is it the best movie ever? No. But the acting isn't as bad as everyone says. And the cinematography is beautiful in the first one. Good to watch on a rainy day or when u have nothing to do. I thoroughly enjoyed.
joshuadrake-39480,"Apr 17, 2015",6/10,"The plot of the first film is really simple focuses on the development of a personal relationship between a girl named Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires.This film was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written, but Summit Entertainment bought the film rights in 2007, and all of the other TWILIGHT books were sold to Summit Entertainment.Originally scheduled for release in December 2008, the film was moved to a worldwide release of November 21, 2008, after the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moved from a November 2008 release to being released in July of 2009.Catherine Hardwicke directed this film, Carter Burwell did a really good job with the musical score, and the movie's soundtrack is phenomenal with amazing songs like, ""Let Me Sign"" and ""Bella's Lullaby"", both performed by Robert Pattinson, ""Decode"" , performed by Paramore and ""Leave Out All The Rest"", performed by Linkin Park. Melissa Rosenberg, wrote the heck out of a script based on the first book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer.Kristen Stewart is great as the lead character, Bella Swan. She is attractive and really cool, but also really great as well. Robert Pattinson is great as Edward Cullen, but this was not the first film he was in, I actually saw him as Cedric Diggory in both the fourth and fifth films in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and he really gave a great performance in this film.The two main actors were so great that they won an MTV Movie Award in 2009 for Best Kiss Scene in this film and they also shared a kiss at the award. This also won an MTV Movie Award in 2009, for Best Fight for Robert Pattinson vs. Cam Gigandet as James, Best Female Performance for Kristen Stewart, Best Male Performance for Robert Pattinson and Best Movie.Taylor Lautner, who was in both Cheaper by the Dozen films, and played the character Sharkboy in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which came out in 2005, played Jacob Black, really freaking amazing. Billy Burke is also really good as Charlie Swan.Anna Kendrick is hot and sweet as Jessica Stanley in this film and something told me that she was gonna be in more movies and in 2012, I saw her as Beca in the film Pitch Perfect and she will be playing the role again in the upcoming May 15th, 2015 sequel to the first film, Pitch Perfect 2. Kendrick can also sing because I heard her sing in the film and she is really good.Cam Gigandet, Rachel Levefre and Edi Gathegi plays the evil vampire clan. The rest of the cast is very awesome, but also really good. So, overall, i love the first TWILIGHT film. It's smart, fun and a good way to spend 2 hours.Out of all of the TWILIGHT films, this one, the third film, ECLIPSE, the final two films, BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE and BREAKING DAWN - PART TWO are the best ones so far, but the worst one is NEW MOON, which I will get to. Acting is not bad, music and story, and visual effects is not bad at all. I give it a 6 out of 10."
nilanna999,"Jun 12, 2011",2/10,"I give this movie 2 stars. And those 2 stars are not anything to do with the plot, but how BAD it is. It's so bad, it's almost good.Think of it as a comedy and you'll probably enjoy it. It's hilarious in the way The Room is hilarious. There are plot holes, bad acting and writing, and bad special effects. I was shocked that an actor I had seen actually do a good job (Pattinson) could sink so low. It was like he wasn't even trying.Honestly, I feel sorry for these actors. This movie is laughably bad and they'll be compared to it for the rest of their lives.Watch this movie with anti-Twilight fans and expect a fun evening full of laughter. But don't try to compare it to a decent movie."
miketaylor2007,"Mar 19, 2009",1/10,"I had no other choice but to give this film the lowest rating I can which will be a 1 since 0.5 isn't on the charts. I will explain to you why most people who like vampire movies will hate this movie to death. It goes the complete opposite direction of what anyone would want a decent vampire movie to have. There is pretty much no violence throughout the entire film, instead of being aggressive most of the vampires are friendly, the entire story is just about romance which makes the movie suck even worse. It was like watching the movie Clueless or TV series Degrassi High only no comedy and just strictly the ditzy chick stuff. Now combine that with the TV series True Blood but take out all of the violence and killing, and suspense. What do you get? The worst vampire movie ever made in the history of film making. I am a huge movie lover its very rare that I bash a film like this, but I can't say I have ever seen a movie that I hated so much before. My advice is to spare yourself from watching this movie."
himanshu809,"Feb 23, 2011",N/A,"First of all, I have read all the Twilight books thoroughly and i exactly know what the story is and what it's all about...... From the starting i thought them as some novels for teenagers(mostly girls) who live in the their own world of dreams and are living an illusion-ed, aimless life.I watched the movie purely out of curiosity and after 10 minutes i knew it's gonna be the longest 2 hours of my life... Kiddos, this isn't real love.....It's some boring author's shitty imagination and perception(wrong, by the way) what love should be.Recommended only for sex starved teenagers and die hard dumb twilight fans, rest....save your brains and get the hell out of the movie hall !!!!!!The storyline itself is nothing but below average.... The acting sucks literally, Edward aka Robert does nothing but screw his face as someone just kicked him between his legs and says; ""I love You, Bella !."" all the time.Bella has a fixed dumb founded look on her face for all the two hours....Rest all are not even worth mentioning.Oh man, people get a life !!!!!!!!!!!Its not real and it isn't even good imagination.....(hell its imagination at it's worst).Don't waste your time on this one, instead go have a quick nap (much much more productive than watching this crap).3/10Hell i'm giving 3 just because.......like you know.....a donation....It was painful to sit through his one....trust me you would like to watch some sing dance Indian movie instead !"
amyesmith71-2,"Apr 15, 2009",1/10,"REALLY? Was this REALLY a movie? Good grief.......I bought the silly thing on DVD because of all of the hype and now I'm gonna GIVE it away.I don't think that I've ever seen a movie where the interaction between the two main characters is SOOOOO awkward and the acting is SOOOOO bland that I wanna throw something at the TV! My husband and I were like, ""this thing better pick up"" after the first 45 minutes and then soon after that I was asleep and woke up to find that I hadn't missed a thing.Maybe I should have read the book first but judging from the other comments on here from various Twilight groupies, the movie was none-the-less disappointing.Free DVD to anyone who wants it........"
marchfifthabby,"Sep 13, 2023",10/10,"All of the haters and wannabe critics love to make fun of and tell you that this movie is a 4/10 and that they ""never even read the books cause they aren't a 16 year old girl"". Well as someone who was a 16 year old girl who read Twilight in book form and then enjoyed the movie years later... they did a great job on this movie! Whilst yes a little cheesy (some things don't always translate well from book form in most film adaptions). The acting was exactly perfect for the characters that Stephanie Meyers wrote. So even if they weren't the worlds best actors they did a great job in the role they were given. You try to be a hunger crazed teenage vampire who is actually 100's of years old, just met your soulmate who inadvertently happens to be your biggest weakness all the while ignoring your base instincts to kill. It's gotta be a tough gig.The cinematography of Twilight is beautiful and not just because of the scenery. Someone actually spent some love and care making this movie. They worked hard to respect the book and respect the atmosphere and feelings that it's meant to portray. This movie wasn't made for film critics or indie movie watchers or men or women who thought it was a joke even before they started it. It was made for the people who made it popular in the first place. The feelings this movie invokes are stronger than it's 5.3 rating. Twilight deserves better."
MissLena2u,"Apr 23, 2022",7/10,"Yes, this is very much a teen romance movie. Yes, it's filled with gringy flaws and completely unbelievable twists. And yes, Kristen Stuarts acting is almost unbearable to watch...(I mean, what the hell is going on with her face twitching and looking tormented all the time?!)
But still it's a movie that reflects the attraction people have always had with the sensual and seductive side of the vampire myth. And the tension between Bella and Edward is also satisfying to watch. So if you can relax and just accept all the awkwardness, you can definitely enjoy this film (and the sequels as well)."
chaosity_7629,"Apr 24, 2012",1/10,"I am normally a person to read the book that a movie is based off of before actually seeing the movie. That being said, I had no intention of reading or seeing Twilight. My friend asked me to simply read the book, which she claimed was much better than the movie, and go from there. I took her up on her offer and began reading the first book in the Twilight saga. After six chapters and pulling much of my hair out, I gave the book back to my friend and told her how agonizing it had been to read even those six chapters. She asked me to see the movie, thinking that I may like it more than the book.Well, I did see the movie, and spent the entirety of it with my mouth gaping at the awful cinematics, the horrible acting, and the terrible plot.Now, I understand that the movie, being based on the book, had no real plot to begin with and, therefore, could not help the story itself. however, there is no excuse for the poor choice of actors, the overly dramatized portrayal of the infatuation of a teenage girl, and horrible scenes. Even if the director had no plot to work with, he could have at least tried to make the scenes look good, much less chosen qualified actors for the dramatic characters of the story.In my opinion, there is no excuse for this film to have been as bad as it truly is. I have no respect for the author of the book nor the director, actors, makeup artists, of special effects teams of Twilight."
the-awesome-von-grimm,"Dec 10, 2014",6/10,"Talking about Twilight is like playing with fire. If you have real constructive criticism about this, you will probably burn of the whole world. If you say something positive about these movies, all the haters will hunt you down and kill you. If you say something negative, all the crazy girls will follow you home and choke you in your pillow. And if you say both positive and negative things I think they will first fight over you: who can kill you? Twilight is a teen movie that is way to depressing for a teen, but too over dramatic for an adult. Also, all the characters are just very awkward. I feel uncomfortable watching Edward and Bella talk."
igor-115,"Mar 19, 2009",1/10,"I've spent eight years working on movie productions all around Europe and many of them American,some good,some average and some very bad but this is a kind of movie I would not want to have my name on the credits.It is very hard to actually say what is the worst thing about ""Twilight"",from bad acting (maybe not they fault,since they are directed)to worst directing and absolutely stunningly bad writing and editing.I have to say that I'm sorry for lead male actor ,you get the filing that he has some potential that just get suffocated by his lead female partner and when I read some comments about ""amazing chemistry"" and ""sexuality"" between those two I just get the feeling that I watched entirely different movie.Expressionless face of the lead actress should never and I mean never bean put in the same sentence with sexuality or chemistry.I didn't read the books but I'm sure they cant be this bad,so for all the fans of the books,I beg you spare yourself a huge disappointment,And for all the others ,who didn't see the movie ,please don't because if this one makes enough money they gonna make another one(if they already didn't).If with this comment I saved at least one persons time lost it's worth it.Cheers"
DCJerzeygrl,"Nov 19, 2008",5/10,"Surprisingly good, of course it is sometimes a bit sugary, but that's to be expected in a teenage love story. Catherine Hardwicke did a great job, I love her edge. The casting director did well in choosing actors not movie stars to flesh out the book. Robert Pattinson plays the 'Hero' with the right amount of self-loathing and swagger. Kristen Stewart is believable and has a wonderfully tough vulnerability. You can almost see the supporting cast holding back a smile or grin, which made it even better. The Pacific Northwest looks gorgeous. It is a very important character in the film. Twilight made me want to take a trip to Oregon and Washington. A walk along the Cannon Beach coastline or canoe down the Salmon River would be lovely. And it would be worth every penny to hire a guide to hike to the stunning Multnomah Falls. Twilight's target audience will definitely see this movie several times. I believe the film will reach the magic box office number it needs to make sequels : )"

robfollower,"Mar 23, 2021",10/10,"I say boy's the Twilight Saga is way underappreciated ! I own all five films.
I didn't listen to the critics or the people that said their trash. I went and watched them for myself. I saw all five films in the theater.Then I bought all five Blu-rays but I have not watched them; they've been sitting in my Blu-ray pile for like 10 years :oops:The entire cast is made up of extremely attractive people physically , so theirs that.
I am total sap for a romantic star-crossed lovers story line and is element is the heart of the films.
There is all kinds of delicious Gothic and romantic melodrama.
I've never really been a huge fan of vampires in the horror genre but it's done extremely well in this series of films.
I've always been a huge fan of the Lycanthrope and there's plenty of Werewolf action.Twilight launched two bona fide movie stars in Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.
No shame, straight-up love The Twilight Saga ."
matthewtessnear,"Mar 3, 2019",6/10,"Twilight is a weird combo of blockbuster feel and low-budget independent film quality. The story is actually quite compelling. Kristen Stewart doesn't drive me mad like most people, but Robert Pattinson...I don't like him. Bella's new high school friends are so annoying. Songs by Linkin Park and Paramore on the soundtrack are actually my favorite moments. And that's not good."
lomaran-1,"Aug 14, 2009",1/10,"I saw nothing good in this film, although I really did like the (first) book.The cinematography is what really struck me as terrible. I really don't know what they were trying to convey with it (an avant-garde approach?), but it didn't work for me and I found I couldn't move past it. Perhaps, then, it tainted my opinion regarding the rest of the film, but I saw nothing good in it either; be it the soundtrack (poor), the dialogue/screenplay (lame) or the acting (overly hesitant at times).Quite honestly, I saw none of the chemistry that others have commented about regarding the two main characters. Their relationship developed much too quickly and wasn't adequately explained. Most of the early book takes place in Bella's thoughts, and that wasn't translated into the film. Edward went from apparently hating Bella to loving her almost overnight.We rented it through Netflix, and I am thankful for not having spent the $$ to see it in the theater. I doubt I bother with the others which are to (inevitably) follow."

clarks58,"Feb 8, 2024",7/10,"I find it quite funny how the Twilight series is rated so low and don't believe probably 80 percent of the reviews. Although the movies are not as good as the books. They capture the mood and feeling of them. I quite enjoy them and am not afraid to admit it at 65 years old. I see all the low ratings,but the money these movies made is staggering. Proving how popular and liked that they are. And it's not just the first movie and a fluke. They are really well made,beautiful photography especially. And you can never go wrong when Anna Kendricks involved.I think it's just popular for people to say these movies are dumb and stupid,like many things today. No one wants to admit they like them. Especially the first one.Give it a try."
lorrainewal,"Jun 9, 2009",1/10,"I couldn't wait to see my favorite book being brought to life on the big screen and instead 'Twilight' was released, in no way did it represent the book, it was an extremely disappointing movie.I appreciate this was a low budget film but come on..... the only way I knew the plot to this story was because I've read the book, if I hadn't have, I wouldn't have had a clue what this film was about, it felt like I was watching trailers not a movie.The Cullen's except for maybe Alice and Emmet were all completely wrong, as was Jake and his friends. What was with Jake's hair? You could tell it was false. James was like I imagined, however I thought Victoria had red hair? as for Edward Cullen he was descried as angelic looking, very well turned out wearing designer clothes, graceful and polite and he was none of the above, in fact he was quite the opposite all of the Cullen's were, none of them had the right actions or looks, and why was Bella so miserable and moody she didn't came across that way in the book.This movie and any others after will only be famous because of the books, and if the first movie Twilight is anything to go by the rest are going to be just as bad if not worse, if they insist on making any more movies then will someone please read the books and interpret the characters, scenes, actions everything correctly before putting us through another bad film, at least that way something good might be produced and worthy to watch.I would recommend the books to anyone but I definitely tell them to stay well clear of the film/s."
BillCollin,"Dec 18, 2008",1/10,"The film moved slowly and painfully. The story dragged along like a wet rag. It was tedious and the acting by the lead characters, had no passion, no sense of drama and no delivery. There was no build up or tension supposed to be conveyed by their forbidden love. I thought that the lead character Edward was supposed to be a handsome, sophisticated vampire, but was sadly disappointed by the unattractive choice in Robert Patterson. Bella, attractive enough even with all the white pasty makeup couldn't stoke the fires in even the most undead with her unconvincing performance of a love struck teen. Definitely steer clear of this movie, bad special effects, cheesy dialog and full of 'cringe' moments where the scenes are so bad you can help but shun your eyes. A huge sleeper."
LegendaryFang56,"Sep 16, 2025",7/10,"All of the people who thought (and continue to think) this is one of the worst films ever created have clearly never seen a truly bad film before. Here's how I'd categorize one: $10 budget, and the actors were random people selected off the street. Tell me with your chest that this film (but also the whole trilogy) is that bad. I thought this was decent enough. The soundtrack was obviously great. There was a sense of comedy and comedic undertones as well; some comedic lines and bits throughout, which were likely unintentional, yet they contributed to the overall charm."
deliadorner,"Feb 16, 2021",10/10,If you come into this expecting a fantastic movie you will be severely let down. But if you watch this with some friends at 3 am and make fun of it the whole time you will enjoy it immensely. Take my word on this: this movie is hilarious and is destined to be a cult classic.
siennajanesm,"May 17, 2019",6/10,This movie is so stupid. Sparkly vampires who can read minds and see into the future; mediocre action sequences; and abysmal dialogue all helped to make this a reasonably entertaining watch. I'd highly recommend it for your next boys' night.
iamjaysun,"Apr 4, 2009",1/10,"I have to first say I'm a fan of all movies, even chic-flix. I actually found something appealing about ""Legally Blonde"". With that said, I have to admit that Twilight is one of the most shameless attempts at appealing to the teen audience since the whole ""Dance-romance"" genre started.This movie made NO attempt to add any depth to a fairly shallow plot. For example, what was behind the attraction between the two lead characters?Was it a deep understanding of each others problems?, No. Maybe a bonding of two misfits, once again the answer is no. The viewer is forced to swallow that truth that there really is no reason behind the attraction other than the lead vampire being really cool and really hot and really mysterious. They then threw in every ""Cool Man"" cliché' in the book. He saves the damsel not once---not twice---but three times. He shows her things that NO MAN can EVER show her including trips over snow-capped mountains,treks through mile high trees, and tops it off by playing classical music while she sits in a luxurious chase lounge chair. Sounds too good to be true? Well not in Twilight.There's even a scene where the lead vampire tries to warn his love about the dangers of being with him by revealing his TRUE self. Do you think this TRUE self would resemble anything like an 100 year old vampire monster? Nope, his true self is actually even better than the way he looks normally with a sort of sparkling crystalline look. He asks her if its horrific. She says ""No,, it's Beautiful""-----That's because IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. What the hell was he warning her about ?These vampires apparently look exactly like they did when they were transformed. No beastly like creatures here all beauty but no substance."
suzi_sam,"Nov 3, 2022",10/10,"It has always been my go to movie when I can't find anything to watch. I watched it first in theaters with my daughters. I now find myself watching solely by myself. As a movie for teenagers, adults can also enjoy. As you follow each episode you find yourself in the fictional characters an the scenes building upto the finale. When you get to the last one you want another then another. When you get to the last one it is time for it to end you want there to be one more. As the books an the movies are a little different the movies still keeps your attention an you watch them from beginning to end."
Before2020,"Apr 19, 2022",7/10,"When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a dorky teen, soap opera but compared to the horrible movies of today, at least it had pretty actors to look at. No matter how much time goes by, it doesn't make Kristen's constipated acting any less horrible."
bamexp,"Nov 20, 2009",1/10,"Don't see this. This movie sucked so much ass, if I ever need to wipe and I'm out of Toilet Paper, please give me the film strip to this movie. It will be put to better use. Why was this movie made. The acting was TERRIBLE, the plot was TERRIBLE, and if you ever want to see another movie and this is on your list, replace it with ""Totoro, the Giant Dust Bunny"" or ""Horton Hears a Who"". You're time would be better spent reading Garfield comics upside down in the dark. Girls who love this movie, please comment and yell at me. I would love to hear what you have to think or this, I'm just giving you my honest opinion, I'm sorry if you loved the movie. P.s. Edward is terrible, I wish Edward would just end the movies and get some, we all know it's going to happen. And what happened to cool badass vampires such as ""Underworld"" and ""30 Days of Night"" where they killed people and were awesome?"
tashafriel,"Jan 18, 2009",2/10,the most boring film i have seen in a long time. i am a big fan of vampire movies but this one.......... no way.i sat there throughout the whole film wandering when something was going to happen.every time i did think a good bit was coming up i was let down.also bad acting from Kristen Stewart although i'm not sure its so much her acting as she is just dull and boring i was very disappointed in this film and it wasn't worth watching i certainly wont be running out to the shops to buy this one.another disappointing film with Kristen Stewart acting
honey_stars89,"Jun 9, 2009",1/10,"Was dragged to see this movie by friends...Was wanting to see IP man =( Let's just say, my 15.5 dollars spent was a HUGE HUGE WASTE of money.I never liked the book, thought it was VERY shallow, cliché, cheesy and just horribly written. However, the movie was worse, if that's even possible. The dialogue made me laugh in pain. The acting made me cringe inwardly for all of them. The storyline? Oh. My. Gawd.Don't see it. Spare yourself the mental anguish. Go watch paint dry or grass grow...ANYTHING is better than this UTTER piece of crap.I'd rather get a fix full of needles and stick em in both my eyes, than endure another min of twilight...or anything to do with it."
luvau2,"Feb 19, 2009",N/A,"This is the difference between reading the book and seeing the movie: The book is like talking to a Bella and getting all the details of her story and really feeling emotionally involved with her and her friends and all the characters because she's telling you everything that she felt and remembered. The Movie is like getting to see some of her home movies now, but you don't get every detail, and a few of the ""memories"" of how Bella told you the story were a little mixed up and you feel like there is so much more and why couldn't she just have videotaped her whole life for a reality show . . . it's just not fair! Well, at least that's how I felt after seeing the movie :)But, having read the book, you can at least feel like you know ""the rest of the story"" and can fill in the missing details of the movie in you mind. I can see where it's ""important"" to see it more than once. The first time, I just kept thinking, ""oh, they missed something"" or ""that's not how it happened"", and it just seemed like chopped pieces of the story here and there. Now, I think I can go and just relax, being excited to review the parts of Bella's home movies that she does have and enjoy those parts of her story visually. The Movie did seem ""Low Budget"", and the make-up didn't seem consistent in some of the scenes, but then, as ""Home Movies"" go, the lighting is never the same and I can just rationalize it that way. Hope this helps you to relax and enjoy the movie, and re-read the book and see the movie again... and, I just can't wait until New Moon is released, or Midnight Sun is finished . . . and hopefully one day, the continuation of the story (please Stephanie)."
moafuhr,"Apr 8, 2023",10/10,"When I first watched the movie, I hadn't read the books. I had heard of them but decided to see the movie to decide whether to read the books or not. And the film impressed me a lot and still does today! It is a low-budget film, unlike the other films in the saga, and that makes its quality even more impressive. It's amazing what Catherine Hardwick, the director, managed to produce on such a low budget!It is an excellent adaptation of the book, and what caught my attention the most was how well the city of Forks and the entire setting were built in an extremely realistic way. You really feel like entering this magical and mystical world. The soundtrack is beautiful, the entire cast was very well cast and well directed (the same cannot be said of the other films).I've watched the film several times, it always gives me great pleasure to feel the energy that emanates from this work. It's one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies in the saga."
Mediatation,"Oct 26, 2025",6/10,"Since the first ""Twilight"" novel was published, the franchise has had pop culture in a chokehold-forever influencing the romantic fantasy genre and sparking vocal opinions from nearly everyone. While the poor quality of the films is a popular opinion-even among some fans-their campy, cringy aspects make them undeniably entertaining films.Even with the hindsight of seeing Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's later acclaimed performances, their bizarre acting here remains just as jarring. Over-the-top filters aside, ""Twilight"" does a great job capturing the moody beauty of the Pacific Northwest."
raisasimonyan,"Mar 9, 2023",10/10,"I was surprised to learn that Stephanie Meyer had the idea for ""Twilight"" in a dream.""Twilight"" by Stephanie Meyer, is a young adult adventure-romance about a teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire.I like completely everything about this saga. Though it's parts are quite long, there are no tedious scenes in them. Many scenes are breathtaking.""Twilight"" tells the story of Bella, an average 17 year old girl who moves to Forks, WA, from sunny Arizona, to live with her father, after her mother remarries a travelling minor league baseball player. In Forks she meets Edward, a mysterious student, who is a vampire. They fall in love with each other at first sight and after that Bella's life turns upside down.All on all, ""Twilight"" does exactly what you would expect from a big budget adventure-romance. It's exciting and mesmerising.If you are looking for something deep and moving you should watch it."
ItsAllHappening-,"Jul 14, 2025",7/10,"Am I going to sit here and tell you Twilight is a perfect film? No. Am I going to tell you it's bad? Sometimes. Do I love it? Yes. Would I change anything about it? No. This movie is filmed beautifully, in its iconic blue tones, standout lines, and honestly pretty accurate character portrayal. Of course there are cringy parts, it's Twilight. But that's why I watch it. I'd be lying to you if I said I don't enjoy this movie. Kristen Stewart is controversial in this movie but I think the hate is unjustified. I can't and don't want to imagine anyone else as Bella. Robert Pattinson is and always has been the perfect Edward Cullen. Not to mention, he's great in so many other films, I felt his portrayal was pretty damn good."
ClumpyButtfloss,"Dec 28, 2010",2/10,"Well I can't help but give Meyer some credit for her own originality in this story. Unfortunately in doing so, she stripped the meaning of vampire completely out of her story. I didn't know that vampires ate little animals, had a perfect set of teeth, and sparkle like Christina Aguilera in sunlight!?(no way!) As for Bella, she was pretty awkward, and I couldn't help but notice how uncomfortably constipated Edward looked throughout the whole film. From the character development to the messed up love triangle, in all honesty, the most believable character was her dad, who wasn't in the film but for a couple short scenes. It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but was definitely given more credit than it deserved (hence the immense amount of 12 year old fans, twi-tard shirts and other merch that is still stocked at Hot Topic.) So if you like the idea of a made up creature that was originally supposed to horrify people, be portrayed as a harmless sparkling fairy-boy who cannot make up his damned mind, then by all means watch it."
Bigjon121388,"Feb 11, 2011",N/A,"Vampires...They have the the ability to turn into bats. They wear long dark capes and have black slicked back hair. They prey on the innocent for sustenance, they...sparkle?Twilight is basically a teenage girl's fantasy brought onto the big screen. In fact that's exactly what it is. Stephenie Meyer who wrote the just as popular book openly admitted that it was inspired by a teenage fantasy she had.So maybe other teenage girls and their lonely moms can relate, but what does that mean for the rest of us? Well put simply, it means that it sucks.Twilight's plot revolves around the idea of a girl falling in love with a vampire that lusts for her blood and somehow this makes her love him more. Sounds stupid doesn't it? Well it doesn't end there.The characters are paper thin, and Edward Cullen and his fellowship of fanged fellows all look like their makeup artists went a little to far with the makeup and not far enough with presentation. Edward himself is someone who tries to be mysterious and longing and Bella, who admits to being average, comes of as nothing more than that, yet her blood must be above average in Edward's opinion and Bella risks her life for his desire, is it because she loves him or is it because she thinks he's awesome for being a vampire? don't scenarios like this happen with teens in real life? It's not him, it's his car...Anyway, about the film. The look of it is about on the same level as a high-budget TV series and comes off as cheap and bland. The CGI effects are some of the most laughable and goofy looking effects seen in awhile. There's one scene where Edward, ""sparkles,"" when exposed to sunlight and there's the running scene that looks highly unconvincing. The sparkles are also a unconvincing part of the story itself. I know these aren't your classic vampires, but sparkling is just lazy.One of the main reasons the story falls on itself is because, Edward says he wants to ""protect,"" Bella, yet creates a constant danger to her. It seems like if he really cared about her, he wouldn't put her at risk, but what do expect from someone who's 104 years old and is still in High School?Twilight tries to convincing and epic, but comes off about as much as a Syfy original and it's weak plot and undeveloped characters come off as un-inspired. It's nothing more than a dumbed down romance and an even dumber fantasy. Unless you're a 13 to 16 year old girl or a lonely mother or grandmother, don't waste your time here."
DarklyDreamingFan,"Oct 28, 2025",8/10,"⭐ Overall Rating: 8/10 (for nostalgia), 6/10 (as cinema)Twilight is one of those rare films that became both a cultural phenomenon and a meme goldmine. It's melodramatic, awkward, and utterly sincere and that's exactly why it works.Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a perpetually awkward teen, moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Forks, Washington. There she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). A mysterious, brooding classmate who happens to be a 100-year-old vampire. Against all reason and biological sense, they fall in love... while Edward resists the urge to drink her blood.It's gothic romance meets teen angst. All delivered through blue-tinted cinematography and painfully intense stares.✅ What Worked1. Catherine Hardwicke's Direction: The Twilight that started it all has a raw, indie feel before the later sequels went full blockbuster. Hardwicke's direction is dreamy, moody, and unapologetically emo.2. The Chemistry (and Chaos): Stewart and Pattinson's chemistry is awkward but electric. Their tension feels real, half because of the script, half because both look constantly confused and in love.3. The Soundtrack = Perfection: Paramores Decode, Muse's Supermassive Black Hole, Iron & Wine's Flightless Bird, American Mouth. The soundtrack is the soul of Twilight. It defined 2000s emo-romantic aesthetics.4. Forks' Atmosphere: The constant rain, mossy forests, and muted tones create a melancholy world that perfectly mirrors Bella's emotional turmoil.5. Pure Earnestness: There's no irony here. Twilight believes in its love story completely. That sincerity gives it lasting charm, especially compared to today's self-aware films.❌ What Didn't Work1. The Dialogue: Lines like ""Your skin is pale white and ice cold... I know what you are."" and ""Hold on tight, spider monkey"" are legendary but not for their writing quality.2. Pacing Issues: The film moves at a strange rhythm. Long stretches of staring, then sudden vampire baseball.3. Visual Effects (Even Then): Sparkly vampires were a bold creative choice. Let's just say... they didn't age as gracefully as Edward did.4. Edward's Behavior: Rewatching today, his controlling tendencies (""I like watching you sleep"") hit differently and not always romantically.💬 Favorite Quotes / Moments""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.""
""You better hold on tight, spider monkey.""
The first biology lab scene.Vampire baseball under thunder and Paramore.The final dance scene.🎶 The Soundtrack Deserves Its Own SectionFew soundtracks defined an era like this one.If you were a teenager in 2008, you felt something when you heard:
🎵 ""I can't escape this now, unless you show me how...""
🎵 ""Flightless Bird, American Mouth""🍎 If You Liked This, You Might Also Enjoy1. The Hunger Games: moody teen dystopia, moral ambiguity, love triangle energy.2. Beautiful Creatures: southern gothic romance with supernatural flair.3. Warm Bodies: a zombie twist on the Twilight formula.4. Buffy the Vampire Slayer: the smarter, sassier cousin to Twilight.5. The Vampire Diaries: the TV series that perfected the brooding vampire love triangle.💭 Final ThoughtsTwilight may not be a ""great"" movie but it's an important one. It defined a generation of romantic fantasy, launched two megastars, and gave the world a decade of memes and nostalgia.It's cringe, yes. But it's iconic cringe. A relic of sincerity in an age of irony.Final Verdict: 8/10 (for the heart), 6/10 (for the craft). ✨ It's messy, melodramatic, and unforgettable just like first love."
Bernie4444,"May 8, 2024",6/10,"Stephenie Meyer's novel ""Twilight"" is adapted for film by Melissa Rosenberg. Melissa kept the essence of this Gothic Romance and most of the story in the film as to not disappoint the readers. Elliot Davis's Cinematography makes this film a perfect candidate for Blu-ray.This is a standard story of a girl (Kristen Stewart) with tasty smelling blood, type unknown, meets a vampire (Robert Pattinson) who cannot resist a nibble.The film is set up as a beginning series so some characters just can't/won't die.Lots of inbreeding, fighting, and a never-ending love story.This is a first installment of a series of films."
carbonfiller,"May 28, 2009",2/10,"Twilight was made for viewers that do not look at film critically, or even look at film for well constructed thought. On that note, I was able to watch it and be entertained, but not because its a good story or movie. Maybe that is the key, this movie is for people who purely like to be entertained and not think about the 'why's' and the 'how's'. This is kind of sad because I really like movies that stretch outside of reality, but Twilight was more ridiculous than reality bending.If this movie came out in the 80's it most definitely would have lend itself to having a cartoon made after it. The theme song could have gone something like ""Twilight, na na na, sparkly vampire take you on a magical ride, na na na, they fight the other vampires cause you smell so good, na na na, twilight vampires don't eat people cause they like to eat cats, na na na,.."" (the other 2 and a half mins of the theme song would be kind of repetitive, but you get the idea) Twilight the animated show would have aired right after The Real Ghostbusters and right before Gummy Bears. Image that next time you watch Twilight."
nolacrazygrl,"Sep 18, 2022",7/10,"When these came out I only watched the first one. I didn't think it was horrible as it kept me intrigued enough to make it completely through without turning it off. Back then it definitely wasn't my thing so I didn't watch the others. This weekend all of them were on marathon style so I decided to watch again. Still feel the same - not horrible, not the greatest but still held my attention enough to watch all 5 of them this time. I wasn't impressed with the storyline of Breaking Dawn part 1 (4th movie) at all as it lacked any amount of excitement. I had to look up a few things on google that were happening bc I didn't read the books and either I missed its explanation in the movies or they didn't cover why it was happening/what it meant. I can see how this would appeal to the young crowd, at least back when they were originally released. There are many movies I watched when younger that I can't even sit through now even to feel nostalgia, so that's why I decided to give this a 7 rating."
preetwalia88,"Aug 8, 2011",1/10,"In the book Bella is supposed to be awkward but Kristen Stewart goes way to far with it. She breathes and sighs in random places and her monotonous facial expression makes it hard to tell if shes upset or amused Robert Pattinson, who could be a good actor with a little push was in a difficult position to pull the movie together due to Kristen's lack luster performance In the end he failed...however unlike Kristen i see potential in Robert to become better in the rest of the saga Characters like Jacob, Alice, Rosalie, jasper, and Emmet show a lot of potential and i hope the director gives them more screen time in the other movies The direction of the movie is REALLY sloppy"
